<p><span class="sc">It</span> is with no common pleasure that I take
up my pen to dedicate these volumes to you. They are the result of
trains of thought which have often been the subject of our
conversation, and of which the origin goes back to the period of our
early companionship at the University. And if I had ever wavered in my
purpose of combining such reflections and researches into a whole, I
should have derived a renewed impulse and increased animation from
your delightful Discourse on a kindred subject. For I could not have
read it without finding this portion of philosophy invested with a
fresh charm; and though I might be well aware that I could not aspire
to that large share of popularity which your work so justly gained, I
should still have reflected, that something was due to the subject
itself, and should have hoped that my own aim was so far similar to
yours, that the present work might have a chance of exciting an
interest in some of your readers. That it will interest you, I do not
at all hesitate to believe.</p>
<p>If you were now in England I should stop here: but when a friend is
removed for years to a far distant land, we seem to acquire a right to
speak openly of his good qualities. I cannot, therefore, prevail upon
myself to lay down my pen without alluding to the affectionate
admiration of your moral and social, as well as intellectual
excellencies, which springs up in the hearts of your friends, whenever
you are thought of. They are much delighted to look upon the halo of
deserved fame which plays round your head but still more, to
recollect, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page6">6</a></span> as one
of them said, that your head is far from being the best part about
you.</p>
<p>May your sojourn in the southern hemisphere be as happy and
successful as its object is noble and worthy of you; and may your
return home be speedy and prosperous, as soon as your purpose is
attained.</p>
<p class="quotsig">Ever, my dear Herschel, yours,</p>
<p class="right sc">W. Whewell.</p>
<p class="small">March 22, 1837.</p>
<p>P.S. So I wrote nearly ten years ago, when you were at the Cape of
Good Hope, employed in your great task of making a complete standard
survey of the nebulæ and double stars visible to man. Now that you
are, as I trust, in a few weeks about to put the crowning stone upon
your edifice by the publication of your “Observations in the Southern
Hemisphere,” I cannot refrain from congratulating you upon having had
your life ennobled by the conception and happy execution of so great a
design, and once more offering you my wishes that you may long enjoy
the glory you have so well won.</p>

<h2>PREFACE<br />
<span class="space smaller">TO THE THIRD EDITION</span>.</h2></div>
<hr class="two" />
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IN</span> the Prefaces to the
previous Editions of this work, several remarks were made which it is
not necessary now to repeat to the same extent. That a History of the
Sciences, executed as this is, has some value in the eyes of the
Public, is sufficiently proved by the circulation which it has
obtained. I am still able to say that I have seen no objection urged
against the plan of the work, and scarcely any against the details.
The attempt to throw the history of each science into <span
class="sc">Epochs</span> at which some great and cardinal discovery
was made, and to arrange the subordinate events of each history as
belonging to the  <span class="sc">Preludes</span> and the  <span
class="sc">Sequels</span> of such Epochs, appears to be assented to,
as conveniently and fairly exhibiting the progress of scientific
truth. Such a view being assumed, as it was a constant light and guide
to the writer in his task, so will it also, I think, make the view of
the reader far more clear and comprehensive than it could otherwise
be. With regard to the manner in which this plan has been carried into
effect with reference to particular writers and their researches, as I
have said, I have seen scarcely any objection made. I was aware, as I
stated at the outset, of the difficulty and delicacy of the office
which I had undertaken; but I had various considerations to encourage
me to go through it; and I had a trust, which I <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page8">8</a></span> have as yet seen nothing
to disturb, that I should be able to speak impartially of the great
scientific men of all ages, even of our own.</p>
<p>I have already said, in the Introduction, that the work aimed at
being, not merely a narration of the facts in the history of Science,
but a basis for the Philosophy of Science. It seemed to me that our
study of the modes of discovering truth ought to be based upon a
survey of the truths which have been discovered. This maxim, so
stated, seems sufficiently self-evident; yet it has, even up to the
present time, been very rarely acted on. Those who discourse
concerning the nature of Truth and the mode of its discovery, still,
commonly, make for themselves examples of truths, which for the most
part are utterly frivolous and unsubstantial (as in most Treatises on
Logic); or else they dig up, over and over, the narrow and special
field of mathematical truth, which certainly cannot, of itself,
exemplify the general mode by which man has attained to the vast body
of certain truth which he now possesses.</p>
<p>Yet it must not be denied that the Ideas which form the basis of
Mathematical Truth are concerned in the formation of Scientific Truth
in general; and discussions concerning these Ideas are by no means
necessarily barren of advantage. But it must be borne in mind that,
besides these Ideas, there are also others, which no less lie at the
root of Scientific Truth; and concerning which there have been, at
various periods, discussions which have had an important bearing on
the progress of Scientific Truth;&#8212;such as discussions concerning
the nature and necessary attributes of Matter, of Force, of Atoms, of
Mediums, of Kinds, of Organization. The controversies which have taken
place concerning these have an important place in the history of
Natural Science in <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page9">9</a></span>
its most extended sense. Yet it appeared convenient to carry on the
history of Science, so far as it depends on Observation, in a line
separate from these discussions concerning Ideas. The account of these
discussions and the consequent controversies, therefore, though it be
thoroughly historical, and, as appears to me, a very curious and
interesting history, is reserved for the other work, the <i>Philosophy
of the Inductive Sciences</i>. Such a history has, in truth, its
natural place in the Philosophy of Science; for the Philosophy of
Science at the present day must contain the result and summing up of
all the truth which has been disentangled from error and confusion
during these past controversies.</p>
<p>I have made a few Additions to the present Edition; partly, with a
view of bringing up the history, at least of some of the Sciences, to
the present time,&#8212;so far as those larger features of the History
of Science are concerned, with which alone I have here to
deal,&#8212;and partly also, especially in the First Volume, in order
to rectify and enlarge some of the earlier portions of the history.
Several works which have recently appeared suggested reconsideration
of various points; and I hoped that my readers might be interested in
the reflections so suggested.</p>
<p>I will add a few sentences from the Preface to the First
Edition.</p>
<p>“As will easily be supposed, I have borrowed largely from other
writers, both of the histories of special sciences and of philosophy
in general.<a id="fnanchor1-P" href="#note1-P"><span
class="fnanchor">1</span></a> I have done this without <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page10">10</a></span> scruple, since the
novelty of my work was intended to consist, not in its superiority as
a collection of facts, but in the point of view in which the facts
were placed. I have, however, in all cases, given references to my
authorities, and there are very few instances in which I have not
verified the references of previous historians, and studied the
original authors. According to the plan which I have pursued, the
history of each science forms a whole in itself, divided into distinct
but connected members, by the <i>Epochs</i> of its successive
advances. If I have satisfied the competent judges in each science by
my selection of such epochs, the scheme of the work must be of
permanent value, however imperfect may be the execution of any of its
portions.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-P"
href="#fnanchor1-P">1</a></span> Among these, I may mention as works
to which I have peculiar obligations, Tennemann’s Geschichte der
Philosophie; Degerando’s Histoire Comparée des Systèmes de
Philosophie; Montucla’s Histoire des Mathématiques, with Delalande’s
continuation of it; Delambre’s Astronomie Ancienne, Astronomie du
Moyen Age, Astronomie Moderne, and Astronomie du Dix-huitième Siècle;
Bailly’s Histoire d’Astronomie Ancienne, and Histoire d’Astronomie
Moderne; Voiron’s Histoire d’Astronomie (published as a continuation
of Bailly), Fischer’s Geschichte der Physik, Gmelin’s Geschichte der
Chemie, Thomson’s History of Chemistry, Sprengel’s History of
Medicine, his History of Botany, and in all branches of Natural
History and Physiology, Cuvier’s works; in their historical, as in all
other portions, most admirable and instructive.</div>
<p>“With all these grounds of hope, it is still impossible not to see
that such an undertaking is, in no small degree, arduous, and its
event obscure. But all who venture upon such tasks must gather trust
and encouragement from reflections like those by which their great
forerunner prepared himself for his endeavors;&#8212;by recollecting
that they are aiming to advance the best interests and privileges of
man; and that they may expect all the best and wisest of men to join
them in their aspirations and to aid them in their labors.</p>
<p>“‘Concerning ourselves we speak not; but as touching the matter
which we have in hand, this we ask;&#8212;that men deem it not to be
the setting up of an Opinion, but the performing of a Work; and that
they receive this as a certainty&#8212;that we are not laying the
foundations of any sect or doctrine, but of the profit and dignity of
mankind:&#8212;Furthermore, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page11">11</a></span> that being well disposed to what shall
advantage themselves, and putting off factions and prejudices, they
take common counsel with us, to the end that being by these our aids
and appliances freed and defended from wanderings and impediments,
they may lend their hands also to the labors which remain to be
performed:&#8212;And yet, further, that they be of good hope; neither
feign and imagine to themselves this our Reform as something of
infinite dimension and beyond the grasp of mortal man, when, in truth,
it is, of infinite error, the end and true limit; and is by no means
unmindful of the condition of mortality and humanity, not confiding
that such a thing can be carried to its perfect close in the space of
one single day, but assigning it as a task to a succession of
generations.’&#8212;<span class="sc">Bacon&#8212;Instauratio
Magna</span>, <i>Præf. ad fin.</i></p>
<p>“‘If there be any man who has it at heart, not merely to take his
stand on what has already been discovered, but to profit by that, and
to go on to something beyond;&#8212;not to conquer an adversary by
disputing, but to conquer nature by working;&#8212;not to opine
probably and prettily, but to know certainly and
demonstrably;&#8212;let such, as being true sons of nature (if they
will consent to do so), join themselves to us; so that, leaving the
porch of nature which endless multitudes have so long trod, we may at
last open a way to the inner courts. And that we may mark the two
ways, that old one, and our new one, by familiar names, we have been
wont to call the one the <i>Anticipation of the Mind</i>, the other,
the <i>Interpretation of Nature</i>.’&#8212;<span class="sc">Inst.

<h3 class="space-above">INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<hr class="one" />
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IT</span> is my purpose to write the
History of some of the most important of the Physical Sciences, from
the earliest to the most recent periods. I shall thus have to trace
some of the most remarkable branches of human knowledge, from their
first germ to their growth into a vast and varied assemblage of
undisputed truths; from the acute, but fruitless, essays of the early
Greek Philosophy, to the comprehensive systems, and demonstrated
generalizations, which compose such sciences as the Mechanics,
Astronomy, and Chemistry, of modern times.</p>
<p>The completeness of historical view which belongs to such a design,
consists, not in accumulating all the details of the cultivation of
each science, but in marking the larger features of its formation. The
historian must endeavor to point out how each of the important
advances was made, by which the sciences have reached their present
position; and when and by whom each of the valuable truths was
obtained, of which the aggregate now constitutes a costly
treasure.</p>
<p>Such a task, if fitly executed, must have a well-founded interest
for all those who look at the existing condition of human knowledge
with complacency and admiration. The present generation finds itself
the heir of a vast patrimony of science; and it must needs concern us
to know the steps by which these possessions were acquired, and the
documents by which they are secured to us and our heirs forever. Our
species, from the time of its creation, has been travelling onwards in
pursuit of truth; and now that we have reached a lofty and commanding
position, with the broad light of day around us, it must be grateful
to look back on the line of our vast progress;&#8212;to review the
journey, begun in early twilight amid primeval wilds; for a long time
continued with slow advance and obscure prospects; and gradually and
in later days followed along more open and lightsome paths, in a wide
and fertile region. The historian of science, from early periods to
the present times, may hope for favor on the score of the mere subject
of his narrative, and in virtue of the curiosity which the men <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page42">42</a></span> of the present day may
naturally feel respecting the events and persons of his story.</p>
<p>But such a survey may possess also an interest of another kind; it
may be instructive as well as agreeable; it may bring before the
reader the present form and extent, the future hopes and prospects of
science, as well as its past progress. The eminence on which we stand
may enable us to see the land of promise, as well as the wilderness
through which we have passed. The examination of the steps by which
our ancestors acquired our intellectual estate, may make us acquainted
with our expectations as well as our possessions;&#8212;may not only
remind us of what we have, but may teach us how to improve and
increase our store. It will be universally expected that a History of
Inductive Science should point out to us a philosophical distribution
of the existing body of knowledge, and afford us some indication of
the most promising mode of directing our future efforts to add to its
extent and completeness.</p>
<p>To deduce such lessons from the past history of human knowledge,
was the intention which originally gave rise to the present work. Nor
is this portion of the design in any measure abandoned; but its
execution, if it take place, must be attempted in a separate and
future treatise, <i>On the Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences</i>.
An essay of this kind may, I trust, from the progress already made in
it, be laid before the public at no long interval after the present
history.<a id="fnanchor1-1" href="#note1-1"><span
class="fnanchor">1</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-1"
href="#fnanchor1-1">1</a></span> The <i>Philosophy of the Inductive
Sciences</i> was published shortly after the present work.</div>
<p>Though, therefore, many of the principles and maxims of such a work
will disclose themselves with more or less of distinctness in the
course of the history on which we are about to enter, the systematic
and complete exposition of such principles must be reserved for this
other treatise. My attempts and reflections have led me to the
opinion, that justice cannot be done to the subject without such a
division of it.</p>
<p>To this future work, then, I must refer the reader who is disposed
to require, at the outset, a precise explanation of the terms which
occur in my title. It is not possible, without entering into this
philosophy, to explain adequately how science which is <span
class="sc">Inductive</span> differs from that which is not so; or why
some portions of <em>knowledge</em> may properly be selected from the
general mass and termed <span class="sc">Science</span>. It will be
sufficient at present to say, that the sciences of which we have <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page43">43</a></span> here to treat, are
those which are commonly known as the <i>Physical Sciences</i>; and
that by <i>Induction</i> is to be understood that process of
collecting general truths from the examination of particular facts, by
which such sciences have been formed.</p>
<p>There are, however, two or three remarks, of which the application
will occur so frequently, and will tend so much to give us a clearer
view of some of the subjects which occur in our history, that I will
state them now in a brief and general manner.</p>
<p><i>Facts and Ideas</i>.<a id="fnanchor2-1" href="#note2-1"><span
class="fnanchor">2</span></a>&#8212;In the first place then, I remark,
that, to the formation of science, two things are
requisite;&#8212;Facts and Ideas; observation of Things without, and
an inward effort of Thought; or, in other words, Sense and Reason.
Neither of these elements, by itself can constitute substantial
general knowledge. The impressions of sense, unconnected by some
rational and speculative principle, can only end in a practical
acquaintance with individual objects; the operations of the rational
faculties, on the other hand, if allowed to go on without a constant
reference to external things, can lead only to empty abstraction and
barren ingenuity. Real speculative knowledge demands the combination
of the two ingredients;&#8212;right reason, and facts to reason upon.
It has been well said, that true knowledge is the interpretation of
nature; and therefore it requires both the interpreting mind, and
nature for its subject; both the document, and the ingenuity to read
it aright. Thus invention, acuteness, and connection of thought, are
necessary on the one hand, for the progress of philosophical
knowledge; and on the other hand, the precise and steady application
of these faculties to facts well known and clearly conceived. It is
easy to point out instances in which science has failed to advance, in
consequence of the absence of one or other of these requisites;
indeed, by far the greater part of the course of the world, the
history of most times and most countries, exhibits a condition thus
stationary with respect to knowledge. The facts, the impressions on
the senses, on which the first successful attempts at physical
knowledge proceeded, were as well known long before the time when they
were thus turned to account, as at that period. The motions of the
stars, and the effects of weight, were familiar to man before the rise
of the Greek Astronomy and Mechanics: but the “diviner mind” was still
absent; the act of thought had not been exerted, by which these facts
were bound together under the form of laws and principles. And even at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page44">44</a></span> this day, the
tribes of uncivilized and half-civilized man, over the whole face of
the earth, have before their eyes a vast body of facts, of exactly the
same nature as those with which Europe has built the stately fabric of
her physical philosophy; but, in almost every other part of the earth,
the process of the intellect by which these facts become science, is
unknown. The scientific faculty does not work. The scattered stones
are there, but the builder’s hand is wanting. And again, we have no
lack of proof that mere activity of thought is equally inefficient in
producing real knowledge. Almost the whole of the career of the Greek
schools of philosophy; of the schoolmen of Europe in the middle ages;
of the Arabian and Indian philosophers; shows us that we may have
extreme ingenuity and subtlety, invention and connection,
demonstration and method; and yet that out of these germs, no physical
science may be developed. We may obtain, by such means, Logic and
Metaphysics, and even Geometry and Algebra; but out of such materials
we shall never form Mechanics and Optics, Chemistry and Physiology.
How impossible the formation of these sciences is without a constant
and careful reference to observation and experiment;&#8212;how rapid
and prosperous their progress may be when they draw from such sources
the materials on which the mind of the philosopher employs
itself;&#8212;the history of those branches of knowledge for the last
three hundred years abundantly teaches us.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note2-1"
href="#fnanchor2-1">2</a></span> For the <i>Antithesis of Facts and
Ideas</i>, see the <i>Philosophy</i>, book i. ch. 1, 2, 4, 5.</div>
<p>Accordingly, the existence of clear Ideas applied to distinct Facts
will be discernible in the History of Science, whenever any marked
advance takes place. And, in tracing the progress of the various
provinces of knowledge which come under our survey, it will be
important for us to see that, at all such epochs, such a combination
has occurred; that whenever any material step in general knowledge has
been made,&#8212;whenever any philosophical discovery arrests our
attention,&#8212;some man or men come before us, who have possessed,
in an eminent degree, a clearness of the ideas which belong to the
subject in question, and who have applied such ideas in a vigorous and
distinct manner to ascertained facts and exact observations. We shall
never proceed through any considerable range of our narrative, without
having occasion to remind the reader of this reflection.</p>
<p><i>Successive Steps in Science</i>.<a id="fnanchor3-1"
href="#note3-1"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a>&#8212;But there is
another remark which we must also make. Such sciences as we have here
to do with are, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page45">45</a></span>
commonly, not formed by a single act;&#8212;they are not completed by
the discovery of one great principle. On the contrary, they consist in
a long-continued advance; a series of changes; a repeated progress
from one principle to another, different and often apparently
contradictory. Now, it is important to remember that this
contradiction is apparent only. The principles which constituted the
triumph of the preceding stages of the science, may appear to be
subverted and ejected by the later discoveries, but in fact they are
(so far as they were true) taken up in the subsequent doctrines and
included in them. They continue to be an essential part of the
science. The earlier truths are not expelled but absorbed, not
contradicted but extended; and the history of each science, which may
thus appear like a succession of revolutions, is, in reality, a series
of developments. In the intellectual, as in the material world,</p>
<div class="poem">

</div>
<p class="noind">Nothing which was done was useless or unessential,

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note3-1"
href="#fnanchor3-1">3</a></span> Concerning <i>Successive
Generalizations in Science</i> see the <i>Philosophy</i>, book i. ch.
2, sect. 11.</div>
<p>Thus the final form of each science contains the substance of each
of its preceding modifications; and all that was at any antecedent
period discovered and established, ministers to the ultimate
development of its proper branch of knowledge. Such previous doctrines
may require to be made precise and definite, to have their superfluous
and arbitrary portions expunged, to be expressed in new language, to
be taken up into the body of science by various processes;&#8212;but
they do not on such accounts cease to be true doctrines, or to form a
portion of the essential constituents of our knowledge.</p>
<p><i>Terms record Discoveries</i>.<a id="fnanchor4-1"
href="#note4-1"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a>&#8212;The modes in
which the earlier truths of science are preserved in its later forms,
are indeed various. From being asserted at first as strange
discoveries, such truths come at last to be implied as almost
self-evident axioms. They are recorded by some familiar maxim, or
perhaps by some new word or phrase, which becomes part of the current
language of the philosophical world; and thus asserts a principle,
while it appears merely to indicate a transient <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page46">46</a></span> notion;&#8212;preserves
as well as expresses a truth;&#8212;and, like a medal of gold, is a
treasure as well as a token. We shall frequently have to notice the
manner in which great discoveries thus stamp their impress upon the
terms of a science; and, like great political revolutions, are
recorded by the change of the current coin which has accompanied
them.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note4-1"
href="#fnanchor4-1">4</a></span> Concerning <i>Technical Terms</i>,
see <i>Philosophy</i>, book i. ch. 3.</div>
<p><i>Generalization</i>.&#8212;The great changes which thus take
place in the history of science, the revolutions of the intellectual
world, have, as a usual and leading character, this, that they are
steps of <em>generalization</em>; transitions from particular truths
to others of a wider extent, in which the former are included. This
progress of knowledge, from individual facts to universal
laws,&#8212;from particular propositions to general ones,&#8212;and
from these to others still more general, with reference to which the
former generalizations are particular,&#8212;is so far familiar to
men’s minds, that, without here entering into further explanation, its
nature will be understood sufficiently to prepare the reader to
recognize the exemplifications of such a process, which he will find
at every step of our advance.</p>
<p><i>Inductive Epochs; Preludes; Sequels</i>.&#8212;In our history,
it is the <em>progress</em> of knowledge only which we have to attend
to. This is the main action of our drama; and all the events which do
not bear upon this, though they may relate to the cultivation and the
cultivators of philosophy, are not a necessary part of our theme. Our
narrative will therefore consist mainly of successive steps of
generalization, such as have just been mentioned. But among these, we
shall find some of eminent and decisive importance, which have more
peculiarly influenced the fortunes of physical philosophy, and to
which we may consider the rest as subordinate and auxiliary. These
primary movements, when the Inductive process, by which science is
formed, has been exercised in a more energetic and powerful manner,
may be distinguished as the <i>Inductive Epochs</i> of scientific
history; and they deserve our more express and pointed notice. They
are, for the most part, marked by the great discoveries and the great
philosophical names which all civilized nations have agreed in
admiring. But, when we examine more clearly the history of such
discoveries, we find that these epochs have not occurred suddenly and
without preparation. They have been preceded by a period, which we may
call their <i>Prelude</i> during which the ideas and facts on which
they turned were called into action;&#8212;were gradually evolved into
clearness and connection, permanency and certainty; till at last the
discovery which marks the epoch, seized and fixed forever the truth
which had till then been obscurely and <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page47">47</a></span> doubtfully discerned. And again, when this
step has been made by the principal discoverers, there may generally
be observed another period, which we may call the <i>Sequel</i> of the
Epoch, during which the discovery has acquired a more perfect
certainty and a more complete development among the leaders of the
advance; has been diffused to the wider throng of the secondary
cultivators of such knowledge, and traced into its distant
consequences. This is a work, always of time and labor, often of
difficulty and conflict. To distribute the History of science into
such Epochs, with their Preludes and Sequels, if successfully
attempted, must needs make the series and connections of its
occurrences more distinct and intelligible. Such periods form
resting-places, where we pause till the dust of the confused march is
laid, and the prospect of the path is clear.</p>
<p><i>Inductive Charts</i>.<a id="fnanchor5-1" href="#note5-1"><span
class="fnanchor">5</span></a>&#8212;Since the advance of science
consists in collecting by induction true general laws from particular
facts, and in combining several such laws into one higher
generalization, in which they still retain their truth; we might form
a Chart, or Table, of the progress of each science, by setting down
the particular facts which have thus been combined, so as to form
general truths, and by marking the further union of these general
truths into others more comprehensive. The Table of the progress of
any science would thus resemble the Map of a River, in which the
waters from separate sources unite and make rivulets, which again meet
with rivulets from other fountains, and thus go on forming by their
junction trunks of a higher and higher order. The representation of
the state of a science in this form, would necessarily exhibit all the
principal doctrines of the science; for each general truth contains
the particular truths from which it was derived, and may be followed
backwards till we have these before us in their separate state. And
the last and most advanced generalization would have, in such a
scheme, its proper place and the evidence of its validity. Hence such
an <i>Inductive Table</i> of each science would afford a criterion of
the correctness of our distribution of the inductive Epochs, by its
coincidence with the views of the best judges, as to the substantial
contents of the science in question. By forming, therefore, such
Inductive Tables of the principal sciences of which I have here to
speak, and by regulating by these tables, my views of the history of
the sciences, I conceive that I have secured the distribution of my
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page48">48</a></span> history from
material error; for no merely arbitrary division of the events could
satisfy such conditions. But though I have constructed such charts to
direct the course of the present history, I shall not insert them in
the work, reserving them for the illustration of the philosophy of the
subject; for to this they more properly belong, being a part of the
<i>Logic of Induction</i>.</p>

<p><i>Stationary Periods</i>.&#8212;By the lines of such maps the real
advance of science is depicted, and nothing else. But there are
several occurrences of other kinds, too interesting and too
instructive to be altogether omitted. In order to understand the
conditions of the progress of knowledge, we must attend, in some
measure, to the failures as well as the successes by which such
attempts have been attended. When we reflect during how small a
portion of the whole history of human speculations, science has really
been, in any marked degree, progressive, we must needs feel some
curiosity to know what was doing in these <em>stationary</em> periods;
what field could be found which admitted of so wide a deviation, or at
least so protracted a wandering. It is highly necessary to our
purpose, to describe the baffled enterprises as well as the
achievements of human speculation.</p>
<p><i>Deduction</i>.&#8212;During a great part of such stationary
periods, we shall find that the process which we have spoken of as
essential to the formation of real science, the conjunction of clear
Ideas with distinct Facts, was interrupted; and, in such cases, men
dealt with ideas alone. They employed themselves in reasoning from
principles, and they arranged, and classified, and analyzed their
ideas, so as to make their reasonings satisfy the requisitions of our
rational faculties. This process of drawing conclusions from our
principles, by rigorous and unimpeachable trains of demonstration, is
termed <i>Deduction</i>. In its due place, it is a highly important
part of every science; but it has no value when the fundamental
principles, on which the whole of the demonstration rests, have not
first been obtained by the induction of facts, so as to supply the
materials of substantial truth. Without such materials, a series of
demonstrations resembles physical science only as a shadow resembles a
real object. To give a real significance to our propositions,
Induction must provide what Deduction cannot supply. From a pictured
hook we can hang only a pictured chain.</p>
<p><i>Distinction of common Notions and Scientific Ideas</i>.<a
id="fnanchor6-1" href="#note6-1"><span
class="fnanchor">6</span></a>&#8212;When the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page49">49</a></span> notions with which men are conversant in
the common course of practical life, which give meaning to their
familiar language, and employment to their hourly thoughts, are
compared with the Ideas on which exact science is founded, we find
that the two classes of intellectual operations have much that is
common and much that is different. Without here attempting fully to
explain this relation (which, indeed, is one of the hardest problems
of our philosophy), we may observe that they have this in common, that
both are acquired by acts of the mind exercised in connecting external
impressions, and may be employed in conducting a train of reasoning;
or, speaking loosely (for we cannot here pursue the subject so as to
arrive at philosophical exactness), we may say, that all notions and
ideas are obtained by an <em>inductive</em>, and may be used in a
<em>deductive</em> process. But scientific Ideas and common Notions
differ in this, that the former are precise and stable, the latter
vague and variable; the former are possessed with clear insight, and
employed in a sense rigorously limited, and always identically the
same; the latter have grown up in the mind from a thousand dim and
diverse suggestions, and the obscurity and incongruity which belong to
their origin hang about all their applications. Scientific Ideas can
often be adequately exhibited for all the purposes of reasoning, by
means of Definitions and Axioms; all attempts to reason by means of
Definitions from common Notions, lead to empty forms or entire
confusion.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note6-1"
href="#fnanchor6-1">6</a></span> Scientific Ideas depend upon certain
<i>Fundamental Ideas</i>, which are enumerated in the
<i>Philosophy</i>, book i. ch. 8.</div>
<p>Such common Notions are sufficient for the common practical conduct
of human life: but man is not a practical creature merely; he has
within him a <em>speculative</em> tendency, a pleasure in the
contemplation of ideal relations, a love of knowledge as knowledge. It
is this speculative tendency which brings to light the difference of
common Notions and scientific Ideas, of which we have spoken. The mind
analyzes such Notions, reasons upon them, combines and connects them;
for it feels assured that intellectual things ought to be able to bear
such handling. Even practical knowledge, we see clearly, is not
possible without the use of the reason; and the speculative reason is
only the reason satisfying itself of its own consistency. The
speculative faculty cannot be controlled from acting. The mind cannot
but claim a right to speculate concerning all its own acts and
creations; yet, when it exercises this right upon its common practical
notions, we find that it runs into barren abstractions and
ever-recurring cycles of subtlety. Such Notions are like waters
naturally stagnant; however much we urge and agitate them, they only
revolve in stationary <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page50">50</a></span> whirlpools. But the mind is capable of
acquiring scientific Ideas, which are better fitted to undergo
discussion and impulsion. When our speculations are duly fed from the
springheads of Observation, and frequently drawn off into the region
of Applied Science, we may have a living stream of consistent and
progressive knowledge. That science may be both real as to its import,
and logical as to its form, the examples of many existing sciences
sufficiently prove.</p>
<p><i>School Philosophy</i>.&#8212;So long, however, as attempts are
made to form sciences, without such a verification and realization of
their fundamental ideas, there is, in the natural series of
speculation, no self-correcting principle. A philosophy constructed on
notions obscure, vague, and unsubstantial, and held in spite of the
want of correspondence between its doctrines and the actual train of
physical events, may long subsist, and occupy men’s minds. Such a
philosophy must depend for its permanence upon the pleasure which men
feel in tracing the operations of their own and other men’s minds, and
in reducing them to logical consistency and systematical
arrangement.</p>
<p>In these cases the main subjects of attention are not external
objects, but speculations previously delivered; the object is not to
interpret nature, but man’s mind. The opinions of the Masters are the
facts which the Disciples endeavor to reduce to unity, or to follow
into consequences. A series of speculators who pursue such a course,
may properly be termed a <i>School</i>, and their philosophy a
<i>School Philosophy</i>; whether their agreement in such a mode of
seeking knowledge arise from personal communication and tradition, or
be merely the result of a community of intellectual character and
propensity. The two great periods of School Philosophy (it will be
recollected that we are here directing our attention mainly to
physical science) were that of the Greeks and that of the Middle
Ages;&#8212;the period of the first waking of science, and that of its
midday slumber.</p>
<p>What has been said thus briefly and imperfectly, would require
great detail and much explanation, to give it its full significance
and authority. But it seemed proper to state so much in this place, in
order to render more intelligible and more instructive, at the first
aspect, the view of the attempted or effected progress of science.</p>
<p>It is, perhaps, a disadvantage inevitably attending an undertaking
like the present, that it must set out with statements so abstract;
and must present them without their adequate development and proof.
Such an Introduction, both in its character and its scale of
execution, may be compared to the geographical sketch of a country,
with which <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page51">51</a></span> the
historian of its fortunes often begins his narration. So much of
Metaphysics is as necessary to us as such a portion of Geography is to
the Historian of an Empire; and what has hitherto been said, is
intended as a slight outline of the Geography of that Intellectual
World, of which we have here to study the History.</p>
<p>The name which we have given to this History&#8212;<span
class="sc">A History of the Inductive Sciences</span>&#8212;has the
fault of seeming to exclude from the rank of Inductive Sciences those
which are not included in the History; as Ethnology and Glossology,
Political Economy, Psychology. This exclusion I by no means wish to
imply; but I could find no other way of compendiously describing my
subject, which was intended to comprehend those Sciences in which, by
the observation of facts and the use of reason, systems of doctrine
have been established which are universally received as truths among
thoughtful men; and which may therefore be studied as examples of the
manner in which truth is to be discovered. Perhaps a more exact
description of the work would have been, <i>A History of the principal
Sciences hitherto established by Induction</i>. I may add that I do
not include in the phrase “Inductive Sciences,” the branches of Pure
Mathematics (Geometry, Arithmetic, Algebra, and the like), because, as
I have elsewhere stated (<i>Phil. Ind. Sc.</i>, book ii. c. 1), these
are not <em>Inductive</em> but <em>Deductive</em> Sciences. They do
not infer true theories from observed facts, and more general from
more limited laws: but they trace the conditions of all theory, the
properties of space and number; and deduce results from ideas without
the aid of experience. The History of these Sciences is briefly given
in Chapters 13 and 14 of the Second Book of the <i>Philosophy</i> just
referred to.</p>
<hr class="three above" />
<p>I may further add that the other work to which I refer, the
<i>Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences</i>, is in a great measure
historical, no less than the present <i>History</i>. That work
contains the history of the Sciences so far as it depends on
<i>Ideas</i>; the present work contains the history so far as it
depends upon <i>Observation</i>. The two works resulted simultaneously
from the same examination of the principal writers on science in all
ages, and may serve to supplement each other.<br /></p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Prelude to the Greek School Philosophy.</span></h3>
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>First Attempts of the
Speculative Faculty in Physical Inquiries.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">AT</span> an early period of history
there appeared in men a propensity to pursue speculative inquiries
concerning the various parts and properties of the material world.
What they saw excited them to meditate, to conjecture, and to reason:
they endeavored to account for natural events, to trace their causes,
to reduce them to their principles. This habit of mind, or, at least
that modification of it which we have here to consider, seems to have
been first unfolded among the Greeks. And during that obscure
introductory interval which elapsed while the speculative tendencies
of men were as yet hardly disentangled from the practical, those who
were most eminent in such inquiries were distinguished by the same
term of praise which is applied to sagacity in matters of action, and
were called <em>wise</em> men&#8212;σοφοὶ. But when it came to be
clearly felt by such persons that their endeavors were suggested by
the love of knowledge, a motive different from the motives which lead
to the wisdom of active life, a name was adopted of a more
appropriate, as well as of a more modest signification, and they were
termed <i>philosophers</i>, or lovers of wisdom. This appellation is
said<a id="fnanchor7-1" href="#note7-1"><span
class="fnanchor">7</span></a> to have been first assumed by
Pythagoras. Yet he, in Herodotus, instead of having this title, is
called a powerful <i>sophist</i>&#8212;Ἑλλήνων οὐ τῷ ἀσθενεστάτῳ
σοφιστῇ Πυθαγόρῃ;<a id="fnanchor8-1" href="#note8-1"><span
class="fnanchor">8</span></a> the historian using this word, as it
would seem, without intending to imply that misuse of reason which the
term afterwards came to denote. The historians of literature <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page56">56</a></span> placed Pythagoras at
the origin of the Italic School, one of the two main lines of
succession of the early Greek philosophers: but the other, the Ionic
School, which more peculiarly demands our attention, in consequence of
its character and subsequent progress, is deduced from Thales, who
preceded the age of <i>Philosophy</i>, and was one of the
<i>sophi</i>, or “wise men of Greece.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note7-1"
href="#fnanchor7-1">7</a></span> Cic. Tusc. v. 3.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note8-1"
href="#fnanchor8-1">8</a></span> Herod. iv. 95.</div>
<p>The Ionic School was succeeded in Greece by several others; and the
subjects which occupied the attention of these schools became very
extensive. In fact, the first attempts were, to form systems which
should explain the laws and causes of the material universe; and to
these were soon added all the great questions which our moral
condition and faculties suggest. The physical philosophy of these
schools is especially deserving of our study, as exhibiting the
character and fortunes of the most memorable attempt at universal
knowledge which has ever been made. It is highly instructive to trace
the principles of this undertaking; for the course pursued was
certainly one of the most natural and tempting which can be imagined;
the essay was made by a nation unequalled in fine mental endowments,
at the period of its greatest activity and vigor; and yet it must be
allowed (for, at least so far as physical science is concerned, none
will contest this), to have been entirely unsuccessful. We cannot
consider otherwise than as an utter failure, an endeavor to discover
the causes of things, of which the most complete results are the
Aristotelian physical treatises; and which, after reaching the point
which these treatises mark, left the human mind to remain stationary,
at any rate on all such subjects, for nearly two thousand years.</p>
<p>The early philosophers of Greece entered upon the work of physical
speculation in a manner which showed the vigor and confidence of the
questioning spirit, as yet untamed by labors and reverses. It was for
later ages to learn that man must acquire, slowly and patiently,
letter by letter, the alphabet in which nature writes her answers to
such inquiries. The first students wished to divine, at a single
glance, the whole import of her book. They endeavored to discover the
origin and principle of the universe; according to Thales,
<em>water</em> was the origin of all things, according to Anaximenes,
<em>air</em>; and Heraclitus considered <em>fire</em> as the essential
principle of the universe. It has been conjectured, with great
plausibility, that this tendency to give to their Philosophy the form
of a Cosmogony, was owing to the influence of the poetical Cosmogonies
and Theogonies which had been produced and admired at a still earlier
age. Indeed,  such wide and ambitious <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page57">57</a></span> doctrines as those which have been
mentioned, were better suited to the dim magnificence of poetry, than
to the purpose of a philosophy which was to bear the sharp scrutiny of
reason. When we speak of the <i>principles</i> of things, the term,
even now, is very ambiguous and indefinite in its import, but how much
more was that the case in the first attempts to use such abstractions!
The term which is commonly used in this sense (ἀρχὴ), signified at
first <i>the beginning</i>; and in its early philosophical
applications implied some obscure mixed reference to the mechanical,
chemical, organic, and historical causes of the visible state of
things, besides the theological views which at this period were only
just beginning to be separated from the physical. Hence we are not to
be surprised if the sources from which the opinions of this period
appear to be derived are rather vague suggestions and casual
analogies, than any reasons which will bear examination. Aristotle
conjectures, with considerable probability, that the doctrine of
Thales, according to which water was the universal element, resulted
from the manifest importance of moisture in the support of animal and
vegetable life.<a id="fnanchor9-1" href="#note9-1"><span
class="fnanchor">9</span></a> But such precarious analyses of these
obscure and loose dogmas of early antiquity are of small consequence
to our object.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note9-1"
href="#fnanchor9-1">9</a></span> Metaph. i. 3.</div>
<p>In more limited and more definite examples of inquiry concerning
the causes of natural appearances, and in the attempts made to satisfy
men’s curiosity in such cases, we appear to discern a more genuine
prelude to the true spirit of physical inquiry. One of the most
remarkable instances of this kind is to be found in the speculations
which Herodotus records, relative to the cause of the floods of the
Nile. “Concerning the nature of this river,” says the father of
history,<a id="fnanchor10-1" href="#note10-1"><span
class="fnanchor">10</span></a> “I was not able to learn any thing,
either from the priests or from any one besides, though I questioned
them very pressingly. For the Nile is flooded for a hundred days,
beginning with the summer solstice; and after this time it diminishes,
and is, during the whole winter, very small. And on this head I was
not able to obtain any thing satisfactory from any one of the
Egyptians, when I asked what is the power by which the Nile is in its
nature the reverse of other rivers.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note10-1"
href="#fnanchor10-1">10</a></span> Herod. ii. 19.</div>
<p>We may see, I think, in the historian’s account, that the Grecian
mind felt a craving to discover the reasons of things which other
nations did not feel. The Egyptians, it appears, had no theory, and
felt no want of a theory. Not so the Greeks; they had their reasons to
render, though they were not such as satisfied Herodotus. “Some <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page58">58</a></span> of the Greeks,” he
says, “who wish to be considered great philosophers (Ἑλλήνων τινες
ἐπισήμοι βουλόμενοι γενέσθαι σοφίην), have propounded three ways of
accounting for these floods. Two of them,” he adds, “I do not think
worthy of record, except just so far as to mention them.” But as these
are some of the earliest Greek essays in physical philosophy, it will
be worth while, even at this day, to preserve the brief notice he has
given of them, and his own reasonings upon the same subject.</p>
<p>“One of these opinions holds that the Etesian winds [which blew
from the north] are the cause of these floods, by preventing the Nile
from flowing into the sea.” Against this the historian reasons very
simply and sensibly. “Very often when the Etesian winds do not blow,
the Nile is flooded nevertheless. And moreover, if the Etesian winds
were the cause, all other rivers, which have their course opposite to
these winds, ought to undergo the same changes as the Nile; which the
rivers of Syria and Libya so circumstanced do not.”</p>
<p>“The next opinion is still more unscientific (ἀνεπιστημονεστέρη),
and is, in truth, marvellous for its folly. This holds that the ocean
flows all round the earth, and that the Nile comes out of the ocean,
and by that means produces its effects.” “Now,” says the historian,
“the man who talks about this ocean-river, goes into the region of
fable, where it is not easy to demonstrate that he is wrong. I know of
no such river. But I suppose that Homer and some of the earlier poets
invented this fiction and introduced it into their poetry.”</p>
<p>He then proceeds to a third account, which to a modern reasoner
would appear not at all unphilosophical in itself, but which he,
nevertheless, rejects in a manner no less decided than the others.
“The third opinion, though much the most plausible, is still more
wrong than the others; for it asserts an impossibility, namely, that
the Nile proceeds from the melting of the snow. Now the Nile flows out
of Libya, and through Ethiopia, which are very hot countries, and thus
comes into Egypt, which is a colder region. How then can it proceed
from snow?” He then offers several other reasons “to show,” as he
says, “to any one capable of reasoning on such subjects (ἀνδρί γε
λογίζεσθαι τοιούτων πέρι οἵῳ τε ἔοντι), that the assertion cannot be
true. The winds which blow from the southern regions are hot; the
inhabitants are black; the swallows and kites (ἰκτῖνοι) stay in the
country the whole year; the cranes fly the colds of Scythia, and seek
their warm winter-quarters there; which would not be if it snowed ever
so little.” He adds another reason, founded apparently upon <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page59">59</a></span> some limited empirical
maxim of weather-wisdom taken from the climate of Greece. “Libya,” he
said, “has neither rain nor ice, and therefore no snow; <i>for</i>, in
five days after a fall of snow there must be a fall of rain; so that
if it snowed in those regions it must rain too.” I need not observe
that Herodotus was not aware of the difference between the climate of
high mountains and plains in a torrid region; but it is impossible not
to be struck both with the activity and the coherency of thought
displayed by the Greek mind in this primitive physical inquiry.</p>
<p>But I must not omit the hypothesis which Herodotus himself
proposes, after rejecting those which have been already given. It does
not appear to me easy to catch his exact meaning, but the statement
will still be curious. “If,” he says, “one who has condemned opinions
previously promulgated may put forward his own opinion concerning so
obscure a matter, I will state why it seems to me that the Nile is
flooded in summer.” This opinion he propounds at first with an
oracular brevity, which it is difficult to suppose that he did not
intend to be impressive. “In winter the sun is carried by the seasons
away from his former course, and goes to the upper parts of Libya. And
<em>there, in short, is the whole account;</em> for that region to
which this divinity (the sun) is nearest, must naturally be most scant
of water, and the river-sources of that country must be dried up.”</p>
<p>But the lively and garrulous Ionian immediately relaxes from this
apparent reserve. “To explain the matter more at length,” he proceeds,
“it is thus. The sun when he traverses the upper parts of Libya, does
what he commonly does in summer;&#8212;he <em>draws</em> the water to
him (ἕλκει ἐπ’ ἑωϋτὸν τὸ ὕδωρ), and having thus drawn it, he pushes it
to the upper regions (of the air probably), and then the winds take it
and disperse it till they dissolve in moisture. And thus the winds
which blow from those countries, Libs and Notus, are the most moist of
all winds. Now when the winter relaxes and the sun returns to the
north, he still draws water from all the rivers, but they are
increased by showers and rain torrents so that they are in flood till
the summer comes; and then, the rain falling and the sun still drawing
them, they become small. But the Nile, not being fed by rains, yet
being drawn by the sun, is, alone of all rivers, much more scanty in
the winter than in the summer. For in summer it is drawn like all
other rivers, but in winter it alone has its supplies shut up. And in
this way, I have been led to think the sun is the cause of the
occurrence in question.” We may remark that the historian here appears
to <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page60">60</a></span> ascribe the
inequality of the Nile at different seasons to the influence of the
sun upon its springs alone, the other cause of change, the rains being
here excluded; and that, on this supposition, the same relative
effects would be produced whether the sun increase the sources in
winter by melting the snows, or diminish them in summer by what he
calls <i>drawing</i> them upwards.</p>
<p>This specimen of the early efforts of the Greeks in physical
speculations, appears to me to speak strongly for the opinion that
their philosophy on such subjects was the native growth of the Greek
mind, and owed nothing to the supposed lore of Egypt and the East; an
opinion which has been adopted with regard to the Greek Philosophy in
general by the most competent judges on a full survey of the
evidence.<a id="fnanchor11-1" href="#note11-1"><span
class="fnanchor">11</span></a> Indeed, we have no evidence whatever
that, at any period, the African or Asiatic nations (with the
exception perhaps of the Indians) ever felt this importunate curiosity
with regard to the definite application of the idea of cause and
effect to visible phenomena; or drew so strong a line between a
fabulous legend and a reason rendered; or attempted to ascend to a
natural cause by classing together phenomena of the same kind. We may
be well excused, therefore, for believing that they could not impart
to the Greeks what they themselves did not possess; and so far as our
survey goes, physical philosophy has its origin, apparently
spontaneous and independent, in the active and acute intellect of
Greece.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Primitive Mistake in Greek Physical
Philosophy.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">We</span> now proceed to examine with what success
the Greeks followed the track into which they had thus struck. And
here we are obliged to confess that they very soon turned aside from
the right road to truth, and deviated into a vast field of error, in
which they and their successors have wandered almost to the present
time. It is not necessary here to inquire why those faculties which
appear to be bestowed upon us for the discovery of truth, were
permitted by Providence to fail so signally in answering that purpose;
whether, like the powers by which we seek our happiness, they involve
a responsibility on our part, and may be defeated by rejecting the
guidance of a higher faculty; or whether these endowments, though they
did not <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page61">61</a></span>
immediately lead man to profound physical knowledge, answered some
nobler and better purpose in his constitution and government. The fact
undoubtedly was, that the physical philosophy of the Greeks soon
became trifling and worthless; and it is proper to point out, as
precisely as we can, in what the fundamental mistake consisted.</p>
<p>To explain this, we may in the first place return for a moment to
Herodotus’s account of the cause of the floods of the Nile.</p>
<p>The reader will probably have observed a remarkable phrase used by
Herodotus, in his own explanation of these inundations. He says that
the sun <i>draws</i>, or attracts, the water; a metaphorical term,
obviously intended to denote some more general and abstract conception
than that of the visible operation which the word primarily signifies.
This abstract notion of “drawing” is, in the historian, as we see,
very vague and loose; it might, with equal propriety, be explained to
mean what we now understand by mechanical or by chemical attraction,
or pressure, or evaporation. And in like manner, all the first
attempts to comprehend the operations of nature, led to the
introduction of abstract conceptions, often vague, indeed, but not,
therefore, unmeaning; such as <i>motion</i> and <i>velocity</i>,
<i>force</i> and <i>pressure</i>, <i>impetus</i> and <i>momentum</i>
(ῥοπὴ). And the next step in philosophizing, necessarily was to
endeavor to make these vague abstractions more clear and fixed, so
that the logical faculty should be able to employ them securely and
coherently. But there were two ways of making this attempt; the one,
by examining the words only, and the thoughts which they call up; the
other, by attending to the facts and things which bring these abstract
terms into use. The latter, the method of <em>real</em> inquiry, was
the way to success; but the Greeks followed the former, the
<em>verbal</em> or <em>notional</em> course, and failed.</p>
<p>If Herodotus, when the notion of the sun’s attracting the waters of
rivers had entered into his mind, had gone on to instruct himself, by
attention to facts, in what manner this notion could be made more
definite, while it still remained applicable to all the knowledge
which could be obtained, he would have made some progress towards a
true solution of his problem. If, for instance, he had tried to
ascertain whether this Attraction which the sun exerted upon the
waters of rivers, depended on his influence at their fountains only,
or was exerted over their whole course, and over waters which were not
parts of rivers, he would have been led to reject his hypothesis; for
he would have found, by observations sufficiently obvious, that the
sun’s Attraction, as shown in such cases, is a tendency to lessen all
expanded and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page62">62</a></span> open
collections of moisture, whether flowing from a spring or not; and it
would then be seen that this influence, operating on the whole surface
of the Nile, must diminish it as well as other rivers, in summer, and
therefore could not be the cause of its overflow. He would thus have
corrected his first loose conjecture by a real study of nature, and
might, in the course of his meditations, have been led to available
notions of Evaporation, or other natural actions. And, in like manner,
in other cases, the rude attempts at explanation, which the first
exercise of the speculative faculty produced, might have been
gradually concentrated and refined, so as to fall in, both with the
requisitions of reason and the testimony of sense.</p>
<p>But this was not the direction which the Greek speculators took. On
the contrary; as soon as they had introduced into their philosophy any
abstract and general conceptions, they proceeded to scrutinize these
by the internal light of the mind alone, without any longer looking
abroad into the world of sense. They took for granted that philosophy
must result from the relations of those notions which are involved in
the common use of language, and they proceeded to seek their
philosophical doctrines by studying such notions. They ought to have
reformed and fixed their usual conceptions by Observation; they only
analyzed and expanded them by Reflection: they ought to have sought by
trial, among the Notions which passed through their minds, some one
which admitted of exact application to Facts; they selected
arbitrarily, and, consequently, erroneously, the Notions according to
which Facts should be assembled and arranged: they ought to have
collected clear Fundamental Ideas from the world of things by
<em>inductive</em> acts of thought; they only derived results by
<em>Deduction</em> from one or other of their familiar Conceptions.<a

<span class="sc">The Greek School Philosophy.</span></h3>
<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>The general Foundation of
the Greek School Philosophy.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> physical philosophy of the
Greek Schools was formed by looking at the material world through the
medium of that common language which men employ to answer the common
occasions of life; and by adopting, arbitrarily, as the grounds of
comparison of facts, and of inference from them, notions more abstract
and large than those with which men are practically familiar, but not
less vague and obscure. Such a philosophy, however much it might be
systematized, by classifying and analyzing the conceptions which it
involves, could not overcome the vices of its fundamental principle.
But before speaking of these defects, we must give some indications of
its character.</p>
<p>The propensity to seek for principles in the common usages of
language may be discerned at a very early period. Thus we have an
example of it in a saying which is reported of Thales, the founder of
Greek philosophy.<a id="fnanchor13-1" href="#note13-1"><span
class="fnanchor">13</span></a> When he was asked, “What is the
<em>greatest</em> thing?” he replied, “<em>Place</em>; for all other
things are <em>in</em> the world, but the world is <em>in</em> it.” In
Aristotle we have the consummation of this mode of speculation. The
usual point from which he starts in his inquiries is, that we say thus
or thus in common language. Thus, when he has to discuss the question,
whether there be, in any part of the universe, a Void, or space in
which there is nothing, he inquires first in how many senses we say
that one thing is <em>in</em> another. He enumerates many of these;<a
id="fnanchor14-1" href="#note14-1"><span
class="fnanchor">14</span></a> we say the part is in the whole, as the
finger is <em>in</em> the hand; again we say, the species is in the
genus, as man is included <em>in</em> animal; again, the government of
Greece is <em>in</em> the king; and various other senses are described
or exemplified, but of all these <em>the most proper</em> is when we
say a thing is <em>in</em> a vessel, and generally, <em>in place</em>.
He next examines what <em>place</em> is, and comes to this conclusion,
that “if about a body there be another body including it, it is in
place, and if not, not.” A body <em>moves</em> when it changes its
place; but <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page64">64</a></span> he
adds, that if water be in a vessel, the vessel being at rest, the
parts of the water may still move, for they are included by each
other; so that while the whole does not change its place, the parts
may change their places in a circular order. Proceeding then to the
question of a <em>void</em>, he, as usual, examines the different
senses in which the term is used, and adopts, as the most proper,
<i>place without matter</i>; with no useful result, as we shall <a
href="#void">soon</a> see.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note13-1"

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note14-1"

<p>Again,<a id="fnanchor15-1" href="#note15-1"><span
class="fnanchor">15</span></a> in a question concerning mechanical
action, he says, “When a man moves a stone by pushing it with a stick,
<em>we say</em> both that the man moves the stone, and that the stick
moves the stone, but the latter <em>more properly</em>.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note15-1"
href="#fnanchor15-1">15</a></span> Physic. Ausc. viii. 5.</div>
<p>Again, we find the Greek philosophers applying themselves to
extract their dogmas from the most general and abstract notions which
they could detect; for example,&#8212;from the conception of the
Universe as One or as Many things. They tried to determine how far we
may, or must, combine with these conceptions that of a whole, of
parts, of number, of limits, of place, of beginning or end, of full or
void, of rest or motion, of cause and effect, and the like. The
analysis of such conceptions with such a view, occupies, for instance,
almost the whole of Aristotle’s <i>Treatise on the Heavens</i>.</p>
<p>The Dialogue of Plato, which is entitled <i>Parmenides</i>, appears
at first as if its object were to show the futility of this method of
philosophizing; for the philosopher whose name it bears, is
represented as arguing with an Athenian named Aristotle,<a
id="fnanchor16-1" href="#note16-1"><span
class="fnanchor">16</span></a> and, by a process of metaphysical
analysis, reducing him at least to this conclusion, “that whether
<em>One</em> exist, or do not exist, it follows that both it and other
things, with reference to themselves and to each other, all and in all
respects, both are and are not, both appear and appear not.” Yet the
method of Plato, so far as concerns truths of that kind with which we
are here concerned, was little more efficacious than that of his
rival. It consists mainly, as may be seen in several of the dialogues,
and especially in the <i>Timæus</i>, in the application of notions as
loose as those of the Peripatetics; for example, the conceptions of
the Good, the Beautiful, the Perfect; and these are rendered still
more arbitrary, by assuming an acquaintance with the views of the
Creator of the universe. The philosopher is thus led to maxims which
agree with those <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page65">65</a></span>
of the Aristotelians, that there can be no void, that things seek
their own place, and the like.<a id="fnanchor17-1"
href="#note17-1"><span class="fnanchor">17</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note16-1"
href="#fnanchor16-1">16</a></span> This Aristotle is not the
Stagirite, who was forty-five years younger than Plato, but one of the
“thirty tyrants,” as they were called.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note17-1"
href="#fnanchor17-1">17</a></span> Timæus, p. 80.</div>
<p>Another mode of reasoning, very widely applied in these attempts,
was the doctrine of contrarieties, in which it was assumed, that
adjectives or substantives which are in common language, or in some
abstract mode of conception, opposed to each other, must point at some
fundamental antithesis in nature, which it is important to study. Thus
Aristotle<a id="fnanchor18-1" href="#note18-1"><span
class="fnanchor">18</span></a> says, that the Pythagoreans, from the
contrasts which number suggests, collected ten
principles,&#8212;Limited and Unlimited, Odd and Even, One and Many,
Right and Left, Male and Female, Rest and Motion, Straight and Curved,
Light and Darkness, Good and Evil, Square and Oblong. We shall see
hereafter, that Aristotle himself deduced the doctrine of Four
Elements, and other dogmas, by oppositions of the same kind.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note18-1"
href="#fnanchor18-1">18</a></span> Metaph. 1. 5.</div>
<p>The physical speculator of the present day will learn without
surprise, that such a mode of discussion as this, led to no truths of
real or permanent value. The whole mass of the Greek philosophy,
therefore, shrinks into an almost imperceptible compass, when viewed
with reference to the progress of physical knowledge. Still the
general character of this system, and its fortunes from the time of
its founders to the overthrow of their authority, are not without
their instruction, and, it may be hoped, not without their interest. I
proceed, therefore, to give some account of these doctrines in their
most fully developed and permanently received form, that in which they
were presented by Aristotle.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>The Aristotelian Physical
Philosophy.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> principal physical treatises of
Aristotle are, the eight Books of “Physical Lectures,” the four Books
“Of the Heavens,” the two Books “Of Production and Destruction:” for
the Book “Of the World” is now universally acknowledged to be
spurious; and the “Meteorologies,” though full of physical
explanations of natural phenomena, does not exhibit the doctrines and
reasonings of the school in so general a form; the same may be said of
the “Mechanical Problems.” The treatises on the various subjects of
Natural History, “On Animals,” “On the Parts of Animals,” “On Plants,”
“On Physiognomonics,” “On Colors,” “On Sound,” contain an
extraordinary <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page66">66</a></span>
accumulation of facts, and manifest a wonderful power of
systematizing; but are not works which expound principles, and
therefore do not require to be here considered.</p>
<p>The Physical Lectures are possibly the work concerning which a
well-known anecdote is related by Simplicius, a Greek commentator of
the sixth century, as well as by Plutarch. It is said, that Alexander
the Great wrote to his former tutor to this effect; “You have not done
well in publishing these lectures; for how shall we, your pupils,
excel other men, if you make that public to all, which we learnt from
you?” To this Aristotle is said to have replied: “My Lectures are
published and not published; they will be intelligible to those who
heard them, and to none besides.” This may very easily be a story
invented and circulated among those who found the work beyond their
comprehension; and it cannot be denied, that to make out the meaning
and reasoning of every part, would be a task very laborious and
difficult, if not impossible. But we may follow the import of a large
portion of the Physical Lectures with sufficient clearness to
apprehend the character and principles of the reasoning; and this is
what I shall endeavor to do.</p>
<p>The author’s introductory statement of his view of the nature of
philosophy falls in very closely with what has been said, that he
takes his facts and generalizations as they are implied in the
structure of language. “We must in all cases proceed,” he says, “from
what is known to what is unknown.” This will not be denied; but we can
hardly follow him in his inference. He adds, “We must proceed,
therefore, from universal to particular. And something of this,” he
pursues, “may be seen in language; for names signify things in a
general and indefinite manner, as <i>circle</i>, and by defining we
unfold them into particulars.” He illustrates this by saying, “thus
children at first call all men <i>father</i>, and all women
<i>mother</i>, but afterwards distinguish.”</p>
<p id="void">In accordance with this view, he endeavors to settle
several of the great questions concerning the universe, which had been
started among subtle and speculative men, by unfolding the meaning of
the words and phrases which are applied to the most general notions of
things and relations. We have already noticed this method. A few
examples will illustrate it further:&#8212;Whether there was or was
not a <i>void</i>, or place without matter, had already been debated
among rival sects of philosophers. The antagonist arguments were
briefly these:&#8212;There must be a void, because a body cannot move
into a space except it is <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page67">67</a></span> empty, and therefore without a void there
could be no motion:&#8212;and, on the other hand, there is no void,
for the intervals between bodies are filled with air, and air is
something. These opinions had even been supported by reference to
experiment. On the one hand, Anaxagoras and his school had shown, that
air, when confined, resisted compression, by squeezing a blown
bladder, and pressing down an inverted vessel in the water; on the
other hand, it was alleged that a vessel full of fine ashes held as
much water as if the ashes were not there, which could only be
explained by supposing void spaces among the ashes. Aristotle decides
that there is no void, on such arguments as this:<a id="fnanchor19-1"
href="#note19-1"><span class="fnanchor">19</span></a>&#8212;In a void
there could be no difference of up and down; for as in nothing there
are no differences, so there are none in a privation or negation; but
a void is merely a privation or negation of matter; therefore, in a
void, bodies could not move up and down, which it is in their nature
to do. It is easily seen that such a mode of reasoning, elevates the
familiar forms of language and the intellectual connections of terms,
to a supremacy over facts; making truth depend upon whether terms are
or are not privative, and whether we say that bodies fall
<i>naturally</i>. In such a philosophy every new result of observation
would be compelled to conform to the usual combinations of phrases, as
these had become associated by the modes of apprehension previously
familiar.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note19-1"
href="#fnanchor19-1">19</a></span> Physic. Ausc. iv. 7, p. 215.</div>
<p>It is not intended here to intimate that the common modes of
apprehension, which are the basis of common language, are limited and
casual. They imply, on the contrary, universal and necessary
conditions of our perceptions and conceptions; thus all things are
necessarily apprehended as existing in Time and Space, and as
connected by relations of Cause and Effect; and so far as the
Aristotelian philosophy reasons from these assumptions, it has a real
foundation, though even in this case the conclusions are often
insecure. We have an example of this reasoning in the eighth Book,<a
id="fnanchor20-1" href="#note20-1"><span
class="fnanchor">20</span></a> where he proves that there never was a
time in which change and motion did not exist; “For if all things were
at rest, the first motion must have been produced by some change in
some of these things; that is, there must have been a change before
the first change;” and again, “How can <i>before</i> and <i>after</i>
apply when time is not? or how can time be when motion is not? If,” he
adds, “time is a numeration of motion, and if time be eternal, motion
must be eternal.” But he sometimes <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page68">68</a></span> introduces principles of a more arbitrary
character; and besides the general relations of thought, takes for
granted the inventions of previous speculators; such, for instance, as
the then commonly received opinions concerning the frame of the world.
From the assertion that motion is eternal, proved in the manner just
stated, Aristotle proceeds by a curious train of reasoning, to
identify this eternal motion with the diurnal motion of the heavens.
“There must,” he says, “be something which is the First Mover:”<a
id="fnanchor21-1" href="#note21-1"><span
class="fnanchor">21</span></a> this follows from the relation of
causes and effects. Again, “Motion must go on constantly, and,
therefore, must be either continuous or successive. Now what is
continuous is more properly said to take place <i>constantly</i>, than
what is successive. Also the continuous is better; but we always
suppose that which is better to take place in nature, if it be
possible. The motion of the First Mover will, therefore, be
continuous, if such an eternal motion be possible.” We here see the
vague judgment of <i>better</i> and <i>worse</i> introduced, as that
of <i>natural</i> and <i>unnatural</i> was before, into physical
reasonings.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note20-1"
href="#fnanchor20-1">20</a></span> Ib. viii. 1, p. 258.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note21-1"
href="#fnanchor21-1">21</a></span> Physic. Ausc. viii. 6. p.
258.</div>
<p>I proceed with Aristotle’s argument.<a id="fnanchor22-1"
href="#note22-1"><span class="fnanchor">22</span></a> “We have now,
therefore, to show that there may be an infinite single, continuous
motion, and that this is circular.” This is, in fact, proved, as may
readily be conceived, from the consideration that a body may go on
perpetually revolving uniformly in a circle. And thus we have a
demonstration, on the principles of this philosophy, that there is and
must be a First Mover, revolving eternally with a uniform circular
motion.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note22-1"
href="#fnanchor22-1">22</a></span> Ib. viii. 8.</div>
<p>Though this kind of philosophy may appear too trifling to deserve
being dwelt upon, it is important for our purpose so far as to
exemplify it, that we may afterwards advance, confident that we have
done it no injustice.</p>
<p>I will now pass from the doctrines relating to the motions of the
heavens, to those which concern the material elements of the universe.
And here it may be remarked that the tendency (of which we are here
tracing the development) to extract speculative opinions from the
relations of words, must be very natural to man; for the very widely
accepted doctrine of the Four Elements which appears to be founded on
the opposition of the adjectives <i>hot</i> and <i>cold</i>,
<i>wet</i> and <i>dry</i>, is much older than Aristotle, and was
probably one of the earliest of philosophical dogmas. The great master
of this philosophy, however, puts the opinion in a more systematic
manner than his predecessors. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page69">69</a></span></p>
<p>“We seek,” he says,<a id="fnanchor23-1" href="#note23-1"><span
class="fnanchor">23</span></a> “the principles of sensible things,
that is, of tangible bodies. We must take, therefore, not all the
contrarieties of quality, but those only which have reference to the
touch. Thus black and white, sweet and bitter, do not differ as
tangible qualities, and therefore must be rejected from our
consideration.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note23-1"
href="#fnanchor23-1">23</a></span> De Gen. et Corrupt. ii. 2.</div>
<p>“Now the contrarieties of quality which refer to the touch are
these: hot, cold; dry, wet; heavy, light; hard, soft; unctuous,
meagre; rough, smooth; dense, rare.” He then proceeds to reject all
but the four first of these, for various reasons; heavy and light,
because they are not active and passive qualities; the others, because
they are combinations of the four first, which therefore he infers to
be the four elementary qualities.</p>
<p>“<a id="fnanchor24-1" href="#note24-1"><span
class="fnanchor">24</span></a>Now in four things there are six
combinations of two; but the combinations of two opposites, as hot and
cold, must be rejected; we have, therefore, four elementary
combinations, which agree with the four apparently elementary bodies.
Fire is hot and dry; air is hot and wet (for steam is air); water is
cold and wet, earth is cold and dry.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note24-1"
href="#fnanchor24-1">24</a></span> Ib. iii. 8.</div>
<p>It may be remarked that this disposition to assume that some common
elementary quality must exist in the cases in which we habitually
apply a common adjective, as it began before the reign of the
Aristotelian philosophy, so also survived its influence. Not to
mention other cases, it would be difficult to free Bacon’s
<i>Inquisitio in naturam calidi</i>, “Examination of the nature of
heat,” from the charge of confounding together very different classes
of phenomena under the cover of the word <i>hot</i>.</p>
<p>The correction of these opinions concerning the elementary
composition of bodies belongs to an advanced period in the history of
physical knowledge, even after the revival of its progress. But there
are some of the Aristotelian doctrines which particularly deserve our
attention, from the prominent share they had in the very first
beginnings of that revival; I mean the doctrines concerning
motion.</p>
<p>These are still founded upon the same mode of reasoning from
adjectives; but in this case, the result follows, not only from the
opposition of the words, but also from the distinction of their being
<i>absolutely</i> or <i>relatively</i> true. “Former writers,” says
Aristotle, “have considered heavy and light <em>relatively</em> only,
taking cases, where both things have weight, but one is lighter than
the other; and they imagined that, in <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page70">70</a></span> this way, they defined what was
<em>absolutely</em> (ἁπλῶς) heavy and light.” We now know that things
which rise by their lightness do so only because they are pressed
upwards by heavier surrounding bodies; and this assumption of absolute
levity, which is evidently gratuitous, or rather merely nominal,
entirely vitiated the whole of the succeeding reasoning. The inference
was, that fire must be absolutely light, since it tends to take its
place above the other three elements; earth absolutely heavy, since it
tends to take its place below fire, air, and water. The philosopher
argued also, with great acuteness, that air, which tends to take its
place below fire and above water, must do so <em>by its nature</em>,
and not in virtue of any combination of heavy and light elements. “For
if air were composed of the parts which give fire its levity, joined
with other parts which produce gravity, we might assume a quantity of
air so large, that it should be lighter than a small quantity of fire,
having more of the light parts.” It thus follows that each of the four
elements tends to its own place, fire being the highest, air the next,
water the next, and earth the lowest.</p>
<p>The whole of this train of errors arises from fallacies which have
a verbal origin;&#8212;from considering light as opposite to heavy;
and from considering levity as a quality of a body, instead of
regarding it as the effect of surrounding bodies.</p>
<p>It is worth while to notice that a difficulty which often
embarrasses persons on their entrance upon physical
speculations,&#8212;the difficulty of conceiving that up and down are
different directions in different places,&#8212;had been completely
got over by Aristotle and the Greek philosophers. They were steadily
convinced of the roundness of the earth, and saw that this truth led
to the conclusion that all heavy bodies tend in converging directions
to the centre. And, they added, as the heavy tends to the centre, the
light tends to the exterior, “for Exterior is opposite to Centre as
heavy is to light.”<a id="fnanchor25-1" href="#note25-1"><span
class="fnanchor">25</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note25-1"
href="#fnanchor25-1">25</a></span> De Cœlo, iv. 4.</div>
<p>The tendencies of bodies downwards and upwards, their weight, their
fall, their floating or sinking, were thus accounted for in a manner
which, however unsound, satisfied the greater part of the speculative
world till the time of Galileo and Stevinus, though Archimedes in the
mean time published the true theory of floating bodies, which is very
different from that above stated. Other parts of the doctrines of
motion were delivered by the Stagirite in the same spirit and with the
same success. The motion of a body which is thrown along the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page71">71</a></span> ground diminishes and
finally ceases; the motion of a body which falls from a height goes on
becoming quicker and quicker; this was accounted for on the usual
principle of opposition, by saying that the former is a
<i>violent</i>, the latter a <i>natural</i> motion. And the later

<p>It appears to have been considered by Aristotle a difficult problem
to explain why a stone thrown from the hand continues to move for some
time, and then stops. If the hand was the cause of the motion, how
could the stone move at all when left to itself? if not, why does it
ever stop? And he answers this difficulty by saying,<a
id="fnanchor27-1" href="#note27-1"><span
class="fnanchor">27</span></a> “that there is a motion communicated to
the air, the successive parts of which urge the stone onwards; and
that each part of this medium continues to act for some while after it
has been acted on, and the motion ceases when it comes to a particle
which cannot act after it has ceased to be acted on.” It will be
readily seen that the whole of this difficulty, concerning a body
which moves forward and is retarded till it stops, arises from
ascribing the retardation, not to the real cause, the surrounding
resistances, but to the body itself.</p>

<p>One of the doctrines which was the subject of the warmest
discussion between the defenders and opposers of Aristotle, at the
revival of physical knowledge, was that in which he asserts,<a
id="fnanchor28-1" href="#note28-1"><span
class="fnanchor">28</span></a> “That body is heavier than another
which in an equal bulk moves downward quicker.” The opinion maintained
by the <span class="correction" title="emended from
Arisotelians">Aristotelians</span> at the time of Galileo was, that
bodies fall quicker exactly in proportion to their weight. The master
himself asserts this in express terms, and reasons upon it.<a
id="fnanchor29-1" href="#note29-1"><span
class="fnanchor">29</span></a> Yet in another passage he appears to
distinguish between weight and actual motion downwards.<a
id="fnanchor30-1" href="#note30-1"><span
class="fnanchor">30</span></a> “In physics, we call bodies heavy and
light from their <i>power</i> of motion; but these names are not
applied to their actual operations (ἐνέργειαις) except any one thinks
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page72">72</a></span> <i>momentum</i>
(ῥοπὴ) to be a word of both applications. But heavy and light are, as
it were, the <i>embers</i> or <i>sparks</i> of motion, and therefore
proper to be treated of here.”</p>

<p>The distinction just alluded to, between Power or Faculty of
Action, and actual Operation or Energy, is one very frequently
referred to by Aristotle; and though not by any means useless, may
easily be so used as to lead to mere verbal refinements instead of
substantial knowledge.</p>
<p>The Aristotelian distinction of Causes has not any very immediate
bearing upon the parts of physics of which we have here mainly spoken;
but it was so extensively accepted, and so long retained, that it may
be proper to notice it.<a id="fnanchor31-1" href="#note31-1"><span
class="fnanchor">31</span></a> “One kind of Cause is the matter of
which any thing is made, as bronze of a statue, and silver of a vial;
another is the form and pattern, as the Cause of an octave is the
ratio of two to one; again, there is the Cause which is the origin of
the production, as the father of the child; and again, there is the
End, or that for the sake of which any thing is done, as health is the
cause of walking.” These four kinds of Cause, the <i>material</i>, the
<i>formal</i>, the <i>efficient</i>, and the <i>final</i>, were long
leading points in all speculative inquiries; and our familiar forms of
speech still retain traces of the influence of this division.</p>

<p>It is my object here to present to the reader in an intelligible
shape, the principles and mode of reasoning of the Aristotelian
philosophy, not its results. If this were not the case, it would be
easy to excite a smile by insulating some of the passages which are
most remote from modern notions. I will only mention, as specimens,
two such passages, both very remarkable.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the book “On the Heavens,” he proves<a
id="fnanchor32-1" href="#note32-1"><span
class="fnanchor">32</span></a> the world to be <em>perfect</em>, by
reasoning of the following kind: “The bodies of which the world is
composed are solids, and therefore have three dimensions: now three is
the most perfect number; it is the first of numbers, for of <i>one</i>
we do not speak as a number; of <i>two</i> we say <i>both</i>; but
<i>three</i> is the first number of which we say <i>all</i>; moreover,
it has a beginning, a middle, and an end.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note32-1"
href="#fnanchor32-1">32</a></span> De Cœlo, i. 1.</div>
<p>The reader will still perceive the verbal foundations of opinions
thus supported.</p>
<p>“The simple elements must have simple motions, and thus fire and
air have their natural motions upwards, and water and earth have <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page73">73</a></span> their natural motions
downwards; but besides these motions, there is motion in a circle,
which is unnatural to these elements, but which is a more perfect
motion than the other, because a circle is a perfect line, and a
straight line is not; and there must be something to which this motion
is natural. From this it is evident,” he adds, with obvious animation,
“that there is some essence of body different from those of the four
elements, more divine than those, and superior to them. If things
which move in a circle move contrary to nature, it is marvellous, or
rather absurd, that this, the unnatural motion, should alone be
continuous and eternal; for unnatural motions decay speedily. And so,
from all this, we must collect, that besides the four elements which
we have here and about us, there is another removed far off, and the
more excellent in proportion as it is more distant from us.” This
fifth element was the “<i>quinta essentia</i>,” of after writers, of
which we have a trace in our modern literature, in the word
<i>quintessence</i>.</p>
<h4 id="b1-2-3"><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Technical Forms of the Greek
Schools.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">We</span> have hitherto considered only the
principle of the Greek Physics; which was, as we have seen, to deduce
its doctrines by an analysis of the notions which common language
involves. But though the Grecian philosopher began by studying words
in their common meanings, he soon found himself led to fix upon some
special shades or applications of these meanings as the permanent and
standard notion, which they were to express; that is, he made his
language <i>technical</i>. The invention and establishment of
technical terms is an important step in any philosophy, true or false;
we must, therefore, say a few words on this process, as exemplified in
the ancient systems.</p>
<p>1. <i>Technical Forms of the Aristotelian Philosophy.</i>&#8212;We
have already had occasion to cite some of the distinctions introduced
by Aristotle, which may be considered as technical; for instance, the
classification of Causes as <i>material</i>, <i>formal</i>,
<i>efficient</i>, and <i>final</i>; and the opposition of Qualities as
<i>absolute</i> and <i>relative</i>. A few more of the most important
examples may suffice. An analysis of objects into <i>Matter</i> and
<i>Form</i>, when metaphorically extended from visible objects to
things conceived in the most general manner, became an habitual
hypothesis of the Aristotelian school. Indeed this metaphor is even
yet one of the most significant of those which we can employ, to
suggest one of the most comprehensive and fundamental antitheses with
which philosophy has to do;&#8212;the opposition of sense and reason,
of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page74">74</a></span> impressions
and laws. In this application, the German philosophers have, up to the
present time, rested upon this distinction a great part of the weight
of their systems; as when Kant says, that Space and Time are the
<i>Forms of Sensation</i>. Even in our own language, we retain a trace
of the influence of this Aristotelian notion, in the word
<i>Information</i>, when used for that knowledge which may be
conceived as moulding the mind into a definite shape, instead of
leaving it a mere mass of unimpressed susceptibility.</p>
<p>Another favorite Aristotelian antithesis is that of <i>Power</i>
and <i>Act</i> (δύναμις, ἐνέργεια). This distinction is made the basis
of most of the physical philosophy of the school; being, however,
generally introduced with a peculiar limitation. Thus, Light is
defined to be “the Act of what is lucid, as being lucid. And if,” it
is added, “the lucid be so in power but not in act, we have darkness.”
The reason of the limitation, “as being lucid,” is, that a lucid body
may act in other ways; thus a torch may move as well as shine, but its
moving is not its act <i>as being a lucid</i> body.</p>
<p>Aristotle appears to be well satisfied with this explanation, for
he goes on to say, “Thus light is not Fire, nor any body whatever, or
the emanation of any body (for that would be a kind of body), but it
is the presence of something like Fire in the body; it is, however,
impossible that two bodies should exist in the same place, so that it
is not a body;” and this reasoning appears to leave him more satisfied
with his doctrine, that Light is an <i>Energy</i> or <i>Act</i>.</p>
<p>But we have a more distinctly technical form given to this notion.
Aristotle introduced a word formed by himself to express the act which
is thus opposed to inactive power: this is the celebrated word
ἐντελέχεια. Thus the noted definition of Motion in the third book of
the Physics,<a id="fnanchor33-1" href="#note33-1"><span
class="fnanchor">33</span></a> is that it is “the <i>Entelechy</i>, or
Act, of a movable body in respect of being movable;” and the
definition of the Soul is<a id="fnanchor34-1" href="#note34-1"><span
class="fnanchor">34</span></a> that it is “the <i>Entelechy</i> of a
natural body which has life by reason of its power.” This word has
been variously translated by the followers of Aristotle, and some of
them have declared it untranslatable. <i>Act</i> and <i>Action</i> are
held to be inadequate substitutes; the <i>very act</i>, <i>ipse cursus
actionis</i>, is employed by some; <i>primus actus</i> is employed by
many, but another school use <i>primus actus</i> of a non-operating
form. Budæus uses <i>efficacia</i>. Cicero<a id="fnanchor35-1"
href="#note35-1"><span class="fnanchor">35</span></a> translates it
“quasi quandam continuatam motionem, et perennem;” but this
paraphrase, though it may <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page75">75</a></span> fall in with the description of the soul,
which is the subject with which Cicero is concerned, does not appear
to agree with the general applications of the term. Hermolaus Barbarus
is said to have been so much oppressed with this difficulty of
translation, that he consulted the evil spirit by night, entreating to
be supplied with a more common and familiar substitute for this word:
the mocking fiend, however, suggested only a word equally obscure, and
the translator, discontented with this, invented for himself the word
<i>perfectihabia</i>.</p>

<p>We need not here notice the endless apparatus of technicalities
which was, in later days, introduced into the Aristotelian philosophy;
but we may remark, that their long continuance and extensive use show
us how powerful technical phraseology is, for the perpetuation either
of truth or error. The Aristotelian terms, and the metaphysical views
which they tend to preserve, are not yet extinct among us. In a very
recent age of our literature it was thought a worthy employment by
some of the greatest writers of the day, to attempt to expel this
system of technicalities by ridicule.</p>
<p>“Crambe regretted extremely that <i>substantial forms</i>, a race
of harmless beings, which had lasted for many years, and afforded a
comfortable subsistence to many poor philosophers, should now be
hunted down like so many wolves, without a possibility of retreat. He
considered that it had gone much harder with them than with
<i>essences</i>, which had retired from the schools into the
apothecaries’ shops, where some of them had been advanced to the
degree of <i>quintessences</i>.<span class="correction" title="omitted

<p>We must now say a few words on the technical terms which others of
the Greek philosophical sects introduced.</p>
<p>2. <i>Technical Forms of the Platonists.</i>&#8212;The other sects
of the Greek philosophy, as well as the Aristotelians, invented and
adopted technical terms, and thus gave fixity to their tenets and
consistency to their traditionary systems; of these I will mention a
few.</p>
<p>A technical expression of a contemporary school has acquired
perhaps greater celebrity than any of the terms of Aristotle. I mean
the <i>Ideas</i> of Plato. The account which Aristotle gives of the
origin of these will serve to explain their nature.<a
id="fnanchor37-1" href="#note37-1"><span
class="fnanchor">37</span></a> “Plato,” says he, “who, in his youth,
was in habits of communication first with Cratylus and the Heraclitean
opinions, which represent all the objects of sense as being in a
perpetual flux, so that concerning these no science nor certain <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page76">76</a></span> knowledge can exist,
entertained the same opinions at a later period also. When,
afterwards, Socrates treated of moral subjects, and gave no attention
to physics, but, in the subjects which he did discuss, arrived at
universal truths, and before any man, turned his thoughts to
definitions, Plato adopted similar doctrines on this subject also; and
construed them in this way, that these truths and definitions must be
applicable to something else, and not to sensible things: for it was
impossible, he conceived, that there should be a general common
definition of any sensible object, since such were always in a state
of change. The things, then, which were the subjects of universal
truths he called <i>Ideas</i>; and held that objects of sense had
their names according to Ideas and after them; so that things
participated in that Idea which had the same name as was applied to
them.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note37-1"
href="#fnanchor37-1">37</a></span> Arist. Metaph. i. 6. The same
account is repeated, and the subject discussed, Metaph. xii. 4.</div>
<p>In agreement with this, we find the opinions suggested in the
<i>Parmenides</i> of Plato, the dialogue which is considered by many
to contain the most decided exposition of the doctrine of Ideas. In
this dialogue, Parmenides is made to say to Socrates, then a young
man,<a id="fnanchor38-1" href="#note38-1"><span
class="fnanchor">38</span></a> “O Socrates, philosophy has not yet
claimed you for her own, as, in my judgment, she will claim you, and
you will not dishonor her. As yet, like a young man as you are, you
look to the opinions of men. But tell me this: it appears to you, as
you say, that there are certain <i>Kinds</i> or <i>Ideas</i> (εἰδὴ) of
which things partake and receive applications according to that of
which they partake: thus those things which partake of <i>Likeness</i>
are called <i>like</i>; those things which partake of <i>Greatness</i>
are called <i>great</i>; those things which partake of <i>Beauty</i>
and <i>Justice</i> are called <i>beautiful</i> and <i>just</i>.” To
this Socrates assents. And in another part of the dialogue he shows
that these Ideas are not included in our common knowledge, from whence
he infers that they are objects of the Divine mind.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note38-1"
href="#fnanchor38-1">38</a></span> Parmenid. p. 131.</div>
<p>In the Phædo the same opinion is maintained, and is summed up in
this way, by a reporter of the last conversation of Socrates,<a
id="fnanchor39-1" href="#note39-1"><span
class="fnanchor">39</span></a> εἶναι τι ἕκαστον τῶν εἰδῶν, καὶ τούτων
τ’ ἄλλα μεταλαμβάνοντα αὐτῶν τούτων τὴν ἐπωνυμίαν ἴσχειν; “that each
<i>Kind</i> has an existence, and that other things partake of these
Kinds, and are called according to the Kind of which they
partake.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note39-1"
href="#fnanchor39-1">39</a></span> Phædo, p. 102.</div>
<p>The inference drawn from this view was, that in order to obtain
true and certain knowledge, men must elevate themselves, as much as
possible, to these Ideas of the qualities which they have to consider:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page77">77</a></span> and as things
were thus called after the Ideas, the Ideas had a priority and
pre-eminence assigned them. The <i>Idea</i> of Good, Beautiful, and
Wise was the “First Good,” the “First Beautiful,” the “First Wise.”
This dignity and distinction were ultimately carried to a large
extent. Those Ideas were described as eternal and self-subsisting,
forming an “Intelligible World,” full of the models or archetypes of
created things. But it is not to our purpose here to consider the
Platonic Ideas in their theological bearings. In physics they were
applied in the same form as in morals. The <i>primum calidum</i>,
<i>primum frigidum</i> were those Ideas of fundamental Principles by
participation of which, all things were hot or cold.</p>
<p>This school did not much employ itself in the development of its
principles as applied to physical inquiries: but we are not without
examples of such speculations. Plutarch’s Treatise Περὶ τοῦ Πρώτου
Ψυχροῦ, “On the First Cold,” may be cited as one. It is in reality a
discussion of a question which has been agitated in modern times
also;&#8212;whether cold be a positive quality or a mere privation.
“Is there, O Favorinus,” he begins, “a First Power and Essence of the
Cold, as Fire is of the Hot; by a certain presence and participation
of which all other things are cold: or is rather coldness a privation
of heat, as darkness is of light, and rest of motion?” ~Additional
material in the <a href="#platoideas">3rd edition</a>.~</p>
<p>3. <i>Technical Forms of the Pythagoreans.</i>&#8212;The
<i>Numbers</i> of the Pythagoreans, when propounded as the explanation
of physical phenomena, as they were, are still more obscure than the
Ideas of the Platonists. There were, indeed, considerable resemblances
in the way in which these two kinds of notions were spoken of. Plato
called his Ideas <i>unities</i>, <i>monads</i>; and as, according to
him, Ideas, so, according to the Pythagoreans, Numbers, were the
causes of things being what they are.<a id="fnanchor40-1"
href="#note40-1"><span class="fnanchor">40</span></a> But there was
this difference, that things shared the nature of the Platonic Ideas
“by participation,” while they shared the nature of Pythagorean
Numbers “by imitation.” Moreover, the Pythagoreans followed their
notion out into much greater development than any other school,
investing particular numbers with extraordinary attributes, and
applying them by very strange and forced analogies. Thus the number
Four, to which they gave the name of <i>Tetractys</i>, was held to be
the most perfect number, and was conceived to correspond to the human
soul, in some way which appears to be very imperfectly understood by
the commentators of this philosophy.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note40-1"
href="#fnanchor40-1">40</a></span> Arist. Metaph. i. 6.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page78">78</a></span> It has been
observed by a distinguished modern scholar,<a id="fnanchor41-1"
href="#note41-1"><span class="fnanchor">41</span></a> that the place
which Pythagoras ascribed to his numbers is intelligible only by
supposing that he confounded, first a numerical unit with a
geometrical point, and then this with a material atom. But this
criticism appears to place systems of physical philosophy under
requisitions too severe. If all the essential properties and
attributes of things were fully represented by the relations of
number, the philosophy which supplied such an explanation of the
universe, might well be excused from explaining also that existence of
objects which is distinct from the existence of all their qualities
and properties. The Pythagorean love of numerical speculations might
have been combined with the doctrine of atoms, and the combination
might have led to results well worth notice. But so far as we are
aware, no such combination was attempted in the ancient schools of
philosophy; and perhaps we of the present day are only just beginning
to perceive, through the disclosures of chemistry and crystallography,
the importance of such a line of inquiry.</p>

142.</div>
<p>4. <i>Technical Forms of the Atomists and Others.</i>&#8212;The
atomic doctrine, of which we have just spoken, was one of the most
definite of the physical doctrines of the ancients, and was applied
with most perseverance and knowledge to the explanation of phenomena.
Though, therefore, it led to no success of any consequence in ancient
times, it served to transmit, through a long series of ages, a habit
of really physical inquiry; and, on this account, has been thought
worthy of an historical disquisition by Bacon.<a id="fnanchor42-1"

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note42-1"

Democriti Philosophia, &amp;c., Works, vol. ix. 317.</div>
<p>The technical term, <i>Atom</i>, marks sufficiently the nature of
the opinion. According to this theory, the world consists of a
collection of simple particles, of one kind of matter, and of
indivisible smallness (as the name indicates), and by the various
configurations and motions of these particles, all kinds of matter and
all material phenomena are produced.</p>
<p>To this, the Atomic Doctrine of Leucippus and Democritus, was
opposed the <i>Homoiomeria</i> of Anaxagoras; that is, the opinion
that material things consist of particles which are homogeneous in
each kind of body, but various in different kinds: thus for example,
since by food the flesh and blood and bones of man increase, the
author of this doctrine held that there are in food particles of
flesh, and blood, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page79">79</a></span>
and bone. As the former tenet points to the corpuscular theories of
modern times, so the latter may be considered as a dim glimpse of the
idea of chemical analysis. The Stoics also, who were, especially at a
later period, inclined to materialist views, had their technical modes
of speaking on such subjects. They asserted that matter contained in
itself tendencies or dispositions to certain forms, which dispositions
they called λόγοι <span class="correction" title="emended from
σερματικοὶ">σπερματικοὶ</span>, <i>seminal proportions</i>, or
<i>seminal reasons</i>.</p>
<p>Whatever of sound view, or right direction, there might be in the
notions which suggested these and other technical expressions, was, in
all the schools of philosophy (so far as physics was concerned)
quenched and overlaid by the predominance of trifling and barren
speculations; and by the love of subtilizing and commenting upon the
works of earlier writers, instead of attempting to interpret the book
of nature. Hence these technical terms served to give fixity and
permanence to the traditional dogmas of the sect, but led to no
progress of knowledge.</p>
<p>The advances which were made in physical science proceeded, not
from these schools of philosophy (if we except, perhaps, the
obligations of the science of Harmonics to the Pythagoreans), but from
reasoners who followed an independent path. The sequel of the
ambitious hopes, the vast schemes, the confident undertakings of the
philosophers of ancient Greece, was an entire failure in the physical
knowledge of which it is our business to trace the history. Yet we are
not, on that account, to think slightingly of these early speculators.
They were men of extraordinary acuteness, invention, and range of
thought; and, above all, they had the merit of first completely
unfolding the speculative faculty&#8212;of starting in that keen and
vigorous chase of knowledge out of which all the subsequent culture
and improvement of man’s intellectual stores have arisen. The sages of
early Greece form the heroic age of science. Like the first navigators
in their own mythology, they boldly ventured their untried bark in a
distant and arduous voyage, urged on by the hopes of a supernatural
success; and though they missed the imaginary golden prize which they
sought, they unlocked the gates of distant regions, and opened the
seas to the keels of the thousands of adventurers who, in succeeding
times, sailed to and fro, to the indefinite increase of the mental
treasures of mankind.</p>
<p>But inasmuch as their attempts, in one sense, and at first, failed,
we must proceed to offer some account of this failure, and of its
nature and causes. <span class="pagenum"><a

<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> methods and forms of
philosophizing which we have described as employed by the Greek
Schools, failed altogether in their application to physics. No
discovery of general laws, no explanation of special phenomena,
rewarded the acuteness and boldness of these early students of nature.
Astronomy, which made considerable progress during the existence of
the sects of Greek philosophers, gained perhaps something by the
authority with which Plato taught the supremacy and universality of
mathematical rule and order; and the truths of Harmonics, which had
probably given rise to the Pythagorean passion for numbers, were
cultivated with much care by that school. But after these first
impulses, the sciences owed nothing to the philosophical sects; and
the vast and complex accumulations and apparatus of the Stagirite do
not appear to have led to any theoretical physical truths.</p>
<p>This assertion hardly requires proof, since in the existing body of
science there are no doctrines for which we are indebted to the
Aristotelian School. Real truths, when once established, remain to the
end of time a part of the mental treasure of man, and may be discerned
through all the additions of later days. But we can point out no
physical doctrine now received, of which we trace the anticipation in
Aristotle, in the way in which we see the Copernican system
anticipated by Aristarchus, the resolution of the heavenly appearances
into circular motions suggested by Plato, and the numerical relations
of musical intervals ascribed to Pythagoras. But it may be worth while
to look at this matter more closely.</p>
<p>Among the works of Aristotle are thirty-eight chapters of
“Problems,” which may serve to exemplify the progress he had really
made in the reduction of phenomena to laws and causes. Of these
Problems, a large proportion are physiological, and these I here pass
by, as not illustrative of the state of physical knowledge. But those
which are properly physical are, for the most part, questions
concerning such <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page81">81</a></span>
facts and difficulties as it is the peculiar business of theory to
explain. Now it may be truly said, that in scarcely any one instance
are the answers, which Aristotle gives to his questions, of any value.
For the most part, indeed, he propounds his answer with a degree of
hesitation or vacillation which of itself shows the absence of all
scientific distinctness of thought; and the opinions so offered never
appear to involve any settled or general principle.</p>
<p>We may take, as examples of this, the problems of the simplest
kind, where the principles lay nearest at hand&#8212;the mechanical
ones. “Why,” he asks,<a id="fnanchor43-1" href="#note43-1"><span
class="fnanchor">43</span></a> “do small forces move great weights by
means of a lever, when they have thus to move the lever added to the
weight? Is it,” he suggests, “because a greater radius moves faster?”
“Why does a small wedge split great weights?<a id="fnanchor44-1"
href="#note44-1"><span class="fnanchor">44</span></a> Is it because
the wedge is composed of two opposite levers?” “Why,<a
id="fnanchor45-1" href="#note45-1"><span
class="fnanchor">45</span></a> when a man rises from a chair, does he
bend his leg and his body to acute angles with his thigh? Is it
because a right angle is connected with equality and rest?” “Why<a
id="fnanchor46-1" href="#note46-1"><span
class="fnanchor">46</span></a> can a man throw a stone further with a
sling than with his hand? Is it that when he throws with his hand he
moves the stone from rest, but when he uses the sling he throws it
already in motion?” “Why,<a id="fnanchor47-1" href="#note47-1"><span
class="fnanchor">47</span></a> if a circle be thrown on the ground,
does it first describe a straight line and then a spiral, as it falls?
Is it that the air first presses equally on the two sides and supports
it, and afterwards presses on one side more?” “Why<a id="fnanchor48-1"
href="#note48-1"><span class="fnanchor">48</span></a> is it difficult
to distinguish a musical note from the octave above? Is it that
proportion stands in the place of equality?” It must be allowed that
these are very vague and worthless surmises; for even if we were, as
some commentators have done, to interpret some of them so as to agree
with sound philosophy, we should still be unable to point out, in this
author’s works, any clear or permanent apprehension of the general
principles which such an interpretation implies.</p>

<p>Thus the Aristotelian physics cannot be considered as otherwise
than a complete failure. It collected no general laws from facts; and
consequently, when it tried to explain facts, it had no principles
which were of any avail.</p>
<p>The same may be said of the physical speculations of the other
schools of philosophy. They arrived at no doctrines from which they
could deduce, by sound reasoning, such facts as they saw; though they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page82">82</a></span> often venture so
far to trust their principles as to infer from them propositions
beyond the domain of sense. Thus, the principle that each element
seeks <i>its own place</i>, led to the doctrine that, the place of
fire being the highest, there is, above the air, a Sphere of
Fire&#8212;of which doctrine the word <i>Empyrean</i>, used by our
poets, still conveys a reminiscence. The Pythagorean tenet that ten is
a perfect number,<a id="fnanchor49-1" href="#note49-1"><span
class="fnanchor">49</span></a> led some persons to assume that the
heavenly bodies are in number ten; and as nine only were known to
them, they asserted that there was an <i>antichthon</i>, or
<i>counter-earth</i>, on the other side of the sun, invisible to us.
Their opinions respecting numerical ratios, led to various other
speculations concerning the distances and positions of the heavenly
bodies: and as they had, in other cases, found a connection between
proportions of distance and musical notes, they assumed, on this
suggestion, <i>the music of the spheres</i>.</p>

<p>Although we shall look in vain in the physical philosophy of the
Greek Schools for any results more valuable than those just mentioned,
we shall not be surprised to find, recollecting how much an admiration
for classical antiquity has possessed the minds of men, that some
writers estimate their claims much more highly than they are stated
here. Among such writers we may notice Dutens, who, in 1766, published
his “Origin of the Discoveries attributed to the Moderns; in which it
is shown that our most celebrated Philosophers have received the
greatest part of their knowledge from the Works of the Ancients.” The
thesis of this work is attempted to be proved, as we might expect, by
very large interpretations of the general phrases used by the
ancients. Thus, when Timæus, in Plato’s dialogue, says of the Creator
of the world,<a id="fnanchor50-1" href="#note50-1"><span
class="fnanchor">50</span></a> “that he infused into it two powers,
the origins of motions, both of that of the same thing and of that of
different things;” Dutens<a id="fnanchor51-1" href="#note51-1"><span
class="fnanchor">51</span></a> finds in this a clear indication of the
projectile and attractive forces of modern science. And in some of the
common declamation of the Pythagoreans and Platonists concerning the
general prevalence of numerical relations in the universe, he
discovers their acquaintance with the law of the inverse square of the
distance by which gravitation is regulated, though he allows<a
id="fnanchor52-1" href="#note52-1"><span
class="fnanchor">52</span></a> that it required all the penetration of
Newton and his followers to detect this law in the scanty fragments by
which it is transmitted.</p>

<p>Argument of this kind is palpably insufficient to cover the failure
of the Greek attempts at a general physical philosophy; or rather we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page83">83</a></span> may say, that
such arguments, since they are as good as can be brought in favor of
such an opinion, show more clearly how entire the failure was. I
proceed now to endeavor to point out its causes.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Cause of the Failure of the Greek
Physical Philosophy.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> cause of the failure of so many of the
attempts of the Greeks to construct physical science is so important,
that we must endeavor to bring it into view here; though the full
development of such subjects belongs rather to the Philosophy of
Induction. The subject must, at present, be treated very briefly.</p>
<p>I will first notice some errors which may naturally occur to the
reader’s mind, as possible causes of failure, but which, we shall be
able to show, were not the real reasons in this case.</p>
<p>The cause of failure was <em>not the neglect of facts</em>. It is
often said that the Greeks disregarded experience, and spun their
philosophy out of their own thoughts alone; and this is supposed by
many to be their essential error. It is, no doubt, true, that the
disregard of experience is a phrase which may be so interpreted as to
express almost any defect of philosophical method; since coincidence
with experience is requisite to the truth of all theory. But if we fix
a more precise sense on our terms, I conceive it may be shown that the
Greek philosophy did, in its opinions, recognize the necessity and
paramount value of observations; did, in its origin, proceed upon
observed facts; and did employ itself to no small extent in
classifying and arranging phenomena. We must endeavor to illustrate
these assertions, because it is important to show that these steps
alone do not necessarily lead to science.</p>
<p>1. The acknowledgment of experience as the main ground of physical
knowledge is so generally understood to be a distinguishing feature of
later times, that it may excite surprise to find that Aristotle, and
other ancient philosophers, not only asserted in the most pointed
manner that all our knowledge must begin from experience, but also
stated in language much resembling the habitual phraseology of the
most modern schools of philosophizing, that particular facts must be
<em>collected</em>; that from these, general principles must be
obtained by <em>induction</em>; and that these principles, when of the
most general kind, are <em>axioms</em>. A few passages will show
this.</p>
<p>“The way<a id="fnanchor53-1" href="#note53-1"><span
class="fnanchor">53</span></a> must be the same,” says Aristotle, in
speaking of the rules of reasoning, “with respect to philosophy, as it
is with respect to <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page84">84</a></span> any art or science whatever; we must
collect the facts, and the things to which the facts happen, in each
subject, and provide as large a supply of these as possible.” He then
proceeds to say that “we are not to look at once at all this collected
mass, but to consider small and definite portions” . . . “And thus it
is the office of observation to supply principles in each subject; for
instance, astronomical observation supplies the principles of
astronomical science. For the phenomena being properly assumed, the
astronomical demonstrations were from these discovered. And the same
applies to every art and science. So that if we take the facts (τὰ
ὑπάρχοντα) belonging to each subject, it is <em>our</em> task to mark
out clearly the course of the demonstrations. For if <em>in our
natural history</em> (κατὰ τὴν ἱστορίαν) we have omitted nothing of
the facts and properties which belong to the subject, we shall learn
what we can demonstrate and what we cannot.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note53-1"
href="#fnanchor53-1">53</a></span> Anal. Prior. i. 30.</div>
<p>These facts, τὰ ὑπάρχοντα, he, at other times, includes in the term
<i>sensation</i>. Thus, he says,<a id="fnanchor54-1"
href="#note54-1"><span class="fnanchor">54</span></a> “It is obvious
that if any sensation is wanting, there must be also some knowledge
wanting which we are thus prevented from having, since we arrive at
knowledge either by induction or by demonstration. Demonstration
proceeds from universal propositions, Induction from particulars. But
we cannot have universal theoretical propositions except from
induction; and we cannot make inductions without having sensation; for
sensation has to do with particulars.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note54-1"
href="#fnanchor54-1">54</a></span> Anal. Post. i. 18.</div>
<p>In another place,<a id="fnanchor55-1" href="#note55-1"><span
class="fnanchor">55</span></a> after stating that principles must be
prior to, and better known than conclusions, he distinguishes such
principles into absolutely prior, and prior relative to us: “The prior
principles, relative to us, are those which are nearer to the
sensation; but the principles absolutely prior are those which are
more remote from the sensation. The most general principles are the
more remote, the more particular are nearer. The general principles
which are necessary to knowledge are <i>axioms</i>.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note55-1"
href="#fnanchor55-1">55</a></span> Ib. i. 2.</div>
<p>We may add to these passages, that in which he gives an account of
the way in which Leucippus was led to the doctrine of atoms. After
describing the opinions of some earlier philosophers, he says,<a
id="fnanchor56-1" href="#note56-1"><span
class="fnanchor">56</span></a> “Thus, proceeding in violation of
sensation, and disregarding it, because, as they held, they must
follow reason, some came to the conclusion that the universe was one,
and infinite, and at rest. As it appeared, however, that though this
ought to be by reasoning, it <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page85">85</a></span> would go near to madness to hold such
opinions in practice (for no one was ever so mad as to think fire and
ice to be one), Leucippus, therefore, pursued a line of reasoning
which was in accordance with sensation, and which was not
irreconcilable with the production and decay, the motion and multitude
of things.” It is obvious that the school to which Leucippus belonged
(the Eclectic) must have been, at least in its origin, strongly
impressed with the necessity of bringing its theories into harmony
with the observed course of nature.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note56-1"
href="#fnanchor56-1">56</a></span> De Gen. et Cor. i. 8.</div>
<p>2. Nor was this recognition of the fundamental value of experience
a mere profession. The Greek philosophy did, in its beginning, proceed
upon observation. Indeed it is obvious that the principles which it
adopted were, in the first place, assumed in order to account for some
classes of facts, however imperfectly they might answer their purpose.
The principle of things seeking their own places, was invented in
order to account for the falling and floating of bodies. Again,
Aristotle says, that heat is that which brings together things of the
same kind, cold is that which brings together things whether of the
same or of different kinds: it is plain that in this instance he
intended by his principle to explain some obvious facts, as the
freezing of moist substances, and the separation of heterogeneous
things by fusion; for, as he adds, if fire brings together things
which are akin, it will separate those which are not akin. It would be
easy to illustrate the remark further, but its truth is evident from
the nature of the case; for no principles could be accepted for a
moment, which were the result of an arbitrary caprice of the mind, and
which were not in some measure plausible, and apparently confirmed by
facts.</p>
<p>But the works of Aristotle show, in another way, how unjust it
would be to accuse him of disregarding facts. Many large treatises of
his consist almost entirely of collections of facts, as for instance,
those “On Colors,” “On Sounds,” and the collection of Problems to
which we have already referred; to say nothing of the numerous
collection of facts bearing on natural history and physiology, which
form a great portion of his works, and are even now treasuries of
information. A moment’s reflection will convince us that the physical
sciences of our own times, for example. Mechanics and Hydrostatics,
are founded almost entirely upon facts with which the ancients were as
familiar as we are. The defect of their philosophy, therefore,
wherever it may lie, consists neither in the speculative depreciation
of the value of facts, nor in the practical neglect of their use.</p>
<p>3. Nor again, should we hit upon the truth, if we were to say that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page86">86</a></span> Aristotle, and
other ancient philosophers, did indeed collect facts; but that they
took no steps in classifying and comparing them; and that thus they
failed to obtain from them any general knowledge. For, in reality, the
treatises of Aristotle which we have mentioned, are as remarkable for
the power of classifying and systematizing which they exhibit, as for
the industry shown in the accumulation. But it is not classification
of facts merely which can lead us to knowledge, except we adopt that
special arrangement, which, in each case, brings into view the
principles of the subject. We may easily show how unprofitable an
arbitrary or random classification is, however orderly and systematic
it may be.</p>
<p>For instance, for a long period all unusual fiery appearances in
the sky were classed together as <i>meteors</i>. Comets,
shooting-stars, and globes of fire, and the aurora borealis in all its
forms, were thus grouped together, and classifications of considerable
extent and minuteness were proposed with reference to these objects.
But this classification was of a mixed and arbitrary kind. Figure,
color, motion, duration, were all combined as characters, and the
imagination lent its aid, transforming these striking appearances into
fiery swords and spears, bears and dragons, armies and chariots. The
facts so classified were, notwithstanding, worthless; and would not
have been one jot the less so, had they and their classes been ten
times as numerous as they were. No rule or law that would stand the
test of observation was or could be thus discovered. Such
classifications have, therefore, long been neglected and forgotten.
Even the ancient descriptions of these objects of curiosity are
unintelligible, or unworthy of trust, because the spectators had no
steady conception of the usual order of such phenomena. For, however
much we may fear to be misled by preconceived opinions, the caprices
of imagination distort our impressions far more than the anticipations
of reason. In this case men had, indeed we may say with regard to many
of these meteors, they still have, no science: not for want of facts,
nor even for want of classification of facts; but because the
classification was one in which no real principle was contained.</p>
<p>4. Since, as we have said <a href="#v1page43">before</a>, two
things are requisite to science,&#8212;Facts and Ideas; and since, as
we have seen. Facts were not wanting in the physical speculations of
the ancients, we are naturally led to ask, Were they then deficient in
Ideas? Was there a want among them of mental activity, and logical
connection of thought? But it is so obvious that the answer to this
inquiry must be in the negative, that we need not dwell upon it. No
one who knows any thing of the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page87">87</a></span> history of the ancient Greek mind, can
question, that in acuteness, in ingenuity, in the power of close and
distinct reasoning, they have never been surpassed. The common
opinion, which considers the defect of their philosophical character
to reside rather in the exclusive activity of such qualities, than in
the absence of them, is at least so far just.</p>
<p>5. We come back again, therefore, to the question, What was the
radical and fatal defect in the physical speculations of the Greek
philosophical schools?</p>
<p>To this I answer: The defect was, that though they had in their
possession Facts and Ideas, <em>the Ideas were not distinct and
appropriate to the Facts</em>.</p>
<p>The peculiar characteristics of scientific ideas, which I have
endeavored to express by speaking of them as <i>distinct</i> and
<i>appropriate to the facts</i>, must be more fully and formally set
forth, when we come to the philosophy of the subject. In the mean
time, the reader will probably have no difficulty in conceiving that,
for each class of Facts, there is some special set of Ideas, by means
of which the facts can be included in general scientific truths; and
that these Ideas, which may thus be termed <i>appropriate</i>, must be
possessed with entire distinctness and clearness, in order that they
may be successfully applied. It was the want of Ideas having this
reference to material phenomena, which rendered the ancient
philosophers, with very few exceptions, helpless and unsuccessful
speculators on physical subjects.</p>
<p>This must be illustrated by one or two examples. One of the facts
which Aristotle endeavors to explain is this; that when the sun’s
light passes through a hole, whatever be the form of the hole, the
bright image, if formed at any considerable distance from the hole, is
round, instead of imitating the figure of the hole, as shadows
resemble their objects in form. We shall easily perceive this
appearance to be a necessary consequence of the circular figure of the
sun, if we conceive light to be diffused from the luminary by means of
straight rays proceeding from every point of the sun’s disk and
passing through every point within the boundary of the hole. By
attending to the consequences of this mode of conception, it will be
seen that each point of the hole will be the vertex of a double cone
of rays which has the sun’s disk for its base on one side and an image
of the sun on the other; and the figure of the image of the hole will
be determined by supposing a series of equal bright circles, images of
the sun, to be placed along the boundary of an image equal to the hole
itself. The figure of the image thus determined will partake of the
form of the hole, and <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page88">88</a></span> of the circular form of the sun’s image:
but these circular images become larger and larger as they are further
from the hole, while the central image of the hole remains always of
the original size; and thus at a considerable distance from the hole,
the trace of the hole’s form is nearly obliterated, and the image is
nearly a perfect circle. Instead of this distinct conception of a cone
of rays which has the sun’s disk for its basis, Aristotle has the
following loose conjecture.<a id="fnanchor57-1" href="#note57-1"><span
class="fnanchor">57</span></a> “Is it because light is emitted in a
conical form; and of a cone, the base is a circle; so that on whatever
the rays of the sun fall, they appear more circular?” And thus though
he applies the notion of rays to this problem, he possesses this
notion so <em>indistinctly</em> that his explanation is of no value.
He does not introduce into his explanation the consideration of the
sun’s circular figure, and is thus prevented from giving a true
account of this very simple optical phenomenon.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note57-1"
href="#fnanchor57-1">57</a></span> Problem. 15, ὁσα μαθηματίκης,
&amp;c.</div>
<p>6. Again, to pass to a more extensive failure: why was it that
Aristotle, knowing the property of the lever, and many other
mechanical truths, was unable to form them into a science of
mechanics, as Archimedes afterwards did?</p>
<p>The reason was, that, instead of considering rest and motion
directly, and distinctly, with reference to the Idea of Cause, that is
Force, he wandered in search of reasons among other ideas and notions,
which could not be brought into steady connection with the
facts;&#8212;the ideas of properties of circles, of proportions of
velocities,&#8212;the notions of “strange” and “common,” of “natural”
and “unnatural.” Thus, in the Proem to his Mechanical Problems, after
stating some of the difficulties which he has to attack, he says, “Of
all such cases, the circle contains the principle of the cause. And
this is what might be looked for; for it is nothing absurd, if
something <em>wonderful</em> is derived from something more wonderful
still. Now the most wonderful thing is, that opposites should be
combined; and the circle is constituted of such combinations of
opposites. For it is constructed by a stationary point and a moving
line, which are contrary to each other in nature; and hence we may the
less be surprised at the resulting contrarieties. And in the first
place, the circumference of the circle, though a line without breadth,
has opposite qualities; for it is both <i>convex</i> and
<i>concave</i>. In the next place, it has, at the same time, opposite
motions, for it moves forward and backward at the same time. For the
circumference, setting out from any point, comes to the same point
again, so <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page89">89</a></span> that by
a continuous progression, the last point becomes the first. So that,
as was before stated, it is not surprising that the circle should be
the principle of all wonderful properties.”</p>
<p>Aristotle afterwards proceeds to explain more specially how he
applies the properties of the circle in this case. “The reason,” he
says, in his fourth Problem, “why a force, acting at a greater
distance from the fulcrum, moves a weight more easily, is, that it
describes a greater circle.” He had already asserted that when a body
at the end of a lever is put in motion, it may be considered as having
two motions; one in the direction of the tangent, and one in the
direction of the radius; the former motion is, he says, <i>according
to nature</i>, the latter, <i>contrary to nature</i>. Now in the
smaller circle, the motion, contrary to nature, is more considerable
than it is in the larger circle. “Therefore,” he adds, “the mover or
weight at the larger arm will be transferred further by the same force
than the weight moved, which is at the extremity of the shorter
arm.”</p>
<p>These loose and inappropriate notions of “natural” and “unnatural”
motions, were unfit to lead to any scientific truths; and, with the
habits of thought which dictated these speculations a perception of
the true grounds of mechanical properties was impossible.</p>
<p>7. Thus, in this instance, the error of Aristotle was the neglect
of the Idea <em>appropriate</em> to the facts, namely, the Idea of
Mechanical Cause, which is Force; and the substitution of vague or
inapplicable notions involving only relations of space or emotions of
wonder. The errors of those who failed similarly in other instances,
were of the same kind. To detail or classify these would lead us too
far into the philosophy of science; since we should have to enumerate
the Ideas which are appropriate, and the various classes of Facts on
which the different sciences are founded,&#8212;a task not to be now
lightly undertaken. But it will be perceived, without further
explanation, that it is necessary, in order to obtain from facts any
general truth, that we should apply to them that appropriate Idea, by
which permanent and definite relations are established among them.</p>
<p>In such Ideas the ancients were very poor, and the stunted and
deformed growth of their physical science was the result of this
penury. The Ideas of Space and Time, Number and Motion, they did
indeed possess distinctly; and so far as these went, their science was
tolerably healthy. They also caught a glimpse of the Idea of a Medium
by which the qualities of bodies, as colors and sounds, are perceived.
But the idea of Substance remained barren in their hands; <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page90">90</a></span> in speculating about
elements and qualities, they went the wrong way, assuming that the
properties of Compounds must <em>resemble</em> those of the Elements
which determine them; and their loose notions of Contrariety never
approached the form of those ideas of Polarity, which, in modern
times, regulate many parts of physics and chemistry.</p>
<p>If this statement should seem to any one to be technical or
arbitrary, we must refer, for the justification of it, to the
Philosophy of Science, of which we hope hereafter to treat. But it
will appear, even from what has been here said, that there are certain
Ideas or Forms of mental apprehension, which may be applied to Facts
in such a manner as to bring into view fundamental principles of
science; while the same Facts, however arrayed or reasoned about, so
long as these appropriate ideas are not employed, cannot give rise to
any exact or substantial knowledge.</p>
<p>[2d Ed.] This account of the cause of failure in the physical
speculations of the ancient Greek philosophers has been objected to as
unsatisfactory. I will offer a few words in explanation of it.</p>
<p>The mode of accounting for the failure of the Greeks in physics is,
in substance;&#8212;that the Greeks in their physical speculations
fixed their attention upon the wrong aspects and relations of the
phenomena; and that the aspects and relations in which phenomena are
to be viewed in order to arrive at scientific truths may be arranged
under certain heads, which I have termed <i>Ideas</i>; such as Space,
Time, Number, Cause, Likeness. In every case, there is an Idea to
which the phenomena may be referred, so as to bring into view the Laws
by which they are governed; this Idea I term the <i>appropriate</i>
Idea in such case; and in order that the reference of the phenomena to
the Law may be clearly seen, the Idea must be <em>distinctly</em>
possessed.</p>
<p>Thus the reason of Aristotle’s failure in his attempts at
Mechanical Science is, that he did not refer the facts to the
appropriate Idea, namely Force, the Cause of Motion, but to relations
of Space and the like; that is, he introduces <em>Geometrical</em>
instead of <em>Mechanical</em> Ideas. It may be said that we learn
little by being told that Aristotle’s failure in this and the like
cases arose from his referring to the wrong class of Ideas; or, as I
have otherwise expressed it, fixing his attention upon the wrong
aspects and relations of the facts; since, it may be said, this is
only to state in other words that he <em>did</em> fail. But this
criticism is, I think, ill-founded. The account which I have given is
not only a statement that Aristotle, and others who took a like
course, did fail; but also, that they failed in one certain point out
of several <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page91">91</a></span> which
are enumerated. They did not fail because they neglected to observe
facts; they did not fail because they omitted to class facts; they did
not fail because they had not ideas to reason from; but they failed
because they did not take the right ideas in each case. And so long as
they were in the wrong in this point, no industry in collecting facts,
or ingenuity in classing them and reasoning about them, could lead
them to solid truth.</p>
<p>Nor is this account of the nature of their mistake without its
instruction for us; although we are not to expect to derive from the
study of their failure any technical rule which shall necessarily
guide us to scientific discovery. For their failure teaches us that,
in the formation of science, an Error in the Ideas is as fatal to the
discovery of Truth as an Error in the Facts; and may as completely
impede the progress of knowledge. I have in Books <span
class="sc">ii.</span> to <span class="sc">x.</span> of the
<i>Philosophy</i>, shown historically how large a portion of the
progress of Science consists in the establishment of Appropriate Ideas
as the basis of each science. Of the two main processes by which
science is constructed, as stated in Book <span class="sc">xi.</span>
of that work, namely the <i>Explication of Conceptions</i> and the
<i>Colligation of Facts</i>, the former must precede the latter. In
Book <span class="sc">xii.</span> chap. 5, of the <i>Philosophy</i>, I
have stated the maxim concerning appropriate Ideas in this form, that
<em>the Idea and the Facts must be homogeneous</em>.</p>
<p>When I say that the failure of the Greeks in physical science arose
from their not employing <em>appropriate</em> Ideas to connect the
facts, I do not use the term “appropriate” in a loose popular sense;
but I employ it as a somewhat technical term, to denote <em>the</em>
appropriate Idea, out of that series of Ideas which have been made (as
I have shown in the <i>Philosophy</i>) the foundation of sciences;
namely, Space, Time, Number, Cause, Likeness, Substance, and the rest.
It appears to me just to say that Aristotle’s failure in his attempts
to deal with problems of equilibrium, arose from his referring to
circles, velocities, notions of natural and unnatural, and the
like,&#8212;conceptions depending upon Ideas of Space, of Nature,
&amp;c.&#8212;which are not appropriate to these problems, and from
his missing the Idea of Mechanical Force or Pressure, which is the
appropriate Idea.</p>
<p>I give this, not as an account of <em>all</em> failures in attempts
at science, but only as the account of such radical and fundamental
failures as this of Aristotle; who, with a knowledge of the facts,
failed to connect them into a really scientific view. If I had to
compare rival theories of a more complex kind, I should not
necessarily say that one involved <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page92">92</a></span> an appropriate Idea and the other did not,
though I might judge one to be true and the other to be false. For
instance, in comparing the emissive and the undulatory theory of
light, we see that both involve the same Idea;&#8212;the Idea of a
Medium acting by certain mechanical properties. The question there is,
What is the true view of the mechanism of the Medium?</p>
<p>It may be remarked, however, that the example of Aristotle’s
failure in physics, given in <a href="#v1page87">p. 87</a>, namely,
his attempted explanation of the round image of a square hole, is a
specimen rather of <em>indistinct</em> than of inappropriate
ideas.</p>
<p>The geometrical explanation of this phenomenon, which I have there
inserted, was given by Maurolycus, and before him, by Leonardo da
Vinci.</p>
<p>We shall, in the next  <a href="#v1page93">Book</a>, see the
influence of the appropriate general Ideas, in the formation of
various sciences. It need only be observed, before we proceed, that,
in order to do full justice to the physical knowledge of the Greek
Schools of philosophy, it is not necessary to study their course after
the time of their founders. Their fortunes, in respect of such
acquisitions as we are now considering, were not progressive. The
later chiefs of the Schools followed the earlier masters; and though
they varied much, they added little. The Romans adopted the philosophy
of their Greek subjects; but they were always, and, indeed,
acknowledged themselves to be, inferior to their teachers. They were
as arbitrary and loose in their ideas as the Greeks, without
possessing their invention, acuteness, and spirit of system.</p>
<p>In addition to the vagueness which was combined with the more
elevated trains of philosophical speculation among the Greeks, the
Romans introduced into their treatises a kind of declamatory rhetoric,
which arose probably from their forensic and political habits, and
which still further obscured the waning gleams of truth. Yet we may
also trace in the Roman philosophers to whom this charge mostly
applies (Lucretius, Pliny, Seneca), the national vigor and ambition.
There is something Roman in the public spirit and anticipation of
universal empire which they display, as citizens of the intellectual
republic. Though they speak sadly or slightingly of the achievements
of their own generation, they betray a more abiding and vivid belief
in the dignity and destined advance of human knowledge as a whole,
than is obvious among the Greeks.</p>
<p class="end">We must, however, turn back, in order to describe steps
of more definite value to the progress of science than those which we
have hitherto noticed.  ~Additional material in the <a

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IN</span> order to the acquisition of
any such exact and real knowledge of nature as that which we properly
call Physical Science, it is requisite, as has already been said, that
men should possess Ideas both distinct and appropriate, and should
apply them to ascertained Facts. They are thus led to propositions of
a general character, which are obtained by Induction, as will
elsewhere be more fully explained. We proceed now to trace the
formation of Sciences among the Greeks by such processes. The
provinces of knowledge which thus demand our attention are, Astronomy,
Mechanics and Hydrostatics, Optics and Harmonics; of which I must
relate, first, the earliest stages, and next, the subsequent
progress.</p>
<p>Of these portions of human knowledge, Astronomy is, beyond doubt or
comparison, much the most ancient and the most remarkable; and
probably existed, in somewhat of a scientific form, in Chaldea and
Egypt, and other countries, before the period of the intellectual
activity of the Greeks. But I will give a brief account of some of the
other Sciences before I proceed to Astronomy, for two reasons; first,
because the origin of Astronomy is lost in the obscurity of a remote
antiquity; and therefore we cannot exemplify the conditions of the
first rise of science so well in that subject as we can in others
which assumed their scientific form at known periods; and next, in
order that I may not have to interrupt, after I have once begun it,
the history of the only progressive Science which the ancient world
produced.</p>
<p>It has been objected to the arrangement here employed that it is
not symmetrical; and that Astronomy, as being one of the Physical
Sciences, ought to have occupied a chapter in this Second Book,
instead of having a whole Book to itself (<a href="#v1page109">Book
<span class="sc">iii</span></a>). I do not pretend that the
arrangement is symmetrical, and have employed it only on the ground of
convenience. The importance and extent of the history of Astronomy are
such that this science could not, with a view to our purposes, be made
co-ordinate with Mechanics or Optics. <span class="pagenum"><a

<h3 class="space-above">CHAPTER I.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Earliest Stages of Mechanics and
Hydrostatics.</span></h3>
<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Mechanics.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">ASTRONOMY</span> is a science so
ancient that we can hardly ascend to a period when it did not exist;
Mechanics, on the other hand, is a science which did not begin to be
till after the time of Aristotle; for Archimedes must be looked upon
as the author of the first sound knowledge on this subject. What is
still more curious, and shows remarkably how little the continued
progress of science follows inevitably from the nature of man, this
department of knowledge, after the right road had been fairly entered
upon, remained absolutely stationary for nearly two thousand years; no
single step was made, in addition to the propositions established by
Archimedes, till the time of Galileo and Stevinus. This extraordinary
halt will be a subject of attention hereafter; at present we must
consider the original advance.</p>
<p>The great step made by Archimedes in Mechanics was the
establishing, upon true grounds, the general proposition concerning a
straight lever, loaded with two heavy bodies, and resting upon a
fulcrum. The proposition is, that two bodies so circumstanced will
balance each other, when the distance of the smaller body from the
fulcrum is greater than the distance of the other, in exactly the same
proportion in which the weight of the body is less.</p>
<p>This proposition is proved by Archimedes in a work which is still
extant, and the proof holds its place in our treatises to this day, as
the simplest which can be given. The demonstration is made to rest on
assumptions which amount in effect to such Definitions and Axioms as
these: That those bodies are of equal weight which balance each other
at equal arms of a straight lever; and that in every heavy body there
is a definite point called a <i>Centre of Gravity</i>, in which point
we may suppose the weight of the body collected.</p>
<p>The principle, which is really the foundation of the validity of
the demonstration thus given, and which is the condition of all
experimental knowledge on the subject, is this: that when two equal
weights are supported on a lever, they act on the fulcrum of the lever
with the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page97">97</a></span> same
effect as if they were both together supported immediately at that
point. Or more generally, we may state the principle to be this: that
the pressure by which a heavy body is supported continues the same,
however we alter the form or position of the body, so long as the
magnitude and material continue the same.</p>
<p>The experimental truth of this principle is a matter of obvious and
universal experience. The weight of a basket of stones is not altered
by shaking the stones into new positions. We cannot make the direct
burden of a stone less by altering its position in our hands; and if
we try the effect on a balance or a machine of any kind, we shall see
still more clearly and exactly that the altered position of one
weight, or the altered arrangement of several, produces no change in
their effect, so long as their point of support remains unchanged.</p>
<p>This general fact is obvious, when we possess in our minds the
ideas which are requisite to apprehend it clearly. But when we are so
prepared, the truth appears to be manifest, even independent of
experience, and is seen to be a rule to which experience must conform.
What, then, is the leading idea which thus enables us to reason
effectively upon mechanical subjects? By attention to the course of
such reasonings, we perceive that it is the idea of <i>Pressure</i>;
Pressure being conceived as a measurable effect of heavy bodies at
rest, distinguishable from all other effects, such as motion, change
of figure, and the like. It is not here necessary to attempt to trace
the history of this idea in our minds; but it is certain that such an
idea may be distinctly formed, and that upon it the whole science of
statics may be built. <i>Pressure</i>, <i>load</i>, <i>weight</i>, are
names by which this idea is denoted when the effect tends directly
downwards; but we may have pressure without motion, or <i>dead
pull</i>, in other cases, as at the critical instant when two
nicely-matched wrestlers are balanced by the exertion of the utmost
strength of each.</p>
<p>Pressure in any direction may thus exist without any motion
whatever. But the causes which produce such pressure are capable of
producing motion, and are generally seen producing motion, as in the
above instance of the wrestlers, or in a pair of scales employed in
weighing; and thus men come to consider pressure as the exception, and
motion as the rule: or perhaps they image to themselves the motion
which <i>might</i> or <i>would</i> take place; for instance, the
motion which the arms of a lever <i>would</i> have if they <i>did</i>
move. They turn away from the case really before them, which is that
of bodies at rest, and balancing each other, and pass to another case,
which is arbitrarily <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page98">98</a></span> assumed to represent the first. Now this
arbitrary and capricious evasion of the question we consider as
opposed to the introduction of the distinct and proper idea of
Pressure, by means of which the true principles of this subject can be
apprehended.</p>
<p>We have already seen that Aristotle was in the number of those who
thus evaded the difficulties of the problem of the lever, and
consequently lost the reward of success. He failed, as has before been
stated, in consequence of his seeking his principles in notions,
either vague and loose, as the distinction of natural and unnatural
motions, or else inappropriate, as the circle which the weight
<i>would</i> describe, the velocity which it <i>would</i> have if it
moved; circumstances which are not part of the fact under
consideration. The influence of such modes of speculation was the main
hindrance to the prosecution of the true Archimedean form of the
science of Mechanics.</p>
<p>The mechanical doctrine of Equilibrium, is <i>Statics</i>. It is to
be distinguished from the mechanical doctrine of Motion, which is
termed <i>Dynamics</i>, and which was not successfully treated till
the time of Galileo.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Hydrostatics.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">Archimedes</span> not only laid the foundations of
the Statics of solid bodies, but also solved the principal problem of
<i>Hydrostatics</i>, or the Statics of Fluids; namely, the conditions
of the floating of bodies. This is the more remarkable, since not only
did the principles which Archimedes established on this subject remain
unpursued till the revival of science in modern times, but, when they
were again put forward, the main proposition was so far from obvious
that it was termed, and is to this day called, the <i>hydrostatic
paradox</i>. The true doctrine of Hydrostatics, however, assuming the
Idea of Pressure, which it involves, in common with the Mechanics of
solid bodies, requires also a distinct Idea of a Fluid, as a body of
which the parts are perfectly movable among each other by the
slightest partial pressure, and in which all pressure exerted on one
part is transferred to all other parts. From this idea of Fluidity,
necessarily follows that multiplication of pressure which constitutes
the hydrostatic paradox; and the notion being seen to be verified in
nature, the consequences were also realized as facts. This notion of
Fluidity is expressed in the postulate which stands at the head of
Archimedes’ “Treatise on Floating Bodies.” And from this principle are
deduced the solutions, not only of the simple problems of the science,
but of some problems of considerable complexity. <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page99">99</a></span></p>
<p>The difficulty of holding fast this Idea of Fluidity so as to trace
its consequences with infallible strictness of demonstration, may be
judged of from the circumstance that, even at the present day, men of
great talents, not unfamiliar with the subject, sometimes admit into
their reasonings an oversight or fallacy with regard to this very
point. The importance of the Idea when clearly apprehended and
securely held, may be judged of from this, that the whole science of
Hydrostatics in its most modern form is only the development of the
Idea. And what kind of attempts at science would be made by persons
destitute of this Idea, we may see in the speculations of Aristotle
concerning light and heavy bodies, which we have already quoted;
where, by considering light and heavy as opposite qualities, residing
in things themselves, and by an inability to apprehend the effect of
surrounding fluids in supporting bodies, the subject was made a mass
of false or frivolous assertions, which the utmost ingenuity could not
reconcile with facts, and could still less deduce from the asserted
doctrines any new practical truths.</p>
<p>In the case of Statics and Hydrostatics, the most important
condition of their advance was undoubtedly the distinct apprehension
of these two <i>appropriate Ideas</i>&#8212;<i>Statical Pressure</i>,
and <i>Hydrostatical Pressure</i> as included in the idea of Fluidity.
For the Ideas being once clearly possessed, the experimental laws
which they served to express (that the whole pressure of a body
downwards was always the same; and that water, and the like, were
fluids according to the above idea of fluidity), were so obvious, that
there was no doubt nor difficulty about them. These two ideas lie at
the root of all mechanical science; and the firm possession of them
is, to this day, the first requisite for a student of the subject.
After being clearly awakened in the mind of Archimedes, these ideas
slept for many centuries, till they were again called up in Galileo,
and more remarkably in Stevinus. This time, they were not destined
again to slumber; and the results of their activity have been the
formation of two Sciences, which are as certain and severe in their
demonstrations as geometry itself and as copious and interesting in
their conclusions; but which, besides this recommendation, possess one
of a different order,&#8212;that they exhibit the exact impress of the
laws of the physical world, and unfold a portion of the rules
according to which the phenomena of nature take place, and must take
place, till nature herself shall alter. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page100">100</a></span></p>
<h3 class="space-above">CHAPTER II.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Earliest Stages of Optics.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> progress made by the
ancients in Optics was nearly proportional to that which they made in
Statics. As they discovered the true grounds of the doctrine of
Equilibrium, without obtaining any sound principles concerning Motion,
so they discovered the law of the Reflection of light, but had none
but the most indistinct notions concerning Refraction.</p>
<p>The extent of the principles which they really possessed is easily
stated. They knew that vision is performed by <i>rays</i> which
proceed in straight lines, and that these rays are <i>reflected</i> by
certain surfaces (mirrors) in such manner that the angles which they
make with the surface on each side are equal. They drew various
conclusions from these premises by the aid of geometry; as, for
instance, the convergence of rays which fall on a concave
speculum.</p>
<p>It may be observed that the <i>Idea</i> which is here introduced,
is that of visual <i>rays</i>, or lines along which vision is produced
and light carried. This idea once clearly apprehended, it was not
difficult to show that these lines are straight lines, both in the
case of light and of sight. In the beginning of Euclid’s “Treatise on
Optics,” some of the arguments are mentioned by which this was
established. We are told in the Proem, “In explaining what concerns
the sight, he adduced certain arguments from which he inferred that
all light is carried in straight lines. The greatest proof of this is
shadows, and the bright spots which are produced by light coming
through windows and cracks, and which could not be, except the rays of
the sun were carried in straight lines. So in fires, the shadows are
greater than the bodies if the fire be small, but less than the bodies
if the fire be greater.” A clear comprehension of the principle would
lead to the perception of innumerable proofs of its truth on every
side.</p>
<p>The Law of Equality of Angles of Incidence and Reflection was not
quite so easy to verify; but the exact resemblance of the object and
its image in a plane mirror, (as the surface of still water, for
instance), which is a consequence of this law, would afford convincing
evidence of its truth in that case, and would be confirmed by the
examination of other cases. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page101">101</a></span></p>
<p>With these true principles was mixed much error and indistinctness,
even in the best writers. Euclid, and the Platonists, maintained that
vision is exercised by rays proceeding <em>from</em> the eye, not
<em>to</em> it; so that when we see objects, we learn their form as a
blind man would do, by feeling it out with his staff. This mistake,
however, though Montucla speaks severely of it, was neither very
discreditable nor very injurious; for the mathematical conclusions on
each supposition are necessarily the same. Another curious and false
assumption is, that those visual rays are not close together, but
separated by intervals, like the fingers when the hand is spread. The
motive for this invention was the wish to account for the fact, that
in looking for a small object, as a needle, we often cannot see it
when it is under our nose; which it was conceived would be impossible
if the visual rays reached to all points of the surface before us.</p>
<p>These errors would not have prevented the progress of the science.
But the Aristotelian physics, as usual, contained speculations more
essentially faulty. Aristotle’s views led him to try to describe the
kind of causation by which vision is produced, instead of the laws by
which it is exercised; and the attempt consisted, as in other
subjects, of indistinct principles, and ill-combined facts. According
to him, vision must be produced by a Medium,&#8212;by something
<em>between</em> the object and the eye,&#8212;for if we press the
object on the eye, we do not see it; this Medium is Light, or “the
transparent in action;” darkness occurs when the transparency is
potential, not actual; color is not the “absolute visible,” but
something which is <em>on</em> the absolute visible; color has the
power of setting the transparent in action; it is not, however, all
colors that are seen by means of light, but only the proper color of
each object; for some things, as the heads, and scales, and eyes of
fish, are seen in the dark; but they are not seen with their proper
color.<a id="fnanchor1-2" href="#note1-2"><span
class="fnanchor">1</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-2"
href="#fnanchor1-2">1</a></span> De Anim. ii. <span class="correction" title="emended from 6">7</span>.</div>
<p>In all this there is no steady adherence either to one notion, or
to one class of facts. The distinction of Power and Act is introduced
to modify the Idea of Transparency, according to the formula of the
school; then Color is made to be something unknown in addition to
Visibility; and the distinction of “proper” and “improper” colors is
assumed, as sufficient to account for a phenomenon. Such
classifications have in them nothing of which the mind can take steady
hold; nor is it difficult to see that they do not come under those
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page102">102</a></span> conditions of
successful physical speculation, which we have laid down.</p>
<p>It is proper to notice more distinctly the nature of the
Geometrical Propositions contained in Euclid’s work. The <i>Optica</i>
contains Propositions concerning Vision and Shadows, derived from the
principle that the rays of light are rectilinear: for instance, the
Proposition that the shadow is greater than the object, if the
illuminating body be less and <i>vice versa</i>. The <i>Catoptrica</i>
contains Propositions concerning the effects of Reflection, derived
from the principle that the Angles of Incidence and Reflection are
equal: as, that in a convex mirror the object appears convex, and
smaller than the object. We see here an example of the promptitude of
the Greeks in deduction. When they had once obtained a knowledge of a
principle, they followed it to its mathematical consequences with
great acuteness. The subject of concave mirrors is pursued further in
Ptolemy’s <i>Optics</i>.</p>
<p>The Greek writers also cultivated the subject of <i>Perspective</i>
speculatively, in mathematical treatises, as well as practically, in
pictures. The whole of this theory is a consequence of the principle
that vision takes place in straight lines drawn from the object to the
eye.</p>
<p id="refraction">“The ancients were in some measure acquainted with
the Refraction as well as the Reflection of Light,” as I have shown in
Book <span class="sc">ix</span>. Chap. 2 [2d Ed.] of the
<i>Philosophy</i>. The current knowledge on this subject must have
been very slight and confused; for it does not appear to have enabled
them to account for one of the simplest results of Refraction, the
magnifying effect of convex transparent bodies. I have noticed in the
passage just referred to, Seneca’s crude notions on this subject; and
in like manner Ptolemy in his <i>Optics</i> asserts that an object
placed in water must always appear larger then when taken out.
Aristotle uses the term ἀνακλάσις (<i>Meteorol</i>. iii. 2), but
apparently in a very vague manner. It is not evident that he
distinguished Refraction from Reflection. His Commentators however do
distinguish these as διακλάσις and ἀνακλάσις. See <span
class="correction" title="emended from Olympiodorusin">Olympiodorus
in</span> Schneider’s <i>Eclogæ Physicæ</i>, vol. i. p. 397. And
Refraction had been the subject of special attention among the Greek
Mathematicians. Archimedes had noticed (as we learn from the same
writer) that in certain cases, a ring which cannot be seen over the
edge of the empty vessel in which it is placed, becomes visible when
the vessel is filled with water. The same fact is stated in the
<i>Optics</i> of Euclid. We do not find this fact explained in that
work as we now have it; but in Ptolemy’s <i>Optics</i> the fact is
explained by a flexure of the visual ray: it is <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page103">103</a></span> noticed that this
flexure is different at different angles from the perpendicular, and
there is an elaborate collection of measures of the flexure at
different angles, made by means of an instrument devised for the
purpose. There is also a collection of similar measures of the
refraction when the ray passes from air to glass, and when it passes
from glass to water. This part of Ptolemy’s work is, I think, the
oldest extant example of a collection of experimental measures in any
other subject than astronomy; and in astronomy our measures are the
result of <em>observation</em> rather than of <em>experiment</em>. As
Delambre says (<i>Astron. Anc.</i> vol. ii. p. 427), “On y voit des
expériences de physique bien faites, ce qui est sans exemple chez les
anciens.”</p>
<p>Ptolemy’s Optical work was known only by Roger Bacon’s references
to it (<i>Opus Majus</i>, p. 286, &amp;c.) till 1816; but copies of
Latin translations of it were known to exist in the Royal Library at
Paris, and in the Bodleian at Oxford. Delambre has given an account of
the contents of the Paris copy in his <i>Astron. Anc.</i> ii. 414, and
in the <i>Connoissance des Temps</i> for 1816; and Prof. Rigaud’s
account of the Oxford copy is given in the article <i>Optics</i>, in
the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>. Ptolemy shows great sagacity in
applying the notion of Refraction to the explanation of the
displacement of astronomical objects which is produced by the
atmosphere,&#8212;<i>Astronomical Refraction</i>, as it is commonly
called. He represents the visual ray as refracted in passing from the
<i>ether</i>, which is above the air, into the air; the air being
bounded by a spherical surface which has for its centre “the centre of
all the elements, the centre of the earth;” and the refraction being a
flexure towards the line drawn perpendicular to this surface. He thus
constructs, says Delambre, the same figure on which Cassini afterwards
founded the whole of his theory; and gives a theory more complete than
that of any astronomer previous to him. Tycho, for instance, believed
that astronomical refraction was caused only by the <em>vapors</em> of
the atmosphere, and did not exist above the altitude of 45°.</p>
<p>Cleomedes, about the time of Augustus, had guessed at Refraction,
as an explanation of an eclipse in which the sun and moon are both
seen at the same time. “Is it not possible,” he says, “that the ray
which proceeds from the eye and traverses moist and cloudy air may
bend downwards to the sun, even when he is below the horizon?” And
Sextus Empiricus, a century later, says, “The air being dense, by the
refraction of the visual ray, a constellation may be seen above the
horizon when it is yet below the horizon.” But from what follows, it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page104">104</a></span> appears
doubtful whether he clearly distinguished Refraction and
Reflection.</p>
<p>In order that we may not attach too much value to the vague
expressions of Cleomedes and Sextus Empiricus, we may remark that
Cleomedes conceives such an eclipse as he describes not to be
possible, though he offers an explanation of it if it be: (the fact
must really occur whenever the moon is seen in the horizon in the
middle of an eclipse:) and that Sextus Empiricus gives his suggestion
of the effect of refraction as an argument why the Chaldean astrology
cannot be true, since the constellation which appears to be rising at
the moment of a birth is not the one which is truly rising. The
Chaldeans might have answered, says Delambre, that the star begins to
shed its influence, not when it is really in the horizon, but when its
light is seen. (<i>Ast. Anc.</i> vol. i. p. 231, and vol. ii. p.
548.)</p>
<p>It has been said that Vitellio, or Vitello, whom we shall <a
href="#b9-2">hereafter</a> have to speak of in the history of Optics,
took his Tables of Refractions from Ptolemy. This is contrary to what
Delambre states. He says that Vitello may be accused of plagiarism
from Alhazen, and that Alhazen did not borrow his Tables from Ptolemy.
Roger Bacon had said (<i>Opus Majus</i>, p. 288), “Ptolemæus in libro
de Opticis, id est, de Aspectibus, seu in Perspectivâ suâ, qui prius
quam Alhazen dedit hanc sententiam, quam a Ptolemæo acceptam Alhazen
exposuit.” This refers only to the opinion that visual rays proceed
from the eye. But this also is erroneous; for Alhazen maintains the
contrary: “Visio fit radiis a visibili extrinsecus ad visum
manantibus.” (<i>Opt.</i> Lib. i. cap. 5.) Vitello says of his Table
of Refractions, “Acceptis instrumentaliter, prout potuimus
propinquius, angulis omnium refractionum . . . invenimus quod semper
iidem sunt anguli refractionum: . . . secundum hoc fecimus has
tabulas.” “Having measured, by means of instruments, as exactly as we
could, the whole range of the angles of refraction, we found that the
refraction is always the same for the same angle; and hence we have
constructed these Tables.”  ~Additional material in the <a

<span class="sc">Earliest Stages of Harmonics.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">AMONG</span> the ancients, the
science of Music was an application of Arithmetic, as Optics and
Mechanics were of Geometry. The story which is told concerning the
origin of their arithmetical music, is the following, as it stands in
the Arithmetical Treatise of Nicomachus.</p>
<p>Pythagoras, walking one day, meditating on the means of measuring
musical notes, happened to pass near a blacksmith’s shop, and had his
attention arrested by hearing the hammers, as they struck the anvil,
produce the sounds which had a musical relation to each other. On
listening further, he found that the intervals were a Fourth, a Fifth,
and an Octave; and on weighing the hammers, it appeared that the one
which gave the Octave was <i>one-half</i> the heaviest, the one which
gave the Fifth was <i>two-thirds</i>, and the one which gave the
Fourth was <i>three-quarters</i>. He returned home, reflected upon
this phenomenon, made trials, and finally discovered, that if he
stretched musical strings of equal lengths, by weights which have the
proportion of one-half, two-thirds, and three-fourths, they produced
intervals which were an Octave, a Fifth, and a Fourth. This
observation gave an arithmetical measure of the principal Musical
Intervals, and made Music an arithmetical subject of speculation.</p>
<p>This story, if not entirely a philosophical fable, is undoubtedly
inaccurate; for the musical intervals thus spoken of would not be
produced by striking with hammers of the weights there stated. But it
is true that the notes of strings have a definite relation to the
forces which stretch them; and this truth is still the groundwork of
the theory of musical concords and discords.</p>
<p>Nicomachus says that Pythagoras found the weights to be, as I have
mentioned, in the proportion of 12, 6, 8, 9; and the intervals, an
Octave, corresponding to the proportion 12 to 6, or 2 to 1; a Fifth,
corresponding to the proportion 12 to 8, or 3 to 2; and a Fourth,
corresponding to the proportion 12 to 9, or 4 to 3. There is no doubt
that this statement of the ancient writer is inexact as to the
physical fact, for the rate of vibration of a string, on which its
note depends, is, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page106">106</a></span> other things being equal, not as the
weight, but as the square root of the weight. But he is right as to
the essential point, that those ratios of 2 to 1, 3 to 2, and 4 to 3,
are the characteristic ratios of the Octave, Fifth, and Fourth. In
order to produce these intervals, the appended weights must be, not as
12, 9, 8, and 6, but as 12, 6¾, 5⅓, and 3.</p>
<p>The numerical relations of the other intervals of the musical
scale, as well as of the Octave, Fifth, and Fourth, were discovered by
the Greeks. Thus they found that the proportion in a Major Third was 5
to 4; in a Minor Third, 6 to 5; in a Major Tone, 9 to 8; in a Semitone
or <i>Diesis</i>, 16 to 15. They even went so far as to determine the
<i>Comma</i>, in which the interval of two notes is so small that they
are in the proportion of 81 to 80. This is the interval between two
notes, each of which may be called the Seventeenth above the
key-note;&#8212;the one note being obtained by ascending a Fifth four
times over; the other being obtained by ascending through two Octaves
and a Major Third. The want of exact coincidence between these two
notes is an inherent arithmetical imperfection in the musical scale,
of which the consequences are very extensive.</p>
<p>The numerical properties of the musical scale were worked out to a
very great extent by the Greeks, and many of their Treatises on this
subject remain to us. The principal ones are the seven authors
published by Meibomius.<a id="fnanchor2-2" href="#note2-2"><span
class="fnanchor">2</span></a> These arithmetical elements of Music are
to the present day important and fundamental portions of the Science
of Harmonics.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note2-2"
href="#fnanchor2-2">2</a></span> <i>Antiquæ Musicæ Scriptores
septem</i>, 1652.</div>
<p>It may at first appear that the truth, or even the possibility of
this history, by referring the discovery to accident, disproves our
doctrine, that this, like all other fundamental discoveries, required
a distinct and well-pondered Idea as its condition. In this, however,
as in all cases of supposed accidental discoveries in science, it will
be found, that it was exactly the possession of such an Idea which
made the accident possible.</p>
<p>Pythagoras, assuming the truth of the tradition, must have had an
exact and ready apprehension of those relations of musical sounds,
which are called respectively an Octave, a Fifth, and a Fourth. If he
had not been able to conceive distinctly this relation, and to
apprehend it when heard, the sounds of the anvil would have struck his
ears to no more purpose than they did those of the smiths themselves.
He <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page107">107</a></span> must have
had, too, a ready familiarity with numerical ratios; and, moreover
(that in which, probably, his superiority most consisted), a
disposition to connect one notion with the other&#8212;the musical
relation with the arithmetical, if it were found possible. When the
connection was once suggested, it was easy to devise experiments by
which it might be confirmed.</p>
<p>“The philosophers of the Pythagorean School,<a id="fnanchor3-2"
href="#note3-2"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a> and in particular,
Lasus of Hermione, and Hippasus of Metapontum, made many such
experiments upon strings; varying both their lengths and the weights
which stretched them; and also upon vessels filled with water, in a
greater or less degree.” And thus was established that connection of
the Idea with the Fact, which this Science, like all others,
requires.</p>

<hr class="one" />
<p>I shall quit the Physical Sciences of Ancient Greece, with the
above brief statement of the discovery of the fundamental principles
which they involved; not only because such initial steps must always
be the most important in the progress of science, but because, in
reality, the Greeks made no advances beyond these. There took place
among them no additional inductive processes, by which new facts were
brought under the dominion of principles, or by which principles were
presented in a more comprehensive shape than before. Their advance
terminated in a single stride. Archimedes had stirred the intellectual
world, but had not put it in progressive motion: the science of
Mechanics stopped where he left it. And though, in some objects, as in
Harmonics, much was written, the works thus produced consisted of
deductions from the fundamental principles, by means of arithmetical
calculations; occasionally modified, indeed, by reference to the
pleasures which music, as an art, affords, but not enriched by any new
scientific truths.</p>
<p>[3d Ed.] We should, however, quit the philosophy of the ancient
Greeks without a due sense of the obligations which Physical Science
in all succeeding ages owes to the acute and penetrating spirit in
which their inquiries in that region of human knowledge were
conducted, and to the large and lofty aspirations which were
displayed, even in their failure, if we did not bear in mind both the
multifarious and comprehensive character of their attempts, and some
of the causes which limited their progress in positive science. They
speculated and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page108">108</a></span>
theorized under a lively persuasion that a Science of every part of
nature was possible, and was a fit object for the exercise of man’s
best faculties; and they were speedily led to the conviction that such
a science must clothe its conclusions in the language of mathematics.
This conviction is eminently conspicuous in the writings of Plato. In
the <i>Republic</i>, in the <i>Epinomis</i>, and above all in the
<i>Timæus</i>, this conviction makes him return, again and again, to a
discussion of the laws which had been established or conjectured in
his time, respecting Harmonics and Optics, such as we have seen, and
still more, respecting Astronomy, such as we shall see in the next
Book. Probably no succeeding step in the discovery of the Laws of
Nature was of so much importance as the full adoption of this
pervading conviction, that there must be Mathematical Laws of Nature,
and that it is the business of Philosophy to discover these Laws. This
conviction continues, through all the succeeding ages of the history
of science, to be the animating and supporting principle of scientific
investigation and discovery. And, especially in Astronomy, many of the
erroneous guesses which the Greeks made, contain, if not the germ, at
least the vivifying life-blood, of great truths, reserved for future
ages.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Greeks not only sought such theories of special parts
of nature, but a general Theory of the Universe. An essay at such a
theory is the <i>Timæus</i> of Plato; too wide and too ambitious an
attempt to succeed at that time; or, indeed, on the scale on which he
unfolds it, even in our time; but a vigorous and instructive example
of the claim which man’s Intellect feels that it may make to
understand the universal frame of things, and to render a reason for
all that is presented to it by the outward senses.</p>
<p class="end">Further; we see in Plato, that one of the grounds of
the failure in this attempt, was the assumption that the <em>reason
why</em> every thing is what it is and as it is, must be that so it is
<em>best</em>, according to some view of better or worse attainable by
man. Socrates, in his dying conversation, as given in the
<i>Phædo</i>, declares this to have been what he sought in the
philosophy of his time; and tells his friends that he turned away from
the speculations of Anaxagoras because they did not give him such
reasons for the constitution of the world; and Plato’s <i>Timæus</i>
is, in reality, an attempt to supply this deficiency, and to present a
Theory of the Universe, in which every thing is accounted for by such
reasons. Though this is a failure, it is a noble as well as an
instructive failure.   ~Additional material in the <a

<h3 class="space-above">INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> earliest and fundamental
conceptions of men respecting the objects with which Astronomy is
concerned, are formed by familiar processes of thought, without
appearing to have in them any thing technical or scientific. Days,
Years, Months, the Sky, the Constellations, are notions which the most
uncultured and incurious minds possess. Yet these are elements of the
Science of Astronomy. The reasons why, in this case alone, of all the
provinces of human knowledge, men were able, at an early and
unenlightened period, to construct a science out of the obvious facts
of observation, with the help of the common furniture of their minds,
will be more apparent in the course of the philosophy of science: but
I may here barely mention two of these reasons. They are, first, that
the familiar act of thought, exercised for the common purposes of
life, by which we give to an assemblage of our impressions such a
unity as is implied in the above notions and terms, a Month, a Year,
the Sky, and the like, is, in reality, an <em>inductive act</em>, and
shares the nature of the processes by which all sciences are formed;
and, in the next place, that the ideas appropriate to the induction in
this case, are those which, even in the least cultivated minds, are
very clear and definite; namely, the ideas of Space and Figure, Time
and Number, Motion and Recurrence. Hence, from their first origin, the
modifications of those ideas assume a scientific form.</p>
<p>We must now trace in detail the peculiar course which, in
consequence of these causes, the knowledge of man respecting the
heavenly bodies took, from the earliest period of his history. <span

<span class="sc">Earliest Stages of Astronomy.</span></h3>
<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Formation of the Notion of a
Year.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> notion of a <i>Day</i> is
early and obviously impressed upon man in almost any condition in
which we can imagine him. The recurrence of light and darkness, of
comparative warmth and cold, of noise and silence, of the activity and
repose of animals;&#8212;the rising, mounting, descending, and setting
of the sun;&#8212;the varying colors of the clouds, generally,
notwithstanding their variety, marked by a daily progression of
appearances;&#8212;the calls of the desire of food and of sleep in man
himself, either exactly adjusted to the period of this change, or at
least readily capable of being accommodated to it;&#8212;the
recurrence of these circumstances at intervals, equal, so far as our
obvious judgment of the passage of time can decide; and these
intervals so short that the repetition is noticed with no effort of
attention or memory;&#8212;this assemblage of suggestions makes the
notion of a Day necessarily occur to man, if we suppose him to have
the conception of Time, and of Recurrence. He naturally marks by a
term such a portion of time, and such a cycle of recurrence; he calls
each portion of time, in which this series of appearances and
occurrences come round, a <i>Day</i>; and such a group of particulars
are considered as appearing or happening <em>in</em> the same day.</p>
<p><i>A Year</i> is a notion formed in the same manner; implying in
the same way the notion of recurring facts; and also the faculty of
arranging facts in time, and of appreciating their recurrence. But the
notion of a Year, though undoubtedly very obvious, is, on many
accounts, less so than that of a Day. The repetition of similar
circumstances, at equal intervals, is less manifest in this case, and
the intervals being much longer, some exertion of memory becomes
requisite in order that the recurrence may be perceived. A child might
easily be persuaded that successive years were of unequal length; or,
if the summer were cold, and the spring and autumn warm, might be made
to believe, if all who spoke in its hearing agreed to support the
delusion, that one year was two. It would be impossible to practise
such a deception with regard to the day, without the use of some
artifice beyond mere words. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page113">113</a></span></p>
<p>Still, the recurrence of the appearances which suggest the notion
of a Year is so obvious, that we can hardly conceive man without it.
But though, in all climes and times, there would be a recurrence, and
at the same interval in all, the recurring appearances would be
extremely different in different countries; and the contrasts and
resemblances of the seasons would be widely varied. In some places the
winter utterly alters the face of the country, converting grassy
hills, deep leafy woods of various hues of green, and running waters,
into snowy and icy wastes, and bare snow-laden branches; while in
others, the field retains its herbage, and the tree its leaves, all
the year; and the rains and the sunshine alone, or various
agricultural employments quite different from ours, mark the passing
seasons. Yet in all parts of the world the yearly cycle of changes has
been singled out from all others, and designated by a peculiar name.
The inhabitant of the equatorial regions has the sun vertically over
him at the end of every period of six months, and similar trains of
celestial phenomena fill up each of these intervals, yet we do not
find years of six months among such nations. The Arabs alone,<a
id="fnanchor1-3" href="#note1-3"><span class="fnanchor">1</span></a>
who practise neither agriculture nor navigation, have a year depending
upon the moon only; and borrow the word from other languages, when
they speak of the solar year.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-3"
href="#fnanchor1-3">1</a></span> Ideler, <i>Berl. Trans.</i> 1813, p.
51.</div>
<p>In general, nations have marked this portion of time by some word
which has a reference to the returning circle of seasons and
employments. Thus the Latin <i>annus</i> signified a ring, as we see
in the derivative <i>annulus</i>: the Greek term ἐνιαυτὸς implies
something which <i>returns into itself</i>: and the word as it exists
in Teutonic languages, of which our word <i>year</i> is an example, is
said to have its origin in the word <i>yra</i> which means a ring in
Swedish, and is perhaps connected with the Latin <i>gyrus</i>.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Fixation of the Civil Year.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> year, considered as a recurring cycle
of seasons and of general appearances, must attract the notice of man
as soon as his attention and memory suffice to bind together the parts
of a succession of the length of several years. But to make the same
term imply a certain fixed number of days, we must know how many days
the cycle of the seasons occupies; a knowledge which requires
faculties and artifices beyond what we have already mentioned. For
instance, men cannot reckon as far as any number at all approaching
the number of days in the year, without possessing a system of numeral
terms, and methods <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page114">114</a></span> of practical numeration on which such a
system of terms is always founded.<a id="fnanchor2-3"
href="#note2-3"><span class="fnanchor">2</span></a> The South American
Indians, the Koussa Caffres and Hottentots, and the natives of New
Holland, all of whom are said to be unable to reckon further than the
fingers of their hands and feet,<a id="fnanchor3-3"
href="#note3-3"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a> cannot, as we do,
include in their notion of a year the fact of its consisting of 365
days. This fact is not likely to be known to any nation except those
which have advanced far beyond that which may be considered as the
earliest scientific process which we can trace in the history of the
human race, the formation of a method of designating the successive
numbers to an indefinite extent, by means of names, framed according
to the decimal, quinary, or vigenary scale.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note2-3"

href="#fnanchor3-3">3</a></span> Ibid. Art. 32.</div>
<p>But even if we suppose men to have the habit of recording the
passage of each day, and of counting the score thus recorded, it would
be by no means easy for them to determine the exact number of days in
which the cycle of the seasons recurs; for the indefiniteness of the
appearances which mark the same season of the year, and the changes to
which they are subject as the seasons are early or late, would leave
much uncertainty respecting the duration of the year. They would not
obtain any accuracy on this head, till they had attended for a
considerable time to the motions and places of the sun; circumstances
which require more precision of notice than the general facts of the
degrees of heat and light. The motions of the sun, the succession of
the places of his rising and setting at different times of the year,
the greatest heights which he reaches, the proportion of the length of
day and night, would all exhibit several cycles. The turning back of
the sun, when he had reached the greatest distance to the south or to
the north, as shown either by his rising or by his height at noon,
would perhaps be the most observable of such circumstances.
Accordingly the τροπαὶ ἠελίοιο, the turnings of the sun, are used
repeatedly by Hesiod as a mark from which he reckons the seasons of
various employments. “Fifty days,” he says, “after the turning of the
sun, is a seasonable time for beginning a voyage.”<a id="fnanchor4-3"

<p class="above" style="clear:both">The phenomena would be different
in different climates, but the recurrence would be common to all. Any
one of these kinds of phenomena, noted with moderate care for a year,
would show what was the number of days of which a year consisted; and
if several years <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page115">115</a></span> were included in the interval through
which the scrutiny extended, the knowledge of the length of the year
so acquired would be proportionally more exact.</p>
<p>Besides those notices of the sun which offered exact indications of
the seasons, other more indefinite natural occurrences were used; as
the arrival of the swallow (χελιδών) and the kite (ἰκτίν), The birds,
in Aristophanes’ play of that name, mention it as one of their offices
to mark the seasons; Hesiod similarly notices the cry of the crane as
an indication of the departure of winter.<a id="fnanchor5-3"

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note5-3"

<p>Among the Greeks the seasons were at first only summer and winter
(θέρος and χειμών), the latter including all the rainy and cold
portion of the year. The winter was then subdivided into the χειμών
and ἔαρ (winter proper and spring), and the summer, less definitely,
into θέρος and ὀπώρα (summer and autumn). Tacitus says that the
Germans knew neither the blessings nor the name of autumn, “Autumni
perinde nomen ac bona ignorantur.” Yet <i>harvest</i>, <i>herbst</i>,
is certainly an old German word.<a id="fnanchor6-3"

<p>In the same period in which the sun goes through his cycle of
positions, the stars also go through a cycle of appearances belonging
to them; and these appearances were perhaps employed at as early a
period as those of the sun, in determining the exact length of the
year. Many of the groups of fixed stars are readily recognized, as
exhibiting always the same configuration; and particular bright stars
are singled out as objects of attention. These are observed, at
particular seasons, to appear in the west after sunset; but it is
noted that when they do this, they are found nearer and nearer to the
sun every successive evening, and at last disappear in his light. It
is observed also, that at a certain interval after this, they rise
visibly before the dawn of day renders the stars invisible; and after
they are seen to do this, they rise every day at a longer interval
before the sun. The risings and settings of the stars under these
circumstances, or under others which are easily recognized, were, in
countries where the sky is usually clear, employed at an early period
to mark the seasons of the year. Eschylus<a id="fnanchor7-3"

id="fnanchor8-3" href="#note8-3"><span class="fnanchor">8</span></a>
of the Pleiades in the evening was a mark of the approach of winter.
The rising of the waters of the Nile in Egypt coincided with the
heliacal rising of Sirius, which star the Egyptians called Sothis.
Even without any artificial measure of time or position, it was not
difficult to carry observations of this kind to such a degree of
accuracy as to learn from them the number of days which compose the
year; and to fix the precise season from the appearance of the
stars.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note8-3"
href="#fnanchor8-3">8</a></span> Ideler (Chronol. i. 242) says that
<em>this</em> rising of the Pleiades took place at a time of the year
which corresponds to our 11th May, and the setting to the 20th
October; but this does not agree with the forty days of their being
“concealed,” which, from the context, must mean, I conceive, the
interval between their setting and rising. Pliny, however, says,
“Vergiliarum exortu æstas incipit, occasu hiems; <em>semestri</em>
spatio intra se messes vindemiasque et omnium maturitatem complexæ.”
(H. N. xviii. 69.)<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page117">117</a></span> By such

The priests informed him, he says, “that the Egyptians were the first
men who discovered the year, dividing it into twelve equal parts; and
this they asserted that they discovered from the stars.” Each of these
parts or months consisted of 30 days, and they added 5 days more at
the end of the year, “and thus the circle of the seasons come round.”
It seems, also, that the Jews, at an early period, had a similar
reckoning of time, for the Deluge which continued 150 days (Gen. vii.
24), is stated to have lasted from the 17th day of the second month
(Gen. vii. 11) to the 17th day of the seventh month (Gen. viii. 4),
that is, 5 months of 30 days.</p>

<p>A year thus settled as a period of a certain number of days is
called a <i>Civil Year</i>. It is one of the earliest discoverable
institutions of States possessing any germ of civilization; and one of
the earliest portions of human systematic knowledge is the discovery
of the length of the civil year, so that it should agree with the
natural year, or year of the seasons.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Correction of the Civil Year.</i>
(<i>Julian Calendar.</i>)</h4>
<p><span class="sc">In</span> reality, by such a mode of reckoning as
we have described, the circle of the seasons would not come round
exactly. The real length of the year is very nearly 365 days and a
quarter. If a year of 365 days were used, in four years the year would
begin a day too soon, when considered with reference to the sun and
stars; and in 60 years it would begin 15 days too soon: a quantity
perceptible to the loosest degree of attention. The civil year would
be found not to coincide with the year of the seasons; the beginning
of the former would take place at different periods of the latter; it
would <em>wander</em> into various seasons, instead of remaining fixed
to the same season; the term <i>year</i>, and any number of years,
would become ambiguous: some correction, at least some comparison,
would be requisite.</p>
<p>We do not know by whom the insufficiency of the year of 365 days
was first discovered;<a id="fnanchor14-3" href="#note14-3"><span
class="fnanchor">14</span></a> we find this knowledge diffused among
all civilized nations, and various artifices used in making the
correction. The method which we employ, and which consists in
reckoning an <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page118">118</a></span>
additional day at the end of February every fourth or <i>leap</i>
year, is an example of the principle of <i>intercalation</i>, by which
the correction was most commonly made. Methods of intercalation for
the same purpose were found to exist in the new world. The Mexicans
added 13 days at the end of every 52 years. The method of the Greeks
was more complex (by means of the <i>octaëteris</i> or cycle of 8
years); but it had the additional object of accommodating itself to
the motions of the moon, and therefore must be treated of hereafter.
The Egyptians, on the other hand, knowingly permitted their civil year
to <i>wander</i>, at least so far as their religious observances were
concerned. “They do not wish,” says Geminus,<a id="fnanchor15-3"
href="#note15-3"><span class="fnanchor">15</span></a> “the same
sacrifices of the gods to be made perpetually at the same time of the
year, but that they should go through all the seasons, so that the
same feast may happen in summer and winter, in spring and autumn.” The
period in which any festival would thus pass through all the seasons
of the year is 1461 years; for 1460 years of 365¼ days are equal to
1461 years of 365 days. This period of 1461 years is called the
<i>Sothic</i> Period, from Sothis, the name of the Dog-star, by which
their <em>fixed</em> year was determined; and for the same reason it
is called the <i>Canicular</i> Period.<a id="fnanchor16-3"
href="#note16-3"><span class="fnanchor">16</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note14-3"
href="#fnanchor14-3">14</a></span> Syncellus (<i>Chronographia</i>, p.

<p>Other nations did not regulate their civil year by intercalation at
short intervals, but rectified it by a <em>reform</em> when this
became necessary. The Persians are said to have added a month of 30
days every 120 years. The Roman calendar, at first very rude in its
structure, was reformed by Numa, and was directed to be kept in order
by the perpetual interposition of the augurs. This, however, was, from
various causes, not properly done; and the consequence was, that the
reckoning fell into utter disorder, in which state it was found by
Julius Cæsar, when he became dictator. By the advice of Sosigenes, he
adopted the mode of intercalation of one day in 4 years, which we
still retain; and in order to correct the derangement which had
already been produced, he added 90 days to a year of the usual length,
which thus became what was called <i>the year of confusion</i>. The
<i>Julian Calendar</i>, thus reformed, came into use, January 1, <span
class="sc">b. c.</span> 45.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 4.&#8212;<i>Attempts at the Fixation of the
Month.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> circle of changes through which the
moon passes in about thirty days, is marked, in the earliest stages of
language, by a word which implies the space of time which one such
circle occupies; just <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page119">119</a></span> as the circle of changes of the seasons
is designated by the word <i>year</i>. The lunar changes are, indeed,
more obvious to the sense, and strike a more careless person, than the
annual; the moon, when the sun is absent, is almost the sole natural
object which attracts our notice; and we look at her with a far more
tranquil and agreeable attention than we bestow on any other celestial
object. Her changes of form and place are definite and striking to all
eyes; they are uninterrupted, and the duration of their cycle is so
short as to require no effort of memory to embrace it. Hence it
appears to be more easy, and in earlier stages of civilization more
common, to count time by <em>moons</em> than by years.</p>
<p>The words by which this period of time is designated in various
languages, seem to refer us to the early history of language. Our word
<i>month</i> is connected with the word <i>moon</i>, and a similar
connection is noticeable in the other branches of the Teutonic. The
Greek word μὴν in like manner is related to μήνη, which though not the
common word for the moon, is found in Homer with that signification.
The Latin word <i>mensis</i> is probably connected with the same
group.<a id="fnanchor17-3" href="#note17-3"><span
class="fnanchor">17</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note17-3"
href="#fnanchor17-3">17</a></span> Cicero derives this word from the
verb <i>to measure</i>: “quia <i>mensa</i> spatia conficiunt,
<i>menses</i> nominantur;” and other etymologists, with similar views,
connect the above-mentioned words with the Hebrew <i>manah</i>, to
measure (with which the Arabic word <i>almanach</i> is connected).
Such a derivation would have some analogy with that of <i>annus</i>,
&amp;c., noticed <a href="#v1page113">above</a>: but if we are to
attempt to ascend to the earliest condition of language, we must
conceive it probable that men would have a name for a most conspicuous
visible object, <i>the moon</i>, before they would have a verb
denoting the very abstract and general notion, <i>to
measure</i>.</div>
<p>The month is not any exact number of days, being more than 29, and
less than 30. The latter number was first tried, for men more readily
select numbers possessing some distinction of regularity. It existed
for a long period in many countries. A very few months of 30 days,
however, would suffice to derange the agreement between the days of
the months and the moon’s appearance. A little further trial would
show that months of 29 and 30 days alternately, would preserve, for a
considerable period, this agreement.</p>
<p>The Greeks adopted this calendar, and, in consequence, considered
the days of their month as representing the changes of the moon: the
last day of the month was called ἔνη καὶ νέα, “the old and new” as
belonging to both the waning and the reappearing moon:<a
id="fnanchor18-3" href="#note18-3"><span
class="fnanchor">18</span></a> and their <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page120">120</a></span> festivals and sacrifices, as determined
by the calendar, were conceived to be necessarily connected with the
same periods of the cycles of the sun and moon. “The laws and the
oracles,” says Geminus, “which directed that they should in sacrifices
observe three things, months, days, years, were so understood.” With
this persuasion, a correct system of intercalation became a religious
duty.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note18-3"
href="#fnanchor18-3">18</a></span> Aratus says of the moon, in a
passage quoted by Geminus, p. 33:<div class="poem">

<p>The above rule of alternate months of 29 and 30 days, supposes the
length of the months 29 days and a half, which is not exactly the
length of a lunar month. Accordingly the Months and the Moon were soon
at variance. Aristophanes, in “The Clouds,” makes the Moon complain of
the disorder when the calendar was deranged.</p>

the cycle of Meton (spoken of in <a href="#v1p121Meton">Sect. 5</a>),
which had been done at Athens a few years before “The Clouds” was
acted.</div>
<p>The correction of this inaccuracy, however, was not pursued
separately, but was combined with another object, the securing a
correspondence between the lunar and solar years, the main purpose of
all early cycles.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 5.&#8212;<i>Invention of Lunisolar Years.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">There</span> are 12 complete lunations in a year;
which according to the above rule (of 29½ days to a lunation) would
make 354 days, leaving 12¼ days of difference between such a lunar
year and a solar year. It is said that, at an early period, this was
attempted to be corrected by interpolating a month of 30 days every
alternate year; and Herodotus<a id="fnanchor20-3"
href="#note20-3"><span class="fnanchor">20</span></a> relates a
conversation of Solon, implying a still ruder mode of <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page121">121</a></span> intercalation. This
can hardly be considered as an improvement in the Greek calendar
already described.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note20-3"
href="#fnanchor20-3">20</a></span> B. i. c. 15.</div>
<p>The first cycle which produced any near correspondence of the
reckoning of the moon and the sun, was the <i>Octaëteris</i>, or
period of 8 years: 8 years of 354 days, together with 3 months of 30
days each, making up (in 99 lunations) 2922 days; which is exactly the
amount of 8 years of 365¼ days each. Hence this period would answer
its purpose, so far as the above lengths of the lunar and solar cycles
are exact; and it might assume various forms, according to the manner
in which the three intercalary months were distributed. The customary
method was to add a thirteenth month at the end of the third, fifth,
and eighth year of the cycle. This period is ascribed to various
persons and times; probably different persons proposed different forms
of it. Dodwell places its introduction in the 59th Olympiad, or in the
6th century, <span class="sc">b. c.</span>: but Ideler thinks the
astronomical knowledge of the Greeks of that age was too limited to
allow of such a discovery.</p>
<p>This cycle, however, was imperfect. The duration of 99 lunations is
something more than 2922 days; it is more nearly 2923½; hence in 16
years there was a deficiency of 3 days, with regard to the motions of
the moon. This cycle of 16 years (<i>Heccædecaëteris</i>), with 3
interpolated days at the end, was used, it is said, to bring the
calculation right with regard to the moon; but in this way the origin
of the year was displaced with regard to the sun. After 10 revolutions
of this cycle, or 160 years, the interpolated days would amount to 30,
and hence the end of the lunar year would be a month in advance of the
end of the solar. By terminating the lunar year at the end of the
preceding month, the two years would again be brought into agreement:
and we have thus a cycle of 160 years.<a id="fnanchor21-3"
href="#note21-3"><span class="fnanchor">21</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note21-3"
href="#fnanchor21-3">21</a></span> Geminus. Ideler.</div>
<p>This cycle of 160 years, however, was calculated from the cycle of
16 years; and it was probably never used in civil reckoning; which the
others, or at least that of 8 years, appear to have been.</p>
<p id="v1p121Meton">The cycles of 16 and 160 years were corrections of
the cycle of 8 years; and were readily suggested, when the length of
the solar and lunar periods became known with accuracy. But a much
more exact cycle, independent of these, was discovered and introduced
by Meton,<a id="fnanchor22-3" href="#note22-3"><span
class="fnanchor">22</span></a> 432 years <span class="sc">b. c.</span>
This cycle consisted of 19 years, and is so correct and convenient,
that it is in use among ourselves to this day. The time occupied by 19
years, and by 235 lunations, is very nearly the same; <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page122">122</a></span> (the former time is
less than 6940 days by 9½ hours, the latter, by 7½ hours). Hence, if
the 19 years be divided into 235 months, so as to agree with the
changes of the moon, at the end of that period the same succession may
begin again with great exactness.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note22-3"
href="#fnanchor22-3">22</a></span> Ideler, <i>Hist. Unters.</i> p.
208.</div>
<p>In order that 235 months, of 30 and 29 days, may make up 6940 days,
we must have 125 of the former, which were called <i>full</i> months,
and 110 of the latter, which were termed <i>hollow</i>. An artifice
was used in order to distribute 110 hollow months among 6940 days. It
will be found that there is a hollow month for each 63 days nearly.
Hence if we reckon 30 days to every month, but at every 63d day leap
over a day in the reckoning, we shall, in the 19 years, omit 110 days;
and this accordingly was done. Thus the 3d day of the 3d month, the
6th day of the 5th month, the 9th day of the 7th, must be omitted, so
as to make these months “hollow.” Of the 19 years, seven must consist
of 13 months; and it does not appear to be known according to what
order these seven years were selected. Some say they were the 3d, 6th,
8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 19th; others, the 3d, 5th, 8th, 11th, 13th,
16th, and 19th.</p>
<p>The near coincidence of the solar and lunar periods in this cycle
of 19 years, was undoubtedly a considerable discovery at the time when
it was first accomplished. It is not easy to trace the way in which
such a discovery was made at that time; for we do not even know the
manner in which men then recorded the agreement or difference between
the calendar day and the celestial phenomenon which ought to
correspond to it. It is most probable that the length of the month was
obtained with some exactness by the observation of eclipses, at
considerable intervals of time from each other; for eclipses are very
noticeable phenomena, and must have been very soon observed to occur
only at new and full moon.<a id="fnanchor23-3" href="#note23-3"><span

<p>The exact length of a certain number of months being thus known,
the discovery of a cycle which should regulate the calendar with
sufficient accuracy would be a business of arithmetical skill, and
would depend, in part, on the existing knowledge of arithmetical
methods; but in making the discovery, a natural arithmetical sagacity
was probably more efficacious than method. It is very possible that
the <i>Cycle of Meton</i> is correct more nearly than its author was
aware, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page123">123</a></span>
nearly than he could ascertain from any evidence and calculation known
to him. It is so exact that it is still used in calculating the new
moon for the time of Easter; and the <i>Golden Number</i>, which is
spoken of in stating such rules, is the number of this Cycle
corresponding to the current year.<a id="fnanchor24-3"
href="#note24-3"><span class="fnanchor">24</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note24-3"
href="#fnanchor24-3">24</a></span> The same cycle of 19 years has been
used by the Chinese for a very great length of time; their civil year
consisting, like that of the Greeks, of months of 29 and 30 days. The
Siamese also have this period. (<i>Astron.</i> Lib. U. K.)</div>
<p>Meton’s Cycle was corrected a hundred years later (330 <span
class="sc">b. c.</span>), by Calippus, who discovered the error of it
by observing an eclipse of the moon six years before the death of
Alexander.<a id="fnanchor25-3" href="#note25-3"><span
class="fnanchor">25</span></a> In this corrected period, four cycles
of 19 years were taken, and a day left out at the end of the 76 years,
in order to make allowance for the hours by which, as already
observed, 6940 days are greater than 19 years, and than 235 lunations:
and this <i>Calippic period</i> is used in Ptolemy’s Almagest, in
stating observations of eclipses.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note25-3"
href="#fnanchor25-3">25</a></span> Delamb. <i>A. A.</i> p. 17.</div>
<p>The Metonic and Calippic periods undoubtedly imply a very
considerable degree of accuracy in the knowledge which the
astronomers, to whom they are due, had of the length of the month; and
the first is a very happy invention for bringing the solar and lunar
calendars into agreement.</p>
<p>The Roman Calendar, from which our own is derived, appears to have
been a much less skilful contrivance than the Greek; though scholars
are not agreed on the subject of its construction, we can hardly doubt
that months, in this as in other cases, were intended originally to
have a reference to the moon. In whatever manner the solar and lunar
motions were intended to be reconciled, the attempt seems altogether
to have failed, and to have been soon abandoned. The Roman months,
both before and after the Julian correction, were portions of the
year, having no reference to full and new moons; and we, having
adopted this division of the year, have thus, in our common calendar,
the traces of one of the early attempts of mankind to seize the law of
the succession of celestial phenomena, in a case where the attempt was
a complete failure.</p>
<p>Considered as a part of the progress of our astronomical knowledge,
improvements in the calendar do not offer many points to our
observation, but they exhibit a few very important steps. Calendars
which, belonging apparently to unscientific ages and nations, possess
a great degree of accordance with the true motions of the sun and moon
(like <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page124">124</a></span> the solar
calendar of the Mexicans, and the lunar calendar of the Greeks),
contain the only record now extant of discoveries which must have
required a great deal of observation, of thought, and probably of
time. The later improvements in calendars, which take place when
astronomical observation has been attentively pursued, are of little
consequence to the history of science; for they are generally founded
on astronomical determinations, and are posterior in time, and
inferior in accuracy, to the knowledge on which they depend. But
cycles of correction, which are both short and close to exactness,
like that of Meton, may perhaps be the original form of the knowledge
which they imply; and certainly require both accurate facts and
sagacious arithmetical reasonings. The discovery of such a cycle must
always have the appearance of a happy guess, like other discoveries of
laws of nature. Beyond this point, the interest of the study of
calendars, as bearing on our subject, ceases: they may be considered
as belonging rather to Art than to Science; rather as an application
of a part of our knowledge to the uses of life, than a means or an
evidence of its extension.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 6.&#8212;<i>The Constellations.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">Some</span> tendency to consider the stars as
formed into groups, is inevitable when men begin to attend to them;
but how men were led to the fanciful system of names of Stars and of
Constellations, which we find to have prevailed in early times, it is
very difficult to determine. Single stars, and very close groups, as
the Pleiades, were named in the time of Homer and Hesiod, and at a
still earlier period, as we find in the book of Job.<a
id="fnanchor26-3" href="#note26-3"><span

See Hyde, <i>Ulughbeigh</i>.</div>
<p>Two remarkable circumstances with respect to the Constellations
are, first, that they appear in most cases to be arbitrary
combinations; the artificial figures which are made to include the
stars, not having any resemblance to their obvious configurations; and
second, that these figures, in different countries, are so far
similar, as to imply some communication. The arbitrary nature of these
figures shows that they <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page125">125</a></span> were rather the work of the imaginative
and mythological tendencies of man, than of mere convenience and love
of arrangement. “The constellations,” says an astronomer of our own
time,<a id="fnanchor27-3" href="#note27-3"><span
class="fnanchor">27</span></a> “seem to have been almost purposely
named and delineated to cause as much confusion and inconvenience as
possible. Innumerable snakes twine through long and contorted areas of
the heavens, where no memory can follow them: bears, lions, and
fishes, large and small, northern and southern, confuse all
nomenclature. A better system of constellations might have been a
material help as an artificial memory.” When men indicate the stars by
figures, borrowed from obvious resemblances, they are led to
combinations quite different from the received constellations. Thus
the common people in our own country find a wain or wagon, or a
plough, in a portion of the great bear.<a id="fnanchor28-3"

<p>The similarity of the constellations recognized in different
countries is very remarkable. The Chaldean, the Egyptian, and the
Grecian skies have a resemblance which cannot be overlooked. Some have
conceived that this resemblance may be traced also in the Indian and
Arabic constellations, at least in those of the zodiac.<a
id="fnanchor29-3" href="#note29-3"><span

names and traditions connected with them are different, according to

the stars which the Greeks called the Eridanus, the Egyptians asserted

path along which the sun and moon pass, had its divisions marked by
signs which had a reference to the course of the seasons, to the
motion of the sun, or the employments of the husbandman. If we take
the position of the heavens, which, from the knowledge we now possess,
we are sure they must have had 15,000 years ago, the significance of
the signs of the zodiac, in which the sun was, as referred to the
Egyptian year, becomes very marked,<a id="fnanchor31-3"
href="#note31-3"><span class="fnanchor">31</span></a> and has led some
to suppose that the zodiac was invented at such a period. Others have
rejected this as an improbably great antiquity, and have thought it
more likely that the constellation assigned to each season was that
which, at that season, rose at the beginning of the night: <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page126">126</a></span> thus the balance
(which is conceived to designate the equality of days and nights) was
placed among the stars which rose in the evening when the spring
began: this would fix the origin of these signs 2500 years before our
era.</p>

<p>It is clear, as has already been said, that Fancy, and probably
Superstition, had a share in forming the collection of constellations.
It is certain that, at an early period, superstitious notions were
associated with the stars.<a id="fnanchor32-3" href="#note32-3"><span
class="fnanchor">32</span></a> Astrology is of very high antiquity in
the East. The stars were supposed to influence the character and
destiny of man, and to be in some way connected with superior natures
and powers.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note32-3"
href="#fnanchor32-3">32</a></span> Dupuis, vi. 546.</div>
<p>We may, I conceive, look upon the formation of the constellations,
and the notions thus connected with them, as a very early attempt to
find a meaning in the relations of the stars; and as an utter failure.
The first effort to associate the appearances and motions of the skies
by conceptions implying unity and connection, was made in a wrong
direction, as may very easily be supposed. Instead of considering the
appearances only with reference to space, time, number, in a manner
purely rational, a number of other elements, imagination, tradition,
hope, fear, awe of the supernatural, belief in destiny, were called
into action. Man, still young, as a philosopher at least, had yet to
learn what notions his successful guesses on these subjects must
involve, and what they must exclude. At that period, nothing could be
more natural or excusable than this ignorance; but it is curious to
see how long and how obstinately the belief lingered (if indeed it be
yet extinct) that the motions of the stars, and the dispositions and
fortunes of men, may come under some common conceptions and laws, by
which a connection between the one and the other may be
established.</p>
<p>We cannot, therefore, agree with those who consider Astrology in
the early ages as “only a degraded Astronomy, the abuse of a more
ancient science.”<a id="fnanchor33-3" href="#note33-3"><span
class="fnanchor">33</span></a> It was the first step to astronomy by
leading to habits and means of grouping phenomena; and, after a while,
by showing that pictorial and mythological relations among the stars
had no very obvious value. From that time, the inductive process went
on steadily in the true road, under the guidance of ideas of space,
time, and number.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 7.&#8212;<i>The Planets.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">While</span> men were becoming familiar with the
fixed stars, the planets must have attracted their notice. Venus, from
her brightness, and <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page127">127</a></span> from her accompanying the sun at no
great distance, and thus appearing as the morning and evening star,
was very conspicuous. Pythagoras is said to have maintained that the
evening and morning star are the same body, which certainly must have
been one of the earliest discoveries on this subject; and indeed we
can hardly conceive men noticing the stars for a year or two without
coming to this conclusion.</p>
<p>Jupiter and Mars, sometimes still brighter than Venus, were also
very noticeable. Saturn and Mercury were less so, but in fine climates
they and their motion would soon be detected by persons observant of
the heavens. To reduce to any rule the movements of these luminaries
must have taken time and thought; probably before this was done,
certainly very early, these heavenly bodies were brought more
peculiarly under those views which we have noticed as leading to
astrology.</p>
<p>At a time beyond the reach of certain history, the planets, along
with the sun and moon, had been arranged in a certain recognized order
by the Egyptians or some other ancient nation. Probably this
arrangement had been made according to the slowness of their motions
among the stars; for though the motion of each is very variable, the
gradation of their velocities is, on the whole, very manifest; and the
different rate of travelling of the different planets, and probably
other circumstances of difference, led, in the ready fancy of early
times, to the attribution of a peculiar character to each luminary.
Thus Saturn was held to be of a cold and gelid nature; Jupiter, who,
from his more rapid motion, was supposed to be lower in place, was
temperate; Mars, fiery, and the like.<a id="fnanchor34-3"

<p>It is not necessary to dwell on the details of these speculations,
but we may notice a very remarkable evidence of their antiquity and
generality in the structure of one of the most familiar of our
measures of time, the <i>Week</i>. This distribution of time according
to periods of seven days, comes down to us, as we learn from the
Jewish scriptures, from the beginning of man’s existence on the earth.
The same usage is found over all the East; it existed among the
Arabians, Assyrians, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page128">128</a></span> Egyptians.<a id="fnanchor35-3"
href="#note35-3"><span class="fnanchor">35</span></a> The same week is
found in India among the Bramins; it has there, also, its days marked
by those of the heavenly bodies; and it has been ascertained that the
same day has, in that country, the name corresponding with its
designation in other nations.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note35-3"
href="#fnanchor35-3">35</a></span> Laplace, <i>Hist. Astron.</i> p.
16.</div>
<p>The notion which led to the usual designations of the days of the
week is not easily unravelled. The days each correspond to one of the
heavenly bodies, which were, in the earliest systems of the world,
conceived to be the following, enumerating them in the order of their
remoteness from the earth:<a id="fnanchor36-3" href="#note36-3"><span
class="fnanchor">36</span></a> Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus,
Mercury, the Moon. At a later period, the received systems placed the
seven luminaries in <i>the seven spheres</i>. The knowledge which was
implied in this view, and the time when it was obtained, we must
consider <a href="#spheres">hereafter</a>. The order in which the
names are assigned to the days of the week (beginning with Saturday)
is, Saturn, the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus; and
various accounts are given of the manner in which one of these orders
is obtained from the other; all the methods proceeding upon certain
arbitrary arithmetical processes, connected in some way with
astrological views. It is perhaps not worth our while here to examine
further the steps of this process; it would be difficult to determine
with certainty why the former order of the planets was adopted, and
how and why the latter was deduced from it. But there is something
very remarkable in the universality of the notions, apparently so
fantastic, which have produced this result; and we may probably
consider the Week, with Laplace,<a id="fnanchor37-3"
href="#note37-3"><span class="fnanchor">37</span></a> as “the most
ancient monument of astronomical knowledge.” This period has gone on
without interruption or irregularity from the earliest recorded times
to our own days, traversing the extent of ages and the revolutions of
empires; the names of the ancient deities which were associated with
the stars have been replaced by those of the objects of the worship of
our Teutonic ancestors, according to their views of the correspondence
of the two mythologies; and the Quakers, in rejecting these names of
days, have cast aside the most ancient existing relic of astrological
as well as idolatrous superstition.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 8.&#8212;<i>The Circles of the Sphere.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> inventions hitherto noticed, though
undoubtedly they were steps in astronomical knowledge, can hardly be
considered as purely abstract and scientific speculations; for the
exact reckoning of time is one of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page129">129</a></span> the wants, even of the least civilized
nations. But the distribution of the places and motions of the
heavenly bodies by means of a celestial sphere with imaginary lines
drawn upon it, is a step in <em>speculative</em> astronomy, and was
occasioned and rendered important by the scientific propensities of
man.</p>
<p>It is not easy to say with whom this notion originated. Some parts
of it are obvious. The appearance of the sky naturally suggests the
idea of a concave Sphere, with the stars fixed on its surface. Their
motions during any one night, it would be readily seen, might be
represented by supposing this Sphere to turn round a Pole or Axis; for
there is a conspicuous star in the heavens which apparently stands
still (the Pole-star); all the others travel round this in circles,
and keep the same positions with respect to each other. This
stationary star is every night the same, and in the same place; the
other stars also have the same relative position; but their general
position at the same time of night varies gradually from night to
night, so as to go through its cycle of appearances once a year. All
this would obviously agree with the supposition that the sky is a
concave sphere or dome, that the stars have fixed places on this
sphere, and that it revolves perpetually and uniformly about the Pole
or fixed point.</p>
<p>But this supposition does not at all explain the way in which the
appearances of different nights succeed each other. This, however, may
be explained, it appears, by supposing the <em>sun</em> also <em>to
move among the stars</em> on the surface of the concave sphere. The
sun by his brightness makes the stars invisible which are on his side
of the heavens: this we can easily believe; for the moon, when bright,
also puts out all but the largest stars; and we see the stars
appearing in the evening, each in its place, according to their degree
of splendor, as fast as the declining light of day allows them to
become visible. And as the sun brings day, and his absence night, if
he move through the circuit of the stars in a year, we shall have, in
the course of that time, every part of the starry sphere in succession
presented to us as our nocturnal sky.</p>
<p>This notion, <em>that the sun moves round among the stars in a
year</em>, is the basis of astronomy, and a considerable part of the
science is only the development and particularization of this general
conception. It is not easy to ascertain either the exact method by
which the path of the sun among the stars was determined, or the
author and date of the discovery. That there is some difficulty in
tracing the course of the sun among the stars will be clearly seen,
when it is considered that no <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page130">130</a></span> star can ever be seen at the same time
with the sun. If the whole circuit of the sky be divided into twelve
parts or <i>signs</i>, it is estimated by Autolycus, the oldest writer
on these subjects whose works remain to us,<a id="fnanchor38-3"
href="#note38-3"><span class="fnanchor">38</span></a> that the stars
which occupy one of these parts are absorbed by the solar rays, so
that they cannot be seen. Hence the stars which are seen nearest to
the place of the setting and the rising sun in the evening and in the
morning, are distant from him by the half of a sign: the evening stars
being to the west, and the morning stars to the east of him. If the
observer had previously obtained a knowledge of the places of all the
principal stars, he might in this way determine the position of the
sun each night, and thus trace his path in a year.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note38-3"
href="#fnanchor38-3">38</a></span> Delamb. <i>A. A.</i> p. xiii.</div>
<p>In this, or some such way, the sun’s path was determined by the
early astronomers of Egypt. Thales, who is mentioned as the father of
Greek astronomy, probably learnt among the Egyptians the results of
such speculations, and introduced them into his own country. His
knowledge, indeed, must have been a great deal more advanced than that
which we are now describing, if it be true, as is asserted, that he
predicted an eclipse. But his having done so is not very consistent
with what we are told of the steps which his successors had still to
make.</p>
<p>The Circle of the Signs, in which the sun moves among the stars, is
obliquely situated with regard to the circles in which the stars move
about the poles. Pliny<a id="fnanchor39-3" href="#note39-3"><span
class="fnanchor">39</span></a> states that Anaximander,<a
id="fnanchor40-3" href="#note40-3"><span
class="fnanchor">40</span></a> a scholar of Thales, was the first
person who pointed out this obliquity, and thus, as he says, “opened
the gate of nature.” Certainly, the person who first had a clear view
of the nature of the sun’s path in the celestial sphere, made that
step which led to all the rest; but it is difficult to conceive that
the Egyptians and Chaldeans had not already advanced so far.</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note40-3"
href="#fnanchor40-3">40</a></span> Plutarch, <i>De Plac. Phil.</i>
lib. ii. cap. xii. says Pythagoras was the author of this
discovery.</div>
<p>The diurnal motion of the celestial sphere, and the motion of the
moon in the circle of the signs, gave rise to a mathematical science,
<i>the Doctrine of the Sphere</i>, which was one of the earliest
branches of applied mathematics. A number of technical conceptions and
terms were soon introduced. The <i>Sphere</i> of the heavens was
conceived to be complete, though we see but a part of it; it was
supposed to turn about the visible <i>pole</i> and another pole
opposite to this, and these poles were connected by an imaginary
<i>Axis</i>. The circle which divided the sphere exactly midway
between these poles was called the <i>Equator</i> (ἰσημέρινος). <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page131">131</a></span> The two circles
parallel to this which bounded the sun’s path among the stars were
called <i>Tropics</i> (τροπικαί), because the sun <em>turns</em> back
again towards the equator when he reaches them. The stars which never
set are bounded by a circle called the <i>Arctic Circle</i> (ἄρκτικος,
from ἄρκτος, the Bear, the constellation to which some of the
principal stars within that circle belong.) A circle about the
opposite pole is called <i>Antarctic</i>, and the stars which are
within it can never rise to us.<a id="fnanchor41-3"
href="#note41-3"><span class="fnanchor">41</span></a> The sun’s path
or circle of the signs is called the <i>Zodiac</i>, or circle of
animals; the points where this circle meets the equator are the
<i>Equinoctial Points</i>, the days and nights being equal when the
sun is in them; the <i>Solstitial Points</i> are those where the sun’s
path touches the tropics; his motion to the south or to the north
ceases when he is there, and he appears in that respect to stand
still. The <i>Colures</i> (κόλουροι, mutilated) are circles which pass
through the poles and through the equinoctial and solstitial points;
they have their name because they are only visible in part, a portion
of them being below the horizon.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note41-3"
href="#fnanchor41-3">41</a></span> The Arctic and Antarctic Circles of
modern astronomers are different from these.</div>
<p>The <i>Horizon</i> (ὁρίζων) is commonly understood as the boundary
of the visible earth and heaven. In the doctrine of the sphere, this
boundary is <i>a great circle</i>, that is, a circle of which the
plane passes through the centre of the sphere; and, therefore, an
entire hemisphere is always above the horizon. The term occurs for the
first time in the work of Euclid, called <i>Phænomena</i> (Φαινόμενα).
We possess two treatises written by Autolycus<a id="fnanchor42-3"
href="#note42-3"><span class="fnanchor">42</span></a> (who lived about
300 <span class="sc">b. c.</span>) which trace <i>deductively</i> the
results of the doctrine of the sphere. Supposing its diurnal motion to
be uniform, in a work entitled Περὶ Κινουμένης Σφαῖρας, “On the Moving
Sphere,” he demonstrates various properties of the diurnal risings,
settings, and motions of the stars. In another work, Περὶ Ἐπιτολῶν καὶ
Δύσεων, “On Risings and Settings,”<a id="fnanchor43-3"
href="#note43-3"><span class="fnanchor">43</span></a> <em>tacitly</em>
assuming the sun’s motion in his circle to be uniform, he proves
certain propositions, with regard to those risings and settings of the
stars, which take place at the same time when the sun rises and
sets,<a id="fnanchor44-3" href="#note44-3"><span
class="fnanchor">44</span></a> or <i>vice versâ</i>;<a
id="fnanchor45-3" href="#note45-3"><span
class="fnanchor">45</span></a> and also their <i>apparent</i> risings
and settings when they cease to be visible after sunset, or begin to
be visible after sunrise.<a id="fnanchor46-3" href="#note46-3"><span
class="fnanchor">46</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page132">132</a></span> Several of the propositions contained in
the former of these treatises are still necessary to be understood, as
fundamental parts of astronomy.</p>

<p>We may here remark the first instance of that which we shall find
abundantly illustrated in every part of the history of science; that
man is <em>prone</em> to become a deductive reasoner;&#8212;that as
soon as he obtains principles which can be traced to details by
logical consequence, he sets about forming a body of science, by
making a system of such reasonings. Geometry has always been a
favorite mode of exercising this propensity: and that science, along
with Trigonometry, Plane and Spherical, to which the early problems of
astronomy gave rise, have, up to the present day, been a constant
field for the exercise of mathematical ingenuity; a few simple
astronomical truths being assumed as the basis of the reasoning.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 9.&#8212;<i>The Globular Form of the Earth.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> establishment of the globular form of
the earth is an important step in astronomy, for it is the first of
those convictions, directly opposed to the apparent evidence of the
senses, which astronomy irresistibly proves. To make men believe that
<i>up</i> and <i>down</i> are different directions in different
places; that the sea, which seems so level, is, in fact, convex; that
the earth, which appears to rest on a solid foundation, is, in fact,
not supported at all; are great triumphs both of the power of
discovering and the power of convincing. We may readily allow this,
when we recollect how recently the doctrine of the <i>antipodes</i>,
or the existence of inhabitants of the earth, who stand on the
opposite side of it, with their feet turned towards ours, was
considered both monstrous and heretical.</p>
<p>Yet the different positions of the horizon at different places,
necessarily led the student of spherical astronomy towards this notion
of the earth as a round body. Anaximander<a id="fnanchor48-3"
href="#note48-3"><span class="fnanchor">48</span></a> is said by some
to have held the earth to be globular, and to be detached or
suspended; he is also stated to have constructed a sphere, on which
were shown the extent of land and water. As, however, we do not know
the arguments upon which he maintained the earth’s globular form, we
cannot judge of the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page133">133</a></span> value of his opinion; it may have been
no better founded than a different opinion ascribed to him by
Laertius, that the earth had the shape of a pillar. Probably, the
authors of the doctrine of the globular form of the earth were led to
it, as we have said, by observing the different height of the pole at
different places. They would find that the space which they passed
over from north to south on the earth, was proportional to the change
of place of the horizon in the celestial sphere; and as the horizon
is, at every place, in the direction of the earth’s apparently level
surface, this observation would naturally suggest to them the opinion
that the earth is placed within the celestial sphere, as a small globe
in the middle of a much larger one.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note48-3"
href="#fnanchor48-3">48</a></span> See Brucker, <i>Hist. Phil.</i>
vol. i. p. 486.</div>
<p>We find this doctrine so distinctly insisted on by Aristotle, that
we may almost look on him as the establisher of it.<a
id="fnanchor49-3" href="#note49-3"><span
class="fnanchor">49</span></a> “As to the figure of the earth, it must
necessarily be spherical.” This he proves, first by the tendency of
things, in all places, downwards. He then adds,<a id="fnanchor50-3"
href="#note50-3"><span class="fnanchor">50</span></a> “And, moreover,
from the phenomena according to the sense: for if it were not so, the
eclipses of the moon would not have such sections as they have. For in
the configurations in the course of a month, the deficient part takes
all different shapes; it is straight, and concave, and convex; but in
eclipses it always has the line of division convex; wherefore, since
the moon is eclipsed in consequence of the interposition of the earth,
the periphery of the earth must be the cause of this by having a
spherical form. And again, from the appearances of the stars, it is
clear, not only that the earth is round, but that its size is not very
large: for when we make a small removal to the south or the north, the
circle of the horizon becomes palpably different, so that the stars
overhead undergo a great change, and are not the same to those that
travel to the north and to the south. For some stars are seen in Egypt
or at Cyprus, but are not seen in the countries to the north of these;
and the stars that in the north are visible while they make a complete
circuit, there undergo a setting. So that from this it is manifest,
not only that the form of the earth is round, but also that it is a
part of not a very large sphere: for otherwise the difference would
not be so obvious to persons making so small a change of place.
Wherefore we may judge that those persons <em>who connect the region
in the neighborhood of the pillars of Hercules with that towards
India, and who assert that in this way the sea is</em> <span
class="sc">one</span>, do not assert things very improbable. They
confirm this conjecture moreover by the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page134">134</a></span> elephants, which are said to be of the
same species (γένος) towards each extreme; as if this circumstance was
a consequence of the conjunction of the extremes. The mathematicians,
who try to calculate the measure of the circumference, make it amount
to 400,000 stadia; whence we collect that the earth is not only
spherical, but is not large compared with the magnitude of the other
stars.”</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note50-3"
href="#fnanchor50-3">50</a></span> p. 291 C.</div>
<p>When this notion was once suggested, it was defended and confirmed
by such arguments as we find in later writers: for instance,<a
id="fnanchor51-3" href="#note51-3"><span
class="fnanchor">51</span></a> that the tendency of all things was to
fall to the place of heavy bodies, and that this place being the
centre of the earth, the whole earth had no such tendency; that the
inequalities on the surface were so small as not materially to affect
the shape of so vast a mass; that drops of water naturally form
themselves into figures with a convex surface; that the end of the
ocean would fall if it were not rounded off; that we see ships, when
they go out to sea, disappearing downwards, which shows the surface to
be convex. These are the arguments still employed in impressing the
doctrines of astronomy upon the student of our own days; and thus we
find that, even at the early period of which we are now speaking,
truths had begun to accumulate which form a part of our present
treasures.  ~Additional material in the <a href="#globe">3rd

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 10.&#8212;<i>The Phases of the Moon.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">When</span> men had formed a steady notion of the
Moon as a solid body, revolving about the earth, they had only further
to conceive it spherical, and to suppose the sun to be beyond the
region of the moon, and they would find that they had obtained an
explanation of the varying forms which the bright part of the moon
assumes in the course of a month. For the convex side of the
crescent-moon, and her full edge when she is gibbous, are always
turned towards the sun. And this explanation, once suggested, would be
confirmed, the more it was examined. For instance, if there be near us
a spherical stone, on which the sun is shining, and if we place
ourselves so that this stone and the moon are seen in the same
direction (the moon appearing just over the top of the stone), we
shall find that the visible part of the stone, which is then
illuminated by the sun, is exactly similar in form to the moon, at
whatever period of her changes she may be. The stone and the moon
being in the same position with respect to us, and both being
enlightened by the sun, the bright parts are the same in figure; <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page135">135</a></span> the only difference
is, that the dark part of the moon is usually not visible at all.</p>
<p>This doctrine is ascribed to Anaximander. Aristotle was fully aware
of it.<a id="fnanchor52-3" href="#note52-3"><span
class="fnanchor">52</span></a> It could not well escape the Chaldeans
and Egyptians, if they speculated at all about the causes of the
appearances in the heavens.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 11.&#8212;<i>Eclipses.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">Eclipses</span> of the sun and moon were from the
earliest tunes regarded with a peculiar interest. The notions of
superhuman influences and relations, which, as we have seen, were
associated with the luminaries of the sky, made men look with alarm at
any sudden and striking change in those objects; and as the constant
and steady course of the celestial revolutions was contemplated with a
feeling of admiration and awe, any marked interruption and deviation
in this course, was regarded with surprise and terror. This appears to
be the case with all nations at an early stage of their
civilization.</p>
<p>This impression would cause Eclipses to be noted and remembered;
and accordingly we find that the records of Eclipses are the earliest
astronomical information which we possess. When men had discovered
some of the laws of succession of other astronomical phenomena, for
instance, of the usual appearances of the moon and sun, it might then
occur to them that these unusual appearances also might probably be
governed by some rule.</p>
<p>The search after this rule was successful at an early period. The
Chaldeans were able to predict Eclipses of the Moon. This they did,
probably, by means of their Cycle of 223 months, or about 18 years;
for at the end of this time, the eclipses of the moon begin to return,
at the same intervals and in the same order as at the beginning.<a
id="fnanchor53-3" href="#note53-3"><span
class="fnanchor">53</span></a> Probably this was the first instance of
the prediction of peculiar astronomical phenomena. The Chinese have,
indeed, a legend, in which it is related that a solar eclipse happened
in the reign of Tchongkang, above 2000 years before Christ, and that
the emperor was so much irritated against two great officers of state,
who had neglected to predict this eclipse, that he put them to death.
But this cannot be accepted as a real event: for, during the next ten
centuries, we find no single observation or fact connected with
astronomy in the Chinese <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page136">136</a></span> histories; and their astronomy has never
advanced beyond a very rude and imperfect condition.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note53-3"
href="#fnanchor53-3">53</a></span> The eclipses of the sun are more
difficult to calculate; since they depend upon the place of the
spectator on the earth.</div>
<p>We can only conjecture the mode in which the Chaldeans discovered
their Period of 18 years; and we may make very different suppositions
with regard to the degree of science by which they were led to it. We
may suppose, with Delambre,<a id="fnanchor54-3" href="#note54-3"><span
class="fnanchor">54</span></a> that they carefully recorded the
eclipses which happened, and then, by the inspection of their
registers, discovered that those of the moon recurred after a certain
period. Or we may suppose, with other authors, that they sedulously
determined the motions of the moon, and having obtained these with
considerable accuracy, sought and found a period which should include
cycles of these motions. This latter mode of proceeding would imply a
considerable degree of knowledge.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note54-3"
href="#fnanchor54-3">54</a></span> <i>A. A.</i> p. 212.</div>
<p>It appears probable rather that such a period was discovered by
noticing the <em>recurrence</em> of eclipses, than by studying the
moon’s <em>motions</em>. After 6585⅓ days, or 223 lunations, the same
eclipses nearly will recur. It is not contested that the Chaldeans
were acquainted with this period, which they called <i>Saros</i>; or
that they calculated eclipses by means of it.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 12.&#8212;<i>Sequel to the Early Stages of
Astronomy.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">Every</span> stage of science has its train of
practical applications and systematic inferences, arising both from
the demands of convenience and curiosity, and from the pleasure which,
as we have already said, ingenuous and active-minded men feel in
exercising the process of deduction. The earliest condition of
astronomy, in which it can be looked upon as a science, exhibits
several examples of such applications and inferences, of which we may
mention a few.</p>
<p><i>Prediction of Eclipses.</i>&#8212;The Cycles which served to
keep in order the Calendar of the early nations of antiquity, in some
instances enabled them also, as has just been stated, to predict
Eclipses; and this application of knowledge necessarily excited great
notice. Cleomedes, in the time of Augustus, says, “We never see an
eclipse happen which has not been predicted by those who made use of
the Tables.” (ὑπὸ τῶν κανονικῶν.)</p>
<p><i>Terrestrial Zones.</i>&#8212;The globular form of the earth
being assented to, the doctrine of the sphere was applied to the earth
as well as the heavens; and the earth’s surface was divided by various
imaginary <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page137">137</a></span>
circles; among the rest, the equator, the tropics, and circles, at the
same distance from the poles as the tropics are from the equator. One
of the curious consequences of this division was the
<em>assumption</em> that there must be some marked difference in the
stripes or <i>zones</i> into which the earth’s surface was thus divided. In
going to the south, Europeans found countries hotter and hotter, in
going to the north, colder and colder; and it was supposed that the
space between the tropical circles must be uninhabitable from heat,
and that within the polar circles, again, uninhabitable from cold.
This fancy was, as we now know, entirely unfounded. But the principle
of the globular form of the earth, when dealt with by means of
spherical geometry, led to many true and important propositions
concerning the lengths of days and nights at different places. These
propositions still form a part of our Elementary Astronomy.</p>
<p><i>Gnomonic.</i>&#8212;Another important result of the doctrine of
the sphere was <i>Gnomonic</i> or <i>Dialling</i>. Anaximenes is said
by Pliny to have first taught this art in Greece; and both he and
Anaximander are reported to have erected the first dial at Lacedemon.
Many of the ancient dials remain to us; some of these are of complex
forms, and must have required great ingenuity and considerable
geometrical knowledge in their construction.</p>
<p><i>Measure of the Sun’s Distance.</i>&#8212;The explanation of the
phases of the moon led to no result so remarkable as the attempt of
Aristarchus of Samos to obtain from this doctrine a measure of the
Distance of the Sun as compared with that of the Moon. If the moon was
a perfectly smooth sphere, when she was exactly midway between the new
and full in position (that is, a quadrant from the sun), she would be
somewhat more than a half moon; and the place when she was
<i>dichotomized</i>, that is, was an exact semicircle, the bright part
being bounded by a straight line, would depend upon the sun’s distance
from the earth. Aristarchus endeavored to fix the exact place of this
Dichotomy; but the irregularity of the edge which bounds the bright
part of the moon, and the difficulty of measuring with accuracy, by
means then in use, either the precise time when the boundary was most
nearly a straight line, or the exact distance of the moon from the sun
at that time, rendered his conclusion false and valueless. He
collected that the sun is at 18 times the distance of the moon from
us; we now know that he is at 400 times the moon’s distance.</p>
<p>It would be easy to dwell longer on subjects of this kind; but we
have already perhaps entered too much in detail. We have been <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page138">138</a></span> tempted to do this by
the interest which the mathematical spirit of the Greeks gave to the
earliest astronomical discoveries, when these were the subjects of
their reasonings; but we must now proceed to contemplate them engaged
in a worthier employment, namely, in adding to these discoveries.

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Prelude to the Inductive Epoch of
Hipparchus.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">WITHOUT</span> pretending that we
have exhausted the consequences of the elementary discoveries which we
have enumerated, we now proceed to consider the nature and
circumstances of the next great discovery which makes an Epoch in the
history of Astronomy; and this we shall find to be the Theory of
Epicycles and Eccentrics. Before, however, we relate the establishment
of this theory, we must, according to the general plan we have marked
out, notice some of the conjectures and attempts by which it was
preceded, and the growing acquaintance with facts, which made the want
of such an explanation felt.</p>
<p>In the steps previously made in astronomical knowledge, no
ingenuity had been required to devise the view which was adopted. The
motions of the stars and sun were most naturally and almost
irresistibly conceived as the results of motion in a revolving sphere;
the indications of position which we obtain from different places on
the earth’s surface, when clearly combined, obviously imply a globular
shape. In these cases, the first conjectures, the supposition of the
simplest form, of the most uniform motion, required no
after-correction. But this manifest simplicity, this easy and obvious
explanation, did not apply to the movement of all the heavenly bodies.
The Planets, the “wandering stars,” could not be so easily understood;
the motion of each, as Cicero says, “undergoing very remarkable
changes in its course, going before and behind, quicker and slower,
appearing in the evening, but gradually lost there, and emerging again
in the morning.”<a id="fnanchor55-3" href="#note55-3"><span
class="fnanchor">55</span></a> A continued attention to these stars
would, however, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page139">139</a></span>
detect a kind of intricate regularity in their motions, which might
naturally be described as “a dance.” The Chaldeans are stated by
Diodorus<a id="fnanchor56-3" href="#note56-3"><span
class="fnanchor">56</span></a> to have observed assiduously the
risings and settings of the planets, from the top of the temple of
Belus. By doing this, they would find the times in which the forward
and backward movements of Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars recur; and also
the time in which they come round to the same part of the heavens.<a
id="fnanchor57-3" href="#note57-3"><span
class="fnanchor">57</span></a> Venus and Mercury never recede far from
the sun, and the intervals which elapse while either of them leaves
its greatest distance from the sun and returns again to the greatest
distance on the same side, would easily be observed.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note55-3"
href="#fnanchor55-3">55</a></span> Cic. <i>de Nat. D.</i> lib. ii. p.
450. “Ea quæ Saturni stella dicitur, φαίνωνque a Græcis nominatur, quæ
a terra abest plurimum, xxx fere annis cursum suum conficit; in quo
cursu multa mirabiliter efficiens, tum antecedendo, tum retardando,
tum vespertinis temporibus delitescendo, tum matutinis se rursum
aperiendo, nihil immutat sempiternis sæculorum ætatibus, quin eadem
iisdem temporibus efficiat.” And so of the other planets.</div>

204.</div>
<p id="spheres">Probably the manner in which the motions of the
planets were originally reduced to rule was something like the
following:&#8212;In about 30 of our years, Saturn goes 29 times
through his <i>Anomaly</i>, that is, the succession of varied motions
by which he sometimes goes forwards and sometimes backwards among the
stars. During this time, he goes once round the heavens, and returns
nearly to the same place. This is the cycle of his apparent
motions.</p>
<p>Perhaps the eastern nations contented themselves with thus
referring these motions to cycles of time, so as to determine their
recurrence. Something of this kind was done at an early period, as we
have seen.</p>
<p>But the Greeks soon attempted to frame to themselves a sensible
image of the mechanism by which these complex motions were produced;
nor did they find this difficult. Venus, for instance, who, upon the
whole, moves from west to east among the stars, is seen, at certain
intervals, to return or move <i>retrograde</i> a short way back from
east to west, then to become for a short time <i>stationary</i>, then
to turn again and resume her <i>direct</i> motion westward, and so on.
Now this can be explained by supposing that she is placed in the rim
of a wheel, which is turned edgeways to us, and of which the centre
turns round in the heavens from west to east, while the wheel,
carrying the planet in its motion, moves round its own centre. In this
way the motion of the wheel about its centre, would, in some
situations, counterbalance the general motion of the centre, and make
the planet retrograde, while, on the whole, the westerly motion would
prevail. Just as if we suppose that a person, holding a lamp in his
hand in the dark, and at a <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page140">140</a></span> distance, so that the lamp alone is
visible, should run on turning himself round; we should see the light
sometimes stationary, sometimes retrograde, but on the whole
progressive.</p>
<p>A mechanism of this kind was imagined for each of the planets, and
the wheels of which we have spoken were in the end called
<i>Epicycles</i>.</p>
<p>The application of such mechanism to the planets appears to have
arisen in Greece about the time of Aristotle. In the works of Plato we
find a strong taste for this kind of mechanical speculation. In the
tenth book of the “Polity,” we have the apologue of Alcinus the
Pamphylian, who, being supposed to be killed in battle, revived when
he was placed on the funeral pyre, and related what he had seen during
his trance. Among other revelations, he beheld the machinery by which
all the celestial bodies revolve. The axis of these revolutions is the
adamantine distaff which Destiny holds between her knees; on this are
fixed, by means of different sockets, flat rings, by which the planets
are carried. The order and magnitude of these spindles are minutely
detailed. Also, in the “Epilogue to the Laws” (<i>Epinomis</i>), he
again describes the various movements of the sky, so as to show a
distinct acquaintance with the general character of the planetary
motions; and, after speaking of the Egyptians and Syrians as the
original cultivators of such knowledge, he adds some very remarkable
exhortations to his countrymen to prosecute the subject. “Whatever we
Greeks,” he says, “receive from the barbarians, we improve and
perfect; there is good hope and promise, therefore, that Greeks will
carry this knowledge far beyond that which was introduced from
abroad.” To this task, however, he looks with a due appreciation of
the qualities and preparation which it requires. “An astronomer must
be,” he says, “the wisest of men; his mind must be duly disciplined in
youth; especially is mathematical study necessary; both an
acquaintance with the doctrine of number, and also with that other
branch of mathematics, which, closely connected as it is with the
science of the <em>heavens</em>, we very absurdly call
<i>geometry</i>, the measurement of the <em>earth</em>.”<a

990.</div>
<p>Those anticipations were very remarkably verified in the subsequent
career of the Greek Astronomy.</p>
<p>The theory, once suggested, probably made rapid progress.
Simplicius<a id="fnanchor59-3" href="#note59-3"><span
class="fnanchor">59</span></a> relates, that Eudoxus of Cnidus
introduced the hypothesis of revolving circles or spheres. Calippus of
Cyzicus, having visited <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page141">141</a></span> Polemarchus, an intimate friend of
Eudoxus, they went together to Athens, and communicated to Aristotle

it.</p>

<p>Probably at first this hypothesis was applied only to account for
the general phenomena of the progressions, retrogradations, and
stations of the planet; but it was soon found that the motions of the
sun and moon, and the circular motions of the planets, which the
hypothesis supposed, had other <i>anomalies</i> or irregularities,
which made a further extension of the hypothesis necessary.</p>
<p>The defect of uniformity in these motions of the sun and moon,
though less apparent than in the planets, is easily detected, as soon
as men endeavor to obtain any accuracy in their observations. We have
already stated (<a href="#v1page135">Chap. I.</a>) that the Chaldeans
were in possession of a period of about eighteen years, which they
used in the calculation of eclipses, and which might have been
discovered by close observation of the moon’s motions; although it was
probably rather hit upon by noting the recurrence of eclipses. The
moon moves in a manner which is not reducible to regularity without
considerable care and time. If we trace her path among the stars, we
find that, like the path of the sun, it is oblique to the equator, but
it does not, like that of the sun, pass over the same stars in
successive revolutions. Thus its <i>latitude</i>, or distance from the
equator, has a cycle different from its revolution among the stars;
and its <i>Nodes</i>, or the points where it cuts the equator, are
perpetually changing their position. In addition to this, the moon’s
motion in her own path is not uniform; in the course of each lunation,
she moves alternately slower and quicker, passing gradually through
the intermediate degrees of velocity; and goes through the cycle of
these changes in something less than a month; this is called a
revolution of <i>Anomaly</i>. When the moon has gone through a
complete number of revolutions of Anomaly, and has, in the same time,
returned to the same position with regard to the sun, and also with
regard to her Nodes, her motions with respect to the sun will
thenceforth be the same as at the first, and all the circumstances on
which lunar eclipses depend being the same, the eclipses will occur in
the same order. In 6585⅓ days there are 239 revolutions of anomaly,
241 revolutions with regard to one of the Nodes, and, as we have said,
223 lunations or revolutions with regard to the sun. Hence this Period
will bring about a succession of the same lunar eclipses.</p>
<p>If the Chaldeans observed the moon’s motion among the stars with
any considerable accuracy, so as to detect this period by that means,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page142">142</a></span> they could
hardly avoid discovering the anomaly or unequal motion of the moon;
for in every revolution, her daily progression in the heavens varies
from about twenty-two to twenty-six times her own diameter. But there
is not, in their knowledge of this Period, any evidence that they had
measured the amount of this variation; and Delambre<a
id="fnanchor60-3" href="#note60-3"><span
class="fnanchor">60</span></a> is probably right in attributing all
such observations to the Greeks.</p>

<p>The sun’s motion would also be seen to be irregular as soon as men
had any exact mode of determining the lengths of the four seasons, by
means of the passage of the sun through the equinoctial and solstitial
points. For spring, summer, autumn, and winter, which would each
consist of an equal number of days if the motions were uniform, are,
in fact, found to be unequal in length.</p>
<p>It was not very difficult to see that the mechanism of epicycles
might be applied so as to explain irregularities of this kind. A wheel
travelling round the earth, while it revolved upon its centre, might
produce the effect of making the sun or moon fixed in its rim go
sometimes faster and sometimes slower in appearance, just in the same
way as the same suppositions would account for a planet going
sometimes forwards and sometimes backwards: the epicycles of the sun
and moon would, for this purpose, be less than those of the planets.
Accordingly, it is probable that, at the time of Plato and Aristotle,
philosophers were already endeavoring to apply the hypothesis to these
cases, though it does not appear that any one fully succeeded before
Hipparchus.</p>
<p>The problem which was thus present to the minds of astronomers, and
which Plato is said to have proposed to them in a distinct form, was,
“To reconcile the celestial phenomena by the combination of equable
circular motions.” That the circular motions should be equable as well
as circular, was a condition, which, if it had been merely tried at
first, as the most simple and definite conjecture, would have deserved
praise. But this condition, which is, in reality, inconsistent with
nature, was, in the sequel, adhered to with a pertinacity which
introduced endless complexity into the system. The history of this
assumption is one of the most marked instances of that love of
simplicity and symmetry which is the source of all general truths,
though it so often produces and perpetuates error. At present we can
easily see how fancifully the notion of simplicity and perfection was
interpreted, in the arguments by which the opinion was defended, that
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page143">143</a></span> real
motions of the heavenly bodies must be circular and uniform. The
Pythagoreans, as well as the Platonists, maintained this dogma.
According to Geminus, “They supposed the motions of the sun, and the
moon, and the five planets, to be circular and equable: for they would
not allow of such disorder among divine and eternal things, as that
they should sometimes move quicker, and sometimes slower, and
sometimes stand still; for no one would tolerate such anomaly in the
movements, even of a man, who was decent and orderly. The occasions of
life, however, are often reasons for men going quicker or slower, but
in the incorruptible nature of the stars, it is not possible that any
cause can be alleged of quickness and slowness. Whereupon they
propounded this question, how the phenomena might be represented by
equable and circular motions.”</p>
<p>These conjectures and assumptions led naturally to the
establishment of the various parts of the Theory of Epicycles. It is
probable that this theory was adopted with respect to the Planets at
or before the time of Plato. And Aristotle gives us an account of the
system thus devised.<a id="fnanchor61-3" href="#note61-3"><span
class="fnanchor">61</span></a> “Eudoxus,” he says, “attributed four
spheres to each Planet: the first revolved with the fixed stars (and
this produced the diurnal motion); the second gave the planet a motion
along the ecliptic (the mean motion in longitude); the third had its
axis perpendicular<a id="fnanchor62-3" href="#note62-3"><span
class="fnanchor">62</span></a> to the ecliptic (and this gave the
inequality of each planetary motion, really arising from its special
motion about the sun); the fourth produced the oblique motion
transverse to this (the motion in latitude).” He is also said to have
attributed a motion in latitude and a corresponding sphere to the Sun
as well as to the Moon, of which it is difficult to understand the
meaning, if Aristotle has reported rightly of the theory; for it would
be absurd to ascribe to Eudoxus a knowledge of the motions by which
the sun deviates from the ecliptic. Calippus conceived that two
additional spheres must be given to the sun and to the moon, in order
to explain the phenomena: probably he was aware of the inequalities of
the motions of these luminaries. He also proposed an additional sphere
for each planet, to account, we may suppose, for the results of the
eccentricity of the orbits.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note61-3"

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note62-3"
href="#fnanchor62-3">62</a></span> Aristotle says “has its poles in
the ecliptic,” but this must be a mistake of his. He professes merely
to receive these opinions from the mathematical astronomers, “ἐκ τῆς
οἰκειοτάτης φιλοσοφίας τῶν μαθηματικῶν.”</div>
<p>The hypothesis, in this form, does not appear to have been reduced
to measure, and was, moreover, unnecessarily complex. The resolution
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page144">144</a></span> of the oblique
motion of the moon into two separate motions, by Eudoxus, was not the
simplest way of conceiving it; and Calippus imagined the connection of
these spheres in some way which made it necessary nearly to double
their number; in this manner his system had no less than 55
spheres.</p>
<p>Such was the progress which the <i>Idea</i> of the hypothesis of
epicycles had made in men’s minds, previously to the establishment of
the theory by Hipparchus. There had also been a preparation for this
step, on the other side, by the collection of <i>Facts</i>. We know
that observations of the Eclipses of the Moon were made by the
Chaldeans 367 <span class="sc">b. c.</span> at Babylon, and were known
to the Greeks; for Hipparchus and Ptolemy founded their Theory of the
Moon on these observations. Perhaps we cannot consider, as equally
certain, the story that, at the time of Alexander’s conquest, the
Chaldeans possessed a series of observations, which went back 1903
years, and which Aristotle caused Callisthenes to bring to him in
Greece. All the Greek observations which are of any value, begin with
the school of Alexandria. Aristyllus and Timocharis appear, by the
citations of Hipparchus, to have observed the Places of Stars and
Planets, and the Times of the Solstices, at various periods from <span
class="sc">b. c.</span> 295 to <span class="sc">b. c.</span> 269.
Without their observations, indeed, it would not have been easy for
Hipparchus to establish either the Theory of the Sun or the Precession
of the Equinoxes.</p>
<p>In order that observations at distant intervals may be compared
with each other, they must be referred to some common era. The
Chaldeans dated by the era of Nabonassar, which commenced 749 <span
class="sc">b. c.</span> The Greek observations were referred to the
Calippic periods of 76 years, of which the first began 331 <span

<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Establishment of the Theory
of Epicycles and Eccentrics.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">ALTHOUGH</span>, as we have already
seen, at the time of Plato, the Idea of Epicycles had been suggested,
and the problem of its general application proposed, and solutions of
this problem offered by his followers; we still consider Hipparchus as
the real discoverer and founder of that theory; inasmuch as he not
only guessed that it <em>might</em>, but showed that it <em>must</em>,
account for the phenomena, both as to their nature and as to their
quantity. The assertion that “he only discovers who proves,” is just;
not only because, until a theory is proved to be the true one, it has
no pre-eminence over the numerous other guesses among which it
circulates, and above which the proof alone elevates it; but also
because he who takes hold of the theory so as to apply calculation to
it, possesses it with a distinctness of conception which makes it
peculiarly his.</p>
<p>In order to establish the Theory of Epicycles, it was necessary to
assign the magnitudes, distances, and positions of the circles or
spheres in which the heavenly bodies were moved, in such a manner as
to account for their apparently irregular motions. We may best
understand what was the problem to be solved, by calling to mind what
we now know to be the real motions of the heavens. The true motion of
the earth round the sun, and therefore the apparent annual motion of
the sun, is performed, not in a circle of which the earth is the
centre, but in an ellipse or oval, the earth being nearer to one end
than to the other; and the motion is most rapid when the sun is at the
nearer end of this oval. But instead of an oval, we may suppose the
sun to move uniformly in a circle, the earth being now, not in the
centre, but nearer to one side; for on this supposition, the sun will
appear to move most quickly when he is nearest to the earth, or in his
<i>Perigee</i>, as that point is called. Such an orbit is called an
<i>Eccentric</i>, and the distance of the earth from the centre of the
circle is called the <i>Eccentricity</i>. It may easily be shown by
geometrical reasoning, that the inequality of apparent motion so
produced, is exactly the same in <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page146">146</a></span> detail, as the inequality which follows
from the hypothesis of a small <i>Epicycle</i>, turning uniformly on
its axis, and carrying the sun in its circumference, while the centre
of this epicycle moves uniformly in a circle of which the earth is the
centre. This identity of the results of the hypothesis of the
Eccentric and the Epicycle is proved by Ptolemy in the third book of
the “Almagest.”</p>
<p><i>The Sun’s Eccentric.</i>&#8212;When Hipparchus had clearly
conceived these hypotheses, as <em>possible</em> ways of accounting
for the sun’s motion, the task which he had to perform, in order to
show that they deserved to be adopted, was to assign a place to the
<i>Perigee</i>, a magnitude to the <i>Eccentricity</i>, and an
<i>Epoch</i> at which the sun was at the perigee; and to show that, in
this way, he had produced a true representation of the motions of the
sun. This, accordingly, he did; and having thus determined, with
considerable exactness, both the law of the solar irregularities, and
the numbers on which their amount depends, he was able to assign the
motions and places of the sun for any moment of future time with
corresponding exactness; he was able, in short, to construct <i>Solar
Tables</i>, by means of which the sun’s place with respect to the
stars could be correctly found at any time. These tables (as they are
given by Ptolemy)<a id="fnanchor63-3" href="#note63-3"><span
class="fnanchor">63</span></a> give the <i>Anomaly</i>, or inequality
of the sun’s motion; and this they exhibit by means of the
<i>Prosthapheresis</i>, the quantity of which, at any distance of the
sun from the <i>Apogee</i>, it is requisite to add to or subtract from
the arc, which he would have described if his motion had been
equable.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note63-3"
href="#fnanchor63-3">63</a></span> Syntax. 1. iii.</div>
<p>The reader might perhaps expect that the calculations which thus
exhibited the motions of the sun for an indefinite future period must
depend upon a considerable number of observations made at all seasons
of the year. That, however, was not the case; and the genius of the
discoverer appeared, as such genius usually does appear, in his
perceiving how small a number of facts, rightly considered, were
sufficient to form a foundation for the theory. The number of days
contained in two seasons of the year sufficed for this purpose to
Hipparchus. “Having ascertained,” says Ptolemy, “that the time from
the vernal equinox to the summer tropic is 94½ days, and the time from
the summer tropic to the autumnal equinox 92½ days, from these
phenomena alone he demonstrates that the straight line joining the
centre of the sun’s eccentric path with the centre of the zodiac (the
spectator’s eye) is nearly the 24th part of the radius of the
eccentric path; and that <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page147">147</a></span> its <i>apogee</i> precedes the summer
solstice by 24½ degrees nearly, the zodiac containing 360.”</p>
<p>The exactness of the Solar Tables, or <i>Canon</i>, which was
founded on these data, was manifested, not only by the coincidence of
the sun’s calculated place with such observations as the Greek
astronomers of this period were able to make (which were indeed very
rude), but by its enabling them to calculate solar and lunar eclipses;
phenomena which are a very precise and severe trial of the accuracy of
such tables, inasmuch as a very minute change in the apparent place of
the sun or moon would completely alter the obvious features of the
eclipse. Though the tables of this period were by no means perfect,
they bore with tolerable credit this trying and perpetually recurring
test; and thus proved the soundness of the theory on which the tables
were calculated.</p>
<p><i>The Moon’s Eccentric.</i>&#8212;The moon’s motions have many
irregularities; but when the hypothesis of an Eccentric or an Epicycle
had sufficed in the case of the sun, it was natural to try to explain,
in the same way, the motions of the moon; and it was shown by
Hipparchus that such hypotheses would account for the more obvious
anomalies. It is not very easy to describe the several ways in which
these hypotheses were applied, for it is, in truth, very difficult to
explain in words even the mere facts of the moon’s motion. If she were
to leave a visible bright line behind her in the heavens wherever she
moved, the path thus exhibited would be of an extremely complex
nature; the circle of each revolution slipping away from the
preceding, and the traces of successive revolutions forming a sort of
band of net-work running round the middle of the sky.<a
id="fnanchor64-3" href="#note64-3"><span
class="fnanchor">64</span></a> In each revolution, the motion in
longitude is affected by an anomaly of the same nature as the sun’s
anomaly already spoken of; but besides this, the path of the moon
deviates from the ecliptic to the north and to the south of the
ecliptic, and thus she has a motion in latitude. This motion in
latitude would be sufficiently known if we knew the period of its
<i>restoration</i>, that is, the time which the moon occupies in
moving from any latitude till she is restored to the same latitude;
as, for instance, from the ecliptic on one side of the heavens to the
ecliptic on the same side of the heavens again. But it is found that
the period of the restoration of the latitude is not the same as the
period of the restoration of the longitude, that is, as the period of
the moon’s revolution among the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page148">148</a></span> stars; and thus the moon describes a
different path among the stars in every successive revolution, and her
path, as well as her velocity, is constantly variable.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note64-3"
href="#fnanchor64-3">64</a></span> The reader will find an attempt to
make the nature of this path generally intelligible in the
<i>Companion to the British Almanac</i> for 1814.</div>
<p>Hipparchus, however, reduced the motions of the moon to rule and to
Tables, as he did those of the sun, and in the same manner. He
determined, with much greater accuracy than any preceding astronomer,
the mean or average equable motions of the moon in longitude and in
latitude; and he then represented the anomaly of the motion in
longitude by means of an eccentric, in the same manner as he had done
for the sun.</p>
<p>But here there occurred still an additional change, besides those
of which we have spoken. The Apogee of the Sun was always in the same
place in the heavens; or at least so nearly so, that Ptolemy could
detect no error in the place assigned to it by Hipparchus 250 years
before. But the Apogee of the Moon was found to have a motion among
the stars. It had been observed before the time of Hipparchus, that in
6585⅓ days, there are 241 revolutions of the moon with regard to the
stars, but only 239 revolutions with regard to the anomaly. This
difference could be suitably represented by supposing the eccentric,
in which the moon moves, to have itself an angular motion, perpetually
carrying its apogee in the same direction in which the moon travels;
but this supposition being made, it was necessary to determine, not
only the eccentricity of the orbit, and place of the apogee at a
certain time, but also the rate of motion of the apogee itself, in
order to form tables of the moon.</p>
<p>This task, as we have said, Hipparchus executed; and in this
instance, as in the problem of the reduction of the sun’s motion to
tables, the data which he found it necessary to employ were very few.
He deduced all his conclusions from six eclipses of the moon.<a
id="fnanchor65-3" href="#note65-3"><span
class="fnanchor">65</span></a> Three of these, the records of which
were brought from Babylon, where a register of such occurrences was
kept, happened in the 366th and 367th years from the era of
Nabonassar, and enabled Hipparchus to determine the eccentricity and
apogee of the moon’s orbit at that time. The three others were
observed at Alexandria, in the 547th year of Nabonassar, which gave
him another position of the orbit at an interval of 180 years; and he
thus became acquainted with the motion of the orbit itself, as well as
its form.<a id="fnanchor66-3" href="#note66-3"><span
class="fnanchor">66</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note66-3"
href="#fnanchor66-3">66</a></span> Ptolemy uses the hypothesis of an
epicycle for the moon’s first inequality; but Hipparchus employs an
eccentric.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page149">149</a></span> The moon’s
motions are really affected by several other inequalities, of very
considerable amount, besides those which were thus considered by
Hipparchus; but the lunar paths, constructed on the above data,
possessed a considerable degree of correctness, and especially when
applied, as they were principally, to the calculation of eclipses; for
the greatest of the additional irregularities which we have mentioned
disappear at new and full moon, which are the only times when eclipses
take place.</p>
<p>The numerical explanation of the motions of the sun and moon, by
means of the Hypothesis of Eccentrics, and the consequent construction
of tables, was one of the great achievements of Hipparchus. The
general explanation of the motions of the planets, by means of the
hypothesis of epicycles, was in circulation previously, as we have
seen. But the special motions of the planets, in their epicycles, are,
in reality, affected by anomalies of the same kind as those which
render it necessary to introduce eccentrics in the cases of the sun
and moon.</p>
<p>Hipparchus determined, with great exactness, the <i>Mean
Motions</i> of the Planets; but he was not able, from want of data, to
explain the planetary <i>Irregularities</i> by means of Eccentrics.
The whole mass of good observations of the planets which he received
from preceding ages, did not contain so many, says Ptolemy, as those
which he has transmitted to us of his own. “Hence<a id="fnanchor67-3"
href="#note67-3"><span class="fnanchor">67</span></a> it was,” he
adds, “that while he labored, in the most assiduous manner to
represent the motions of the sun and moon by means of equable circular
motions; with respect to the planets, so far as his works show, he did
not even make the attempt, but merely put the extant observations in
order, added to them himself more than the whole of what he received
from preceding ages, and showed the insufficiency of the hypothesis
current among astronomers to explain the phenomena.” It appears that
preceding mathematicians had already pretended to construct “a
Perpetual Canon,” that is, Tables which should give the places of the
planets at any future time; but these being constructed without regard
to the eccentricity of the orbits, must have been very erroneous.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note67-3"
href="#fnanchor67-3">67</a></span> <i>Synt.</i> ix. 2.</div>
<p>Ptolemy declares, with great reason, that Hipparchus showed his
usual love of truth, and his right sense of the responsibility of his
task, in leaving this part of it to future ages. The Theories of the
Sun and Moon, which we have already described, constitute him a great
astronomical discoverer, and justify the reputation he has always
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page150">150</a></span> possessed.
There is, indeed, no philosopher who is so uniformly spoken of in
terms of admiration. Ptolemy, to whom we owe our principal knowledge
of him, perpetually couples with his name epithets of praise: he is
not only an excellent and careful observer, but “a<a id="fnanchor68-3"
href="#note68-3"><span class="fnanchor">68</span></a> most
truth-loving and labor-loving person,” one who had shown extraordinary
sagacity and remarkable desire of truth in every part of science.
Pliny, after mentioning him and Thales, breaks out into one of his
passages of declamatory vehemence: “Great men! elevated above the
common standard of human nature, by discovering the laws which
celestial occurrences obey, and by freeing the wretched mind of man
from the fears which eclipses inspired&#8212;Hail to you and to your
genius, interpreters of heaven, worthy recipients of the laws of the
universe, authors of principles which connect gods and men!” Modern
writers have spoken of Hipparchus with the same admiration; and even
the exact but severe historian of astronomy, Delambre, who bestows his
praise so sparingly, and his sarcasm so generally;&#8212;who says<a
id="fnanchor69-3" href="#note69-3"><span

of Aristarchus that his work has come to us entire, and who cannot
refer<a id="fnanchor70-3" href="#note70-3"><span
class="fnanchor">70</span></a> to the statement of an eclipse rightly
predicted by Halicon of Cyzicus without adding, that if the story be
true, Halicon was more lucky than prudent;&#8212;loses all his
bitterness when he comes to Hipparchus.<a id="fnanchor71-3"

says he, “we find one of the most extraordinary men of antiquity; the
<em>very greatest</em>, in the sciences which require a combination of
observation with geometry.” Delambre adds, apparently in the wish to
reconcile this eulogium with the depreciating manner in which he
habitually speaks of all astronomers whose observations are inexact,
“a long period and the continued efforts of many industrious men are
requisite to produce good instruments, but energy and assiduity depend
on the man himself.”</p>

<p>Hipparchus was the author of other great discoveries and
improvements in astronomy, besides the establishment of the Doctrine
of Eccentrics and Epicycles; but this, being the greatest advance in
the <em>theory</em> of the celestial motions which was made by the
ancients, must be the leading subject of our attention in the present

<p><span class="sc">It</span> may be useful here to explain the value
of the theoretical step which Hipparchus thus made; and the more so,
as there are, perhaps, opinions in popular circulation, which might
lead men to think lightly of the merit of introducing or establishing
the Doctrine of Epicycles. For, in the first place, this doctrine is
now acknowledged to be false; and some of the greatest men in the more
modern history of astronomy owe the brightest part of their fame to
their having been instrumental in overturning this hypothesis. And,
moreover, in the next place, the theory is not only false, but
extremely perplexed and entangled, so that it is usually looked upon

extravagant conception of the nature of the orbs which it introduces;
that they are crystalline spheres, and that the vast spaces which
intervene between the celestial luminaries are a solid mass, formed by
the fitting together of many masses perpetually in motion; an
imagination which is presumed to be incredible and monstrous.</p>

<p>We must endeavor to correct or remove these prejudices, not only in
order that we may do justice to the Hipparchian, or, as it is usually
called, Ptolemaic system of astronomy, and to its founder; but for
another reason, much more important to the purpose of this work; <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page152">152</a></span> namely, that we may
see how theories may be highly estimable, though they contain false
representations of the real state of things, and may be extremely
useful, though they involve unnecessary complexity. In the advance of
knowledge, the value of the true part of a theory may much outweigh
the accompanying error, and the use of a rule may be little impaired
by its want of simplicity. The first steps of our progress do not lose
their importance because they are not the last; and the outset of the
journey may require no less vigor and activity than its close.</p>
<p>That which is true in the Hipparchian theory, and which no
succeeding discoveries have deprived of its value, is the
<em>Resolution</em> of the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies
into an assemblage of circular motions. The test of the truth and
reality of this Resolution is, that it leads to the construction of
theoretical Tables of the motions of the luminaries, by which their
places are given at any time, agreeing nearly with their places as
actually observed. The assumption that these circular motions, thus
introduced, are all exactly uniform, is the fundamental principle of
the whole process. This assumption is, it may be said, false; and we
have seen how fantastic some of the arguments were, which were
originally urged in its favor. But <em>some</em> assumption is
necessary, in order that the motions, at different points of a
revolution, may be somehow connected, that is, in order that we may
have any theory of the motions; and no assumption more simple than the
one now mentioned can be selected. The merit of the theory is
this;&#8212;that obtaining the amount of the eccentricity, the place
of the apogee, and, it may be, other elements, from <em>few</em>
observations, it deduces from these, results agreeing with
<em>all</em> observations, however numerous and distant. To express an
inequality by means of an epicycle, implies, not only that there is an
inequality, but further,&#8212;that the inequality is at its greatest
value at a certain known place,&#8212;diminishes in proceeding from
that place by a known law,&#8212;continues its diminution for a known
portion of the revolution of the luminary,&#8212;then increases again;
and so on: that is, the introduction of the epicycle represents the
inequality of motion, as completely as it can be represented with
respect to its <em>quantity</em>.</p>
<p>We may further illustrate this, by remarking that such a Resolution
of the unequal motions of the heavenly bodies into equable circular
motions, is, in fact, equivalent to the most recent and improved
processes by which modern astronomers deal with such motions. Their
universal method is to resolve all unequal motions into a series of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page153">153</a></span> <i>terms</i>,
or expressions of partial motions; and these terms involve
<i>sines</i> and <i>cosines</i>, that is, certain technical modes of
measuring circular motion, the circular motion having some constant
relation to the time. And thus the problem of the resolution of the
celestial motions into equable circular ones, which was propounded
above two thousand years ago in the school of Plato, is still the
great object of the study of modern astronomers, whether observers or
calculators.</p>
<p>That Hipparchus should have succeeded in the first great steps of
this resolution for the sun and moon, and should have seen its
applicability in other cases, is a circumstance which gives him one of
the most distinguished places in the roll of great astronomers. As to
the charges or the sneers against the complexity of his system, to
which we have referred, it is easy to see that they are of no force.
As a system of <em>calculation</em>, his is not only good, but, as we
have just said, in many cases no better has yet been discovered. If,
when the actual motions of the heavens are calculated in the best
possible way, the process is complex and difficult, and if we are
discontented at this, nature, and not the astronomer, must be the
object of our displeasure. This plea of the astronomers must be
allowed to be reasonable. “We must not be repelled,” says Ptolemy,<a
id="fnanchor74-3" href="#note74-3"><span
class="fnanchor">74</span></a> “by the complexity of the hypotheses,
but explain the phenomena as well as we can. If the hypotheses satisfy
each apparent inequality separately, the combination of them will
represent the truth; and why should it appear wonderful to any that
such a complexity should exist in the heavens, when we know nothing of
their nature which entitles us to suppose that any inconsistency will
result?”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note74-3"
href="#fnanchor74-3">74</a></span> <i>Synt.</i> xiii. 2.</div>
<p>But it may be said, we now know that the motions are more simple
than they were thus represented, and that the Theory of Epicycles was
false, as a conception of the real construction of the heavens. And to
this we may reply, that it does not appear that the best astronomers
of antiquity conceived the cycles and epicycles to have a material
existence. Though the dogmatic philosophers, as the Aristotelians,
appear to have taught that the celestial spheres were real solid
bodies, they are spoken of by Ptolemy as imaginary;<a
id="fnanchor75-3" href="#note75-3"><span
class="fnanchor">75</span></a> and it is clear, from his proof of the
identity of the results of the hypothesis of an eccentric and an
epicycle, that they are intended to pass for no more than geometrical
conceptions, in which view they are true representations of the
apparent motions.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note75-3"
href="#fnanchor75-3">75</a></span> Ibid. iii. 3.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page154">154</a></span> It is true,
that the real motions of the heavenly bodies are simpler than the
apparent motions; and that we, who are in the habit of representing to
our minds their real arrangement, become impatient of the seeming
confusion and disorder of the ancient hypotheses. But this real
arrangement never could have been detected by philosophers, if the
apparent motions had not been strictly examined and successfully
analyzed. How far the connection between the facts and the true theory
is from being obvious or easily traced, any one may satisfy himself by
endeavoring, from a general conception of the moon’s real motions, to
discover the rules which regulate the occurrences of eclipses; or even
to explain to a learner, of what nature the apparent motions of the
moon among the stars will be.</p>
<p>The unquestionable evidence of the merit and value of the Theory of
Epicycles is to be found in this circumstance;&#8212;that it served to
embody all the most exact knowledge then extant, to direct astronomers
to the proper methods of making it more exact and complete, to point
out new objects of attention and research; and that, after doing this
at first, it was also able to take in, and preserve, all the new
results of the active and persevering labors of a long series of
Greek, Latin, Arabian, and modern European astronomers, till a new
theory arose which could discharge this office. It may, perhaps,
surprise some readers to be told, that the author of this next
<em>great</em> step in astronomical theory, Copernicus, adopted the
theory of epicycles; that is, he employed that which we have spoken of
as its really valuable characteristic. “We<a id="fnanchor76-3"
href="#note76-3"><span class="fnanchor">76</span></a> must confess,”
he says, “that the celestial motions are circular, or compounded of
several circles, since their inequalities observe a fixed law and
recur in value at certain intervals, which could not be, except that
they were circular; for a circle alone can make that which has been,
recur again.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note76-3"
href="#fnanchor76-3">76</a></span> Copernicus. <i>De Rev.</i> 1. i. c.
4.</div>
<p>In this sense, therefore, the Hipparchian theory was a real and
indestructible truth, which was not rejected, and replaced by
different truths, but was adopted and incorporated into every
succeeding astronomical theory; and which can never cease to be one of
the most important and fundamental parts of our astronomical
knowledge.</p>
<p>A moment’s reflection will show that, in the events just spoken of,
the introduction and establishment of the Theory of Epicycles, those
characteristics were strictly exemplified, which we have asserted to
be the conditions of every real advance in progressive science;
namely, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page155">155</a></span> the
application of distinct and appropriate Ideas to a real series of
Facts. The distinctness of the geometrical conceptions which enabled
Hipparchus to assign the Orbits of the Sun and Moon, requires no
illustration; and we have just explained how these ideas combined into
a connected whole the various motions and places of those luminaries.
To make this step in astronomy, required diligence and care, exerted
in collecting observations, and mathematical clearness and steadiness
of view, exercised in seeing and showing that the theory was a
successful analysis of them.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Discovery of the Precession of the
Equinoxes.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> same qualities which we trace in the
researches of Hipparchus already examined,&#8212;diligence in
collecting observations, and clearness of idea in representing
them,&#8212;appear also in other discoveries of his, which we must not
pass unnoticed. The Precession of the Equinoxes, in particular, is one
of the most important of these discoveries.</p>
<p>The circumstance here brought into notice was a Change of Longitude
of the Fixed Stars. The longitudes of the heavenly bodies, being
measured from the point where the sun’s annual path cuts the equator,
will change if that path changes. Whether this happens, however, is
not very easy to decide; for the sun’s path among the stars is made
out, not by merely looking at the heavens, but by a series of
inferences from other observable facts. Hipparchus used for this
purpose eclipses of the moon; for these, being exactly opposite to the
sun, afford data in marking out his path. By comparing the eclipses of
his own time with those observed at an earlier period by Timocharis,
he found that the bright star, Spica Virginis, was six degrees behind
the equinoctial point in his own time, and had been eight degrees
behind the same point at an earlier epoch. The suspicion was thus
suggested, that the longitudes of all the stars increase perpetually;
but Hipparchus had too truly philosophical a spirit to take this for
granted. He examined the places of Regulus, and those of other stars,
as he had done those of Spica; and he found, in all these instances, a
change of place which could be explained by a certain alteration of
position in the circles to which the stars are referred, which
alteration is described as the Precession of the Equinoxes.</p>
<p>The distinctness with which Hipparchus conceived this change of
relation of the heavens, is manifested by the question which, as we
are told by Ptolemy, he examined and decided;&#8212;that this motion
of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page156">156</a></span> heavens
takes place about the poles of the ecliptic, and not about those of
the equator. The care with which he collected this motion from the
stars themselves, may be judged of from this, that having made his
first observations for this purpose on Spica and Regulus, zodiacal
stars, his first suspicion was that the stars of the zodiac alone
changed their longitude, which suspicion he disproved by the
examination of other stars. By his processes, the idea of the nature
of the motion, and the evidence of its existence, the two conditions
of a discovery, were fully brought into view. The scale of the facts
which Hipparchus was thus able to reduce to law, may be in some
measure judged of by recollecting that the precession, from his time
to ours, has only carried the stars through one sign of the zodiac;
and that, to complete one revolution of the sky by the motion thus
discovered, would require a period of 25,000 years. Thus this
discovery connected the various aspects of the heavens at the most
remote periods of human history; and, accordingly, the novel and
ingenious views which Newton published in his chronology, are founded
on this single astronomical fact, the Precession of the Equinoxes.</p>
<p>The two discoveries which have been described, the mode of
constructing Solar and Lunar Tables, and the Precession, were advances
of the greatest importance in astronomy, not only in themselves, but
in the new objects and undertakings which they suggested to
astronomers. The one discovery detected a constant law and order in
the midst of perpetual change and apparent disorder; the other
disclosed mutation and movement perpetually operating where every
thing had been supposed fixed and stationary. Such discoveries were
well adapted to call up many questionings in the minds of speculative
men; for, after this, nothing could be supposed constant till it had
been ascertained to be so by close examination; and no apparent
complexity or confusion could justify the philosopher in turning away
in despair from the task of simplification. To answer the inquiries
thus suggested, new methods of observing the facts were requisite,
more exact and uniform than those hitherto employed. Moreover, the
discoveries which were made, and others which could not fail to follow
in their train, led to many consequences, required to be reasoned
upon, systematized, completed, enlarged. In short, the <i>Epoch of
Induction</i> led, as we have stated that such epochs must always
lead, to a <i>Period of Development</i>, <i>of Verification</i>,
<i>Application</i>, <i>and Extension</i>. <span class="pagenum"><a

<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Researches which verified
the Theory.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> discovery of the leading
Laws of the Solar and Lunar Motions, and the detection of the
Precession, may be considered as the great positive steps in the
Hipparchian astronomy;&#8212;the parent discoveries, from which many
minor improvements proceeded. The task of pursuing the collateral and
consequent researches which now offered themselves,&#8212;of bringing
the other parts of astronomy up to the level of its most improved
portions,&#8212;was prosecuted by a succession of zealous observers
and calculators, first, in the school of Alexandria, and afterwards in
other parts of the world. We must notice the various labors of this
series of astronomers; but we shall do so very briefly; for the
ulterior development of doctrines once established is not so important
an object of contemplation for our present purpose, as the first
conception and proof of those fundamental truths on which systematic
doctrines are founded. Yet Periods of Verification, as well as Epochs
of Induction, deserve to be attended to; and they can nowhere be
studied with so much advantage as in the history of astronomy.</p>
<p>In truth, however, Hipparchus did not leave to his successors the
task of pursuing into detail those views of the heavens to which his
discoveries led him. He examined with scrupulous care almost every
part of the subject. We must briefly mention some of the principal
points which were thus settled by him.</p>
<p>The verification of the laws of the changes which he assigned to
the skies, implied that the condition of the heavens was constant,
except so far as it was affected by those changes. Thus, the doctrine
that the changes of position of the stars were rightly represented by
the precession of the equinoxes, supposed that the stars were fixed
with regard to each other; and the doctrine that the unequal number of
days, in certain subdivisions of months and years, was adequately
explained by the theory of epicycles, assumed that years and days were
always of constant lengths. But Hipparchus was not content with
assuming these bases of his theory, he endeavored to prove them. <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page158">158</a></span></p>
<p>1. <i>Fixity of the Stars.</i>&#8212;The question necessarily arose
after the discovery of the precession, even if such a question had
never suggested itself before, whether the stars which were called
<i>fixed</i>, and to which the motions of the other luminaries are
referred, do really retain constantly the same relative position. In
order to determine this fundamental question, Hipparchus undertook to
construct a <i>Map</i> of the heavens; for though the result of his
survey was expressed in words, we may give this name to his Catalogue
of the positions of the most conspicuous stars. These positions are
described by means of <i>alineations</i>; that is, three or more such
stars are selected as can be touched by an apparent straight line
drawn in the heavens. Thus Hipparchus observed that the southern claw
of Cancer, the bright star in the same constellation which precedes
the head of the Hydra, and the bright star Procyon, were nearly in the
same line. Ptolemy quotes this and many other of the configurations
which Hipparchus had noted, in order to show that the positions of the
stars had not changed in the intermediate time; a truth which the
catalogue of Hipparchus thus gave astronomers the means of
ascertaining. It contained 1080 stars.</p>
<p>The construction of this catalogue of the stars by Hipparchus is an
event of great celebrity in the history of astronomy. Pliny,<a
id="fnanchor77-3" href="#note77-3"><span
class="fnanchor">77</span></a> who speaks of it with admiration as a
wonderful and superhuman task (“ausus rem etiam Deo improbam,
annumerare posteris stellas”), asserts the undertaking to have been
suggested by a remarkable astronomical event, the appearance of a new
star; “novam stellam et alium in ævo suo genitam deprehendit; ejusque
motu, qua die fulsit, ad dubitationem est adductus anne hoc sæpius
fieret, moverenturque et eæ quas putamus affixas.” There is nothing
inherently improbable in this tradition, but we may observe, with
Delambre,<a id="fnanchor78-3" href="#note78-3"><span
class="fnanchor">78</span></a> that we are not informed whether this
new star remained in the sky, or soon disappeared again. Ptolemy makes
no mention of the star or the story; and his catalogue contains no
<em>bright</em> star which is not found in the “Catasterisms” of
Eratosthenes. These Catasterisms were an enumeration of 475 of the
principal stars, according to the constellations in which they are,
and were published about sixty years before Hipparchus.</p>

href="#fnanchor78-3">78</a></span> <i>A. A.</i> i. 290.</div>
<p>2. <i>Constant Length of Years.</i>&#8212;Hipparchus also attempted
to ascertain whether successive years are all of the same length; and
though, with his scrupulous love of accuracy,<a id="fnanchor79-3"
href="#note79-3"><span class="fnanchor">79</span></a> he does not
appear to have <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page159">159</a></span>
thought himself justified in asserting that the years were always
exactly equal, he showed, both by observations of the time when the
sun passed the equinoxes, and by eclipses, that the difference of
successive years, if there were any difference, must be extremely
slight. The observations of succeeding astronomers, and especially of
Ptolemy, confirmed this opinion, and proved, with certainty, that
there is no progressive increase or diminution in the duration of the
year.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note79-3"
href="#fnanchor79-3">79</a></span> Ptolem. <i>Synt.</i> iii. 2.</div>
<p>3. <i>Constant Length of Days. Equation of Time.</i>&#8212;The
equality of days was more difficult to ascertain than that of years;
for the year is measured, as on a natural scale, by the number of days
which it contains; but the day can be subdivided into hours only by
artificial means; and the mechanical skill of the ancients did not
enable them to attain any considerable accuracy in the measure of such
portions of time; though clepsydras and similar instruments were used
by astronomers. The equality of days could only be proved, therefore,
by the consequences of such a supposition; and in this manner it
appears to have been assumed, as the fact really is, that the apparent
revolution of the stars is accurately uniform, never becoming either
quicker or slower. It followed, as a consequence of this, that the
solar days (or rather the <i>nycthemers</i>, compounded of a night and
a day) would be unequal, in consequence of the sun’s unequal motion,
thus giving rise to what we now call the <i>Equation of
Time</i>,&#8212;the interval by which the time, as marked on a dial,
is before or after the time, as indicated by the accurate timepieces
which modern skill can produce. This inequality was fully taken
account of by the ancient astronomers; and they thus in fact assumed
the equality of the sidereal days.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Researches which did not verify the
Theory.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">Some</span> of the researches of Hipparchus and
his followers fell upon the weak parts of his theory; and if the
observations had been sufficiently exact, must have led to its being
corrected or rejected.</p>
<p>Among these we may notice the researches which were made concerning
the <i>Parallax</i> of the heavenly bodies, that is, their apparent
displacement by the alteration of position of the observer from one
part of the earth’s surface to the other. This subject is treated of
at length by Ptolemy; and there can be no doubt that it was well
examined by Hipparchus, who invented a <i>parallactic instrument</i>
for that purpose. The idea of parallax, as a geometrical possibility,
was indeed too obvious to be overlooked by geometers at any time; and
when the doctrine of the sphere was established, it must have appeared
strange <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page160">160</a></span> to the
student, that every place on the earth’s surface might alike be
considered as the centre of the celestial motions. But if this was
true with respect to the motions of the fixed stars, was it also true
with regard to those of the sun and moon? The displacement of the sun
by parallax is so small, that the best observers among the ancients
could never be sure of its existence; but with respect to the moon,
the case is different. She may be displaced by this cause to the
amount of twice her own breadth, a quantity easily noticed by the
rudest process of instrumental observation. The law of the
displacement thus produced is easily obtained by theory, the globular
form of the earth being supposed known; but the amount of the
displacement depends upon the distance of the moon from the earth, and
requires at least one good observation to determine it. Ptolemy has
given a table of the effects of parallax, calculated according to the
apparent altitude of the moon, assuming certain supposed distances;
these distances, however, do not follow the real law of the moon’s
distances, in consequence of their being founded upon the Hypothesis
of the Eccentric and Epicycle.</p>
<p>In fact this Hypothesis, though a very close representation of the
truth, so far as the <em>positions</em> of the luminaries are
concerned, fails altogether when we apply it to their
<em>distances</em>. The radius of the epicycle, or the eccentricity of
the eccentric, are determined so as to satisfy the observations of the
apparent <em>motions</em> of the bodies; but, inasmuch as the
hypothetical motions are different altogether from the real motions,
the Hypothesis does not, at the same time, satisfy the observations of
the <em>distances</em> of the bodies, if we are able to make any such
observations.</p>
<p>Parallax is one method by which the distances of the moon, at
different times, may be compared; her Apparent Diameters afford
another method. Neither of these modes, however, is easily capable of
such accuracy as to overturn at once the Hypothesis of epicycles; and,
accordingly, the Hypothesis continued to be entertained in spite of
such measures; the measures being, indeed, in some degree falsified in
consequence of the reigning opinion. In fact, however, the
imperfection of the methods of measuring parallax and magnitude, which
were in use at this period, was such, their results could not lead to
any degree of conviction deserving to be set in opposition to a theory
which was so satisfactory with regard to the more certain
observations, namely, those of the motions.</p>
<p>The Eccentricity, or the Radius of the Epicycle, which would
satisfy <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page161">161</a></span> the
inequality of the <em>motions</em> of the moon, would, in fact, double
the inequality of the <em>distances</em>. The Eccentricity of the
moon’s orbit is determined by Ptolemy as <span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub></span> of the radius of the
orbit; but its real amount is only half as great; this difference is a
necessary consequence of the supposition of uniform circular motions,
on which the Epicyclic Hypothesis proceeds.</p>
<p>We see, therefore, that this part of the Hipparchian theory carries
in itself the germ of its own destruction. As soon as the art of
celestial measurement was so far perfected, that astronomers could be
sure of the apparent diameter of the moon within <span
style="font-size: 80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>30</sub></span> or
<span style="font-size: 80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>40</sub></span>
of the whole, the inconsistency of the theory with itself would become
manifest. We shall see, <a href="#fnanchor113-3">hereafter</a>, the way in which this inconsistency
operated; in reality a very long period elapsed before the methods of
observing were sufficiently good to bring it clearly into view.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.<i>&#8212;Methods of Observation of the Greek
Astronomers.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">We</span> must now say a word concerning the
Methods above spoken of. Since one of the most important tasks of
verification is to ascertain with accuracy the magnitude of the
quantities which enter, as elements, into the theory which occupies
men during the period; the improvement of instruments, and the methods
of observing and experimenting, are principal features in such
periods. We shall, therefore, mention some of the facts which bear
upon this point.</p>
<p>The estimation of distances among the stars by the eye, is an
extremely inexact process. In some of the ancient observations,
however, this appears to have been the method employed; and stars are
described as being <i>a cubit</i> or <i>two cubits</i> from other
stars. We may form some notion of the scale of this kind of
measurement, from what Cleomedes remarks,<a id="fnanchor80-3"
href="#note80-3"><span class="fnanchor">80</span></a> that the sun
appears to be about a foot broad; an opinion which he confutes at
length.</p>

<p>A method of determining the positions of the stars, susceptible of
a little more exactness than the former, is the use of
<i>alineations</i>, <a href="#v1page158">already</a> noticed in
speaking of Hipparchus’s catalogue. Thus, a straight line passing
through two stars of the Great Bear passes also through the pole-star;
this is, indeed, even now a method usually employed to enable us
readily to fix on the pole-star; and the two stars β and α of Ursa
Major, are hence often called “the pointers.” <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page162">162</a></span></p>
<p>But nothing like accurate measurements of any portions of the sky
were obtained, till astronomers adopted the method of making visual
coincidences of the objects with the instruments, either by means of
<i>shadows</i> or of <i>sights</i>.</p>
<p>Probably the oldest and most obvious measurements of the positions
of the heavenly bodies were those in which the elevation of the sun
was determined by comparing the length of the shadow of an upright
staff or <i>gnomon</i>, with the length of the staff itself. It
appears,<a id="fnanchor81-3" href="#note81-3"><span
class="fnanchor">81</span></a> from a memoir of Gautil, first printed
in the <i>Connaissance des Temps</i> for 1809, that, at the lower town
of Loyang, now called Hon-anfou, Tchon-kong found the length of the
shadow of the gnomon, at the summer solstice, equal to one foot and a
half, the gnomon itself being eight feet in length. This was about
1100 <span class="sc">b. c.</span> The Greeks, at an early period,
used the same method. Strabo says<a id="fnanchor82-3"
href="#note82-3"><span class="fnanchor">82</span></a> that “Byzantium
and Marseilles are on the same parallel of latitude, because the
shadows at those places have the same proportion to the gnomon,
according to the statement of Hipparchus, who follows Pytheas.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note81-3"

href="#fnanchor82-3">82</a></span> Del. <i>A. A.</i> i. 257.</div>
<p>But the relations of position which astronomy considers, are, for
the most part, angular distances; and these are most simply expressed
by the intercepted portion of a circumference described about the
angular point. The use of the gnomon might lead to the determination
of the angle by the graphical methods of geometry; but the numerical
expression of the circumference required some progress in
trigonometry; for instance, a table of the tangents of angles.</p>
<p>Instruments were soon invented for measuring angles, by means of
circles, which had a border or <i>limb</i>, divided into equal parts.
The whole circumference was divided into 360 <i>degrees</i>: perhaps
because the circles, first so divided, were those which represented
the sun’s annual path; one such degree would be the sun’s daily
advance, more nearly than any other convenient aliquot part which
could be taken. The position of the sun was determined by means of the
shadow of one part of the instrument upon the other. The most ancient
instrument of this kind appears to be the <i>Hemisphere of
Berosus</i>. A hollow hemisphere was placed with its rim horizontal,
and a style was erected in such a manner that the extremity of the
style was exactly at the centre of the sphere. The shadow of this
extremity, on the concave surface, had the same position with regard
to the lowest point of the sphere which the sun had with regard to the
highest point of the heavens. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page163">163</a></span> But this instrument was in fact used
rather for dividing the day into portions of time than for determining
position.</p>
<p>Eratosthenes<a id="fnanchor83-3" href="#note83-3"><span
class="fnanchor">83</span></a> observed the amount of the obliquity of
the sun’s path to the equator: we are not informed what instruments he
used for this purpose; but he is said to have obtained, from the
munificence of Ptolemy Euergetes, two <i>Armils</i>, or instruments
composed of circles, which were placed in the portico at Alexandria,
and long used for observations. If a circular rim or hoop were placed
so as to coincide with the plane of the equator, the inner concave
edge would be enlightened by the sun’s rays which came under the front
edge, when the sun was south of the equator, and by the rays which
came over the front edge, when the sun was north of the equator: the
moment of the transition would be the time of the equinox. Such an
instrument appears to be referred to by Hipparchus, as quoted by
Ptolemy.<a id="fnanchor84-3" href="#note84-3"><span
class="fnanchor">84</span></a> “The circle of copper, which stands at
Alexandria in what is called the Square Porch, appears to mark, as the
day of the equinox, that on which the concave surface begins to be
enlightened from the other side.” Such an instrument was called an
<i>equinoctial armil</i>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note83-3"
href="#fnanchor83-3">83</a></span> Delambre, <i>A. A.</i> i. 86.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note84-3"
href="#fnanchor84-3">84</a></span> Ptol. <i>Synt.</i> iii. 2.</div>
<p>A <i>solstitial armil</i> is described by Ptolemy, consisting of
two circular rims, one sliding round within the other, and the inner
one furnished with two pegs standing out from its surface at right
angles, and diametrically opposite to each other. These circles being
fixed in the plane of the meridian, and the inner one turned, till, at
noon, the shadow of the peg in front falls upon the peg behind, the
position of the sun at noon would be determined by the degrees on the
outer circle.</p>
<p>In calculation, the degree was conceived to be divided into 60
<i>minutes</i>, the minute into 60 <i>seconds</i>, and so on. But in
practice it was impossible to divide the limb of the instrument into
parts so small. The armils of Alexandria were divided into no parts
smaller than sixths of degrees, or divisions of 10 minutes.</p>
<p>The angles, observed by means of these divisions, were expressed as
a fraction of the circumference. Thus Eratosthenes stated the interval
between the tropics to be  <span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>11</sup>⁄<sub>83</sub></span> of the circumference.<a
id="fnanchor85-3" href="#note85-3"><span
class="fnanchor">85</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note85-3"
href="#fnanchor85-3">85</a></span> Delambre, <i>A. A.</i> i. 87. It is
probable that his observation gave him 47⅔ degrees. The fraction <span
style="font-size: 100%"><sup>47⅔</sup>⁄<sub>360</sub></span> =
<span style="font-size:
100%"><sup>143</sup>⁄<sub>1080</sub></span> = <span
style="white-space: nowrap;"><span style="font-size:

which is very nearly  <span style="font-size:
100%"><sup>11</sup>⁄<sub>83</sub></span>.</div>
<p>It was soon remarked that the whole circumference of the circle
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page164">164</a></span> was not wanted
for such observations. Ptolemy<a id="fnanchor86-3"
href="#note86-3"><span class="fnanchor">86</span></a> says that he
found it more convenient to observe altitudes by means of a square
flat piece of stone or wood, with a <i>quadrant</i> of a circle
described on one of its flat faces, about a centre near one of the
angles. A peg was placed at the centre, and one of the extreme radii
of the quadrant being perpendicular to the horizon, the elevation of
the sun above the horizon was determined by observing the point of the
arc of the quadrant on which the shadow of the peg fell.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note86-3"
href="#fnanchor86-3">86</a></span> <i>Synt.</i> i. 1.</div>
<p>As the necessity of accuracy in the observations was more and more
felt, various adjustments of such instruments were practised. The
instruments were placed in the meridian by means of a <i>meridian
line</i> drawn by astronomical methods on the floor on which they
stood. The plane of the instrument was made vertical by means of a
plumb-line: the bounding radius, from which angles were measured, was
also adjusted by the <i>plumb-line</i>.<a id="fnanchor87-3"
href="#note87-3"><span class="fnanchor">87</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note87-3"
href="#fnanchor87-3">87</a></span> The curvature of the plane of the
circle, by warping, was noticed. Ptol. iii. 2. p. 155, observes that
his equatorial circle was illuminated on the hollow side twice in the
same day. (He did not know that this might arise from
refraction.)</div>
<p>In this manner, the places of the sun and of the moon could be
observed by means of the shadows which they cast. In order to observe
the stars,<a id="fnanchor88-3" href="#note88-3"><span
class="fnanchor">88</span></a> the observer looked along the face of
the circle of the armil, so as to see its two edges apparently brought
together, and the star apparently touching them.<a id="fnanchor89-3"
href="#note89-3"><span class="fnanchor">89</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note88-3"

<p>It was afterwards found important to ascertain the position of the
sun with regard to the ecliptic: and, for this purpose, an instrument,
called an <i>astrolabe</i>, was invented, of which we have a
description in Ptolemy.<a id="fnanchor90-3" href="#note90-3"><span
class="fnanchor">90</span></a> This also consisted of circular rims,
movable within one another, or about poles; and contained circles
which were to be brought into the position of the ecliptic, and of a
plane passing through the sun and the poles of the ecliptic. The
position of the moon with regard to the ecliptic, and its position in
longitude with regard to the sun or a star, were thus determined.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note90-3"
href="#fnanchor90-3">90</a></span> <i>Synt.</i> v. 1.</div>
<p>The astrolabe continued long in use, but not so long as the
quadrant described by Ptolemy; this, in a larger form, is the <i>mural
quadrant</i>, which has been used up to the most recent times.</p>
<p>It may be considered surprising,<a id="fnanchor91-3"
href="#note91-3"><span class="fnanchor">91</span></a> that Hipparchus,
after having <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page165">165</a></span>
observed, for some time, right ascensions and declinations, quitted
equatorial armils for the astrolabe, which immediately refers the
stars to the ecliptic. He probably did this because, after the
discovery of precession, he found the latitudes of the stars constant,
and wanted to ascertain their motion in longitude.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note91-3"
href="#fnanchor91-3">91</a></span> Del. <i>A. A.</i> 181.</div>
<p>To the above instruments, may be added the <i>dioptra</i>, and the
<i>parallactic instrument</i> of Hipparchus and Ptolemy. In the
latter, the distance of a star from the zenith was observed by looking
through two sights fixed in a rule, this being annexed to another
rule, which was kept in a vertical position by a plumb-line; and the
angle between the two rules was measured.</p>
<p>The following example of an observation, taken from Ptolemy, may
serve to show the form in which the results of the instruments, just
described, were usually stated.<a id="fnanchor92-3"
href="#note92-3"><span class="fnanchor">92</span></a></p>

<p>“In the 2d year of Antoninus, the 9th day of Pharmouthi, the sun
being near setting, the last division of Taurus being on the meridian
(that is, 5½ equinoctial hours after noon), the moon was in 3 degrees
of Pisces, by her distance from the sun (which was 92 degrees, 8
minutes); and half an hour after, the sun being set, and the quarter
of Gemini on the meridian, Regulus appeared, by the other circle of
the astrolabe, 57½ degrees more forwards than the moon in longitude.”
From these data the longitude of Regulus is calculated.</p>
<p>From what has been said respecting the observations of the
Alexandrian astronomers, it will have been seen that their
instrumental observations could not be depended on for any close
accuracy. This defect, after the general reception of the Hipparchian
theory, operated very unfavorably on the progress of the science. If
they could have traced the moon’s place distinctly from day to day,
they must soon have discovered all the inequalities which were known
to Tycho Brahe; and if they could have measured her parallax or her
diameter with any considerable accuracy, they must have obtained a
confutation of the epicycloidal form of her orbit. By the badness of
their observations, and the imperfect agreement of these with
calculation, they not only were prevented making such steps, but were
led to receive the theory with a servile assent and an indistinct
apprehension, instead of that rational conviction and intuitive
clearness which would have given a progressive impulse to their
knowledge. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page166">166</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 4.&#8212;<i>Period from Hipparchus to
Ptolemy.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">We</span> have now to speak of the cultivators of
astronomy from the time of Hipparchus to that of Ptolemy, the next
great name which occurs in the history of this science; though even he
holds place only among those who verified, developed, and extended the
theory of Hipparchus. The astronomers who lived in the intermediate
time, indeed, did little, even in this way; though it might have been
supposed that their studies were carried on under considerable
advantages, inasmuch as they all enjoyed the liberal patronage of the
kings of Egypt.<a id="fnanchor93-3" href="#note93-3"><span
class="fnanchor">93</span></a> The “divine school of Alexandria,” as
it is called by Synesius, in the fourth century, appears to have
produced few persons capable of carrying forwards, or even of
verifying, the labors of its great astronomical teacher. The
mathematicians of the school wrote much, and apparently they observed
sometimes; but their observations are of little value; and their books
are expositions of the theory and its geometrical consequences,
without any attempt to compare it with observation. For instance, it
does not appear that any one verified the remarkable discovery of the
precession, till the time of Ptolemy, 250 years after; nor does the
statement of this motion of the heavens appear in the treatises of the
intermediate writers; nor does Ptolemy quote a single observation of
any person made in this long interval of time; while his references to
those of Hipparchus are perpetual; and to those of Aristyllus and
Timocharis, and of others, as Conon, who preceded Hipparchus, are not
unfrequent.</p>

<p>This Alexandrian period, so inactive and barren in the history of
science, was prosperous, civilized, and literary; and many of the
works which belong to it are come down to us, though those of
Hipparchus are lost. We have the “Uranologion” of Geminus,<a
id="fnanchor94-3" href="#note94-3"><span
class="fnanchor">94</span></a> a systematic treatise on Astronomy,
expounding correctly the Hipparchian Theories and their consequences,
and containing a good account of the use of the various Cycles, which
ended in the adoption of the Calippic Period. We have likewise “The
Circular Theory of the Celestial Bodies” of Cleomedes,<a
id="fnanchor95-3" href="#note95-3"><span
class="fnanchor">95</span></a> of which the principal part is a
development of the doctrine of the sphere, including the consequences
of the globular form of the earth. We have also another work on
“Spherics” by Theodosius of Bithynia,<a id="fnanchor96-3"
href="#note96-3"><span class="fnanchor">96</span></a> which contains
some of the most important propositions of the subject, and has been
used as a book of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page167">167</a></span> instruction even in modern times.
Another writer on the same subject is Menelaus, who lived somewhat
later, and whose Three Books on Spherics still remain.</p>

<p>One of the most important kinds of deduction from a geometrical
theory, such as that of the doctrine of the sphere, or that of
epicycles, is the calculation of its numerical results in particular
cases. With regard to the latter theory, this was done in the
construction of Solar and Lunar Tables, as we have already seen; and
this process required the formation of a <i>Trigonometry</i>, or
system of rules for calculating the relations between the sides and
angles of triangles. Such a science had been formed by Hipparchus, who
appears to be the author of every great step in ancient astronomy.<a
id="fnanchor97-3" href="#note97-3"><span
class="fnanchor">97</span></a> He wrote a work in twelve books, “On
the Construction of the Tables of Chords of Arcs;” such a table being
the means by which the Greeks solved their triangles. The Doctrine of
the Sphere required, in like manner, a <i>Spherical Trigonometry</i>,
in order to enable mathematicians to calculate its results; and this
branch of science also appears to have been formed by Hipparchus,<a
id="fnanchor98-3" href="#note98-3"><span
class="fnanchor">98</span></a> who gives results that imply the
possession of such a method. Hypsicles, who was a contemporary of
Ptolemy, also made some attempts at the solution of such problems: but
it is extraordinary that the writers whom we have mentioned as coming
after Hipparchus, namely, Theodosius, Cleomedes, and Menelaus, do not
even mention the calculation of triangles,<a id="fnanchor99-3"
href="#note99-3"><span class="fnanchor">99</span></a> either plain or
spherical; though the latter writer<a id="fnanchor100-3"
href="#note100-3"><span class="fnanchor">100</span></a> is said to
have written on “the Table of Chords,” a work which is now lost.</p>

<p>We shall see, hereafter, how prevalent a disposition in literary
ages is that which induces authors to become commentators. This
tendency showed itself at an early period in the school of Alexandria.
Aratus,<a id="fnanchor101-3" href="#note101-3"><span
class="fnanchor">101</span></a> who lived 270 <span class="sc">b.
c.</span> at the court of Antigonus, king of Macedonia, described the
celestial constellations in two poems, entitled “Phænomena,” and
“Prognostics.” These poems were little more than a versification of
the treatise of Eudoxus on the acronycal and heliacal risings and
settings of the stars. The work was the subject of a comment by
Hipparchus, who perhaps found this the easiest way of giving
connection and circulation to his knowledge. Three Latin translations
of this poem gave the Romans the means of becoming acquainted with it:
the first is by Cicero, of which we have numerous fragments <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page168">168</a></span> extant;<a
id="fnanchor102-3" href="#note102-3"><span
class="fnanchor">102</span></a> Germanicus Cæsar, one of the
sons-in-law of Augustus, also translated the poem, and this
translation remains almost entire. Finally, we have a complete
translation by Avienus.<a id="fnanchor103-3" href="#note103-3"><span
class="fnanchor">103</span></a> The “Astronomica” of Manilius, the
“Poeticon Astronomicon” of Hyginus, both belonging to the time of
Augustus, are, like the work of Aratus, poems which combine
mythological ornament with elementary astronomical exposition; but
have no value in the history of science. We may pass nearly the same
judgment upon the explanations and declamations of Cicero, Seneca, and
Pliny, for they do not apprise us of any additions to astronomical
knowledge; and they do not always indicate a very clear apprehension
of the doctrines which the writers adopt.</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note102-3"
href="#fnanchor102-3">102</a></span> Two copies of this translation,

<p>Perhaps the most remarkable feature in the two last-named writers,
is the declamatory expression of their admiration for the discoverers
of physical knowledge; and in one of them, Seneca, the persuasion of a
boundless progress in science to which man was destined. Though this
belief was no more than a vague and arbitrary conjecture, it suggested
other conjectures in detail, some of which, having been verified, have
attracted much notice. For instance, in speaking of comets,<a
id="fnanchor104-3" href="#note104-3"><span
class="fnanchor">104</span></a> Seneca says, “The time will come when
those things which are now hidden shall be brought to light by time
and persevering diligence. Our posterity will wonder that we should be
ignorant of what is so obvious.” “The motions of the planets,” he
adds, “complex and seemingly confused, have been reduced to rule; and
some one will come hereafter, who will reveal to us the paths of
comets.” Such convictions and conjectures are not to be admired for
their wisdom; for Seneca was led rather by enthusiasm, than by any
solid reasons, to entertain this opinion; nor, again, are they to be
considered as merely lucky guesses, implying no merit; they are
remarkable as showing how the persuasion of the universality of law,
and the belief of the probability of its discovery by man, grow up in
men’s minds, when speculative knowledge becomes a prominent object of
attention.</p>

<p>An important practical application of astronomical knowledge was
made by Julius Cæsar, in his correction of the calendar, which we have
<a href="#v1page118">already</a> noticed; and this was strictly due
to the Alexandrian School: Sosigenes, an astronomer belonging to that
school, came from Egypt to Rome for the purpose. <span

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 5.&#8212;<i>Measures of the Earth.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">There</span> were, as we have said, few attempts
made, at the period of which we are speaking, to improve the accuracy
of any of the determinations of the early Alexandrian astronomers. One
question naturally excited much attention at all times, the
<em>magnitude</em> of the earth, its figure being universally
acknowledged to be a globe. The Chaldeans, at an earlier period, had
asserted that a man, walking without stopping, might go round the
circuit of the earth in a year; but this might be a mere fancy, or a
mere guess. The attempt of Eratosthenes to decide this question went
upon principles entirely correct. Syene was situated on the tropic;
for there, on the day of the solstice, at noon, objects cast no
shadow; and a well was enlightened to the bottom by the sun’s rays. At
Alexandria, on the same day, the sun was, at noon, distant from the
zenith by a fiftieth part of the circumference. Those two cities were
north and south from each other: and the distance had been determined,
by the royal overseers of the roads, to be 5000 stadia. This gave a
circumference of 250,000 stadia to the earth, and a radius of about
40,000. Aristotle<a id="fnanchor105-3" href="#note105-3"><span
class="fnanchor">105</span></a> says that the mathematicians make the
circumference 400,000 stadia. Hipparchus conceived that the measure of
Eratosthenes ought to be increased by about one-tenth.<a
id="fnanchor106-3" href="#note106-3"><span
class="fnanchor">106</span></a> Posidonius, the friend of Cicero, made
another attempt of the same kind. At Rhodes, the star Canopus but just
appeared above the horizon; at Alexandria, the same star rose to an
altitude of  <span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>48</sub></span>th of the circumference;
the direct distance on the meridian was 5000 stadia, which gave
240,000 for the whole circuit. We cannot look upon these measures as
very precise; the stadium employed is not certainly known; and no
peculiar care appears to have been bestowed on the measure of the
direct distance.</p>

<p>When the Arabians, in the ninth century, came to be the principal
cultivators of astronomy, they repeated this observation in a manner
more suited to its real importance and capacity of exactness. Under
the Caliph Almamon,<a id="fnanchor107-3" href="#note107-3"><span
class="fnanchor">107</span></a> the vast plain of Singiar, in
Mesopotamia, was the scene of this undertaking. The Arabian
astronomers there divided themselves into two bands, one under the
direction of Chalid ben Abdolmalic, and the other having at its head
Alis ben Isa. These two parties proceeded, the one north, the other
south, determining the distance by the actual application of their
measuring-rods to the ground, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page170">170</a></span> till each was found, by astronomical
observation, to be a degree from the place at which they started. It
then appeared that these terrestrial degrees were respectively 56
miles, and 56 miles and two-thirds, the mile being 4000 cubits. In
order to remove all doubt concerning the scale of this measure, we are
informed that the cubit is that called the black cubit, which consists
of 27 inches, each inch being the thickness of six grains of
barley.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 6.&#8212;<i>Ptolemy’s Discovery of Evection.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">By</span> referring, in this place, to the
last-mentioned measure of the earth, we include the labors of the
Arabian as well as the Alexandrian astronomers, in the period of mere
detail, which forms the sequel to the great astronomical revolution of
the Hipparchian epoch. And this period of verification is rightly
extended to those later times; not merely because astronomers were
then still employed in determining the magnitude of the earth, and the
amount of other elements of the theory,&#8212;for these are some of
their employments to the present day,&#8212;but because no great
intervening discovery marks a new epoch, and begins a new
period;&#8212;because no great revolution in the theory added to the
objects of investigation, or presented them in a new point of view.
This being the case, it will be more instructive for our purpose to
consider the general character and broad intellectual features of this
period, than to offer a useless catalogue of obscure and worthless
writers, and of opinions either borrowed or unsound. But before we do
this, there is one writer whom we cannot leave undistinguished in the
crowd; since his name is more celebrated even than that of Hipparchus;
his works contain ninety-nine hundredths of what we know of the Greek
astronomy; and though he was not the author of a new theory, he made
some very remarkable steps in the verification, correction, and
extension of the theory which he received. I speak of Ptolemy, whose
work, “The Mathematical Construction” (of the heavens), contains a
complete exposition of the state of astronomy in his time, the reigns
of Adrian and Antonine. This book is familiarly known to us by a term
which contains the record of our having received our first knowledge
of it from the Arabic writers. The “<i>Megiste</i> Syntaxis,” or Great
Construction, gave rise, among them, to the title <i>Al Magisti</i>,
or <i>Almagest</i>, by which the work is commonly described. As a
mathematical exposition of the Theory of Epicycles and Eccentrics, of
the observations and calculations which were employed in <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page171">171</a></span> order to apply this
theory to the sun, moon, and planets, and of the other calculations
which are requisite, in order to deduce the consequences of this
theory, the work is a splendid and lasting monument of diligence,
skill, and judgment. Indeed, all the other astronomical works of the
ancients hardly add any thing whatever to the information we obtain
from the Almagest; and the knowledge which the student possesses of
the ancient astronomy must depend mainly upon his acquaintance with
Ptolemy. Among other merits, Ptolemy has that of giving us a very
copious account of the manner in which Hipparchus established the main
points of his theories; an account the more agreeable, in consequence
of the admiration and enthusiasm with which this author everywhere
speaks of the great master of the astronomical school.</p>
<p>In our present survey of the writings of Ptolemy, we are concerned
less with his exposition of what had been done before him, than with
his own original labors. In most of the branches of the subject, he
gave additional exactness to what Hipparchus had done; but our main
business, at present, is with those parts of the Almagest which
contain new steps in the application of the Hipparchian hypothesis.
There are two such cases, both very remarkable,&#8212;that of the
moon’s <i>Evection</i>, and that of the <i>Planetary Motions</i>.</p>
<p>The law of the moon’s anomaly, that is, of the leading and obvious
inequality of her motion, could be represented, as we have seen,
either by an eccentric or an epicycle; and the amount of this
inequality had been collected by observations of eclipses. But though
the hypothesis of an epicycle, for instance, would bring the moon to
her proper place, so far as eclipses could show it, that is, at new
and full moon, this hypothesis did not rightly represent her motions
at other points of her course. This appeared, when Ptolemy set about
measuring her distances from the sun at different times. “These,” he<a
id="fnanchor108-3" href="#note108-3"><span
class="fnanchor">108</span></a> says, “sometimes agreed, and sometimes
disagreed.” But by further attention to the facts, a rule was detected
in these differences. “As my knowledge became more complete and more
connected, so as to show the order of this new inequality, I perceived
that this difference was small, or nothing, at new and full moon; and
that at both the <em>dichotomies</em> (when the moon is half
illuminated) it was small, or nothing, if the moon was at the apogee
or perigee of the epicycle, and was greatest when she was in the
middle of the interval, and therefore when the first <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page172">172</a></span> inequality was
greatest also.” He then adds some further remarks on the circumstances
according to which the moon’s place, as affected by this new
inequality, is before or behind the place, as given by the epicyclical
hypothesis.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note108-3"
href="#fnanchor108-3">108</a></span> <i>Synth.</i> v. 2.</div>
<p>Such is the announcement of the celebrated discovery of the moon’s
second inequality, afterwards called (by Bullialdus) the
<i>Evection</i>. Ptolemy soon proceeded to represent this inequality
by a combination of circular motions, uniting, for this purpose, the
hypothesis of an epicycle, already employed to explain the first
inequality, with the hypothesis of an eccentric, in the circumference
of which the centre of the epicycle was supposed to move. The mode of
combining these was somewhat complex; more complex we may, perhaps,
say, than was absolutely requisite;<a id="fnanchor109-3"
href="#note109-3"><span class="fnanchor">109</span></a> the apogee of
the eccentric moved backwards, or contrary to the order of the signs,
and the centre of the epicycle moved forwards nearly twice as fast
upon the circumference of the eccentric, so as to reach a place
nearly, but not exactly, the same, as if it had moved in a concentric
instead of an eccentric path. Thus the centre of the epicycle went
twice round the eccentric in the course of one month: and in this
manner it satisfied the condition that it should vanish at new and
full moon, and be greatest when the moon was in the quarters of her
monthly course.<a id="fnanchor110-3" href="#note110-3"><span
class="fnanchor">110</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note109-3"
href="#fnanchor109-3">109</a></span> If Ptolemy had used the
hypothesis of an eccentric instead of an epicycle for the first
inequality of the moon, an epicycle would have represented the second
inequality more simply than his method did.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note110-3"
href="#fnanchor110-3">110</a></span> I will insert here the
explanation which my German translator, the late distinguished
astronomer Littrow, has given of this point. The Rule of this
Inequality, the Evection, may be most simply expressed thus. If
<i>a</i> denote the excess of the Moon’s Longitude over the Sun’s, and
<i>b</i> the Anomaly of the Moon reckoned from her Perigee, the
Evection is equal to <span style="white-space: nowrap;">1°. 3.sin
(2<i>a</i> &#8722; <i>b</i>).</span> At New and Full Moon, <i>a</i> is
0 or 180°, and thus the Evection is <span style="white-space:
nowrap;">&#8722; 1°.3.sin <i>b</i>.</span> At both quarters, or
dichotomies, <i>a</i> is 90° or 270°, and consequently the Evection is
<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&#43; 1°.3.sin <i>b</i>.</span> The
Moon’s Elliptical Equation of the centre is at all points of her orbit
equal to <span style="white-space: nowrap;">6°.3.sin <i>b</i>.</span>
The Greek Astronomers before Ptolemy observed the moon only at the
time of eclipses; and hence they necessarily found for the sum of
these two greatest inequalities of the moon’s motion the quantity
<span style="white-space: nowrap;">6°.3.sin <i>b</i> &#8722; 1°.3.sin
<i>b</i>,</span> or <span style="white-space: nowrap;">5°.sin
<i>b</i>:</span> and as they took this for the moon’s equation of the
centre, which depends upon the eccentricity of the moon’s orbit, we
obtain from this too small equation of the centre, an eccentricity
also smaller than the truth. Ptolemy, who first observed the moon in
her quarters, found for the sum of those Inequalities at those points
the quantity <span style="white-space: nowrap;">6°.3.sin <i>b</i>
&#43; 1°.3.sin <i>b</i>,</span> or <span style="white-space:
nowrap;">7°.6.sin <i>b</i>;</span> and thus made the eccentricity of
the moon as much too great at the quarters as the observers of
eclipses had made it too small. He hence concluded that the
eccentricity of the Moon’s orbit is variable, which is not the
case.</div>
<p>The discovery of the Evection, and the reduction of it to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page173">173</a></span> epicyclical
theory, was, for several reasons, an important step in astronomy; some
of these reasons may be stated.</p>
<p>1. It obviously suggested, or confirmed, the suspicion that the
motions of the heavenly bodies might be subject to <em>many</em>
inequalities:&#8212;that when one set of anomalies had been discovered
and reduced to rule, another set might come into view;&#8212;that the
discovery of a rule was a step to the discovery of deviations from the
rule, which would require to be expressed in other rules;&#8212;that
in the application of theory to observation, we find, not only the
<em>stated phenomena</em>, for which the theory does account, but also
<em>residual phenomena</em>, which remain unaccounted for, and stand
out beyond the calculation;&#8212;that thus nature is not simple and
regular, by conforming to the simplicity and regularity of our
hypotheses, but leads us forwards to apparent complexity, and to an
accumulation of rules and relations. A fact like the Evection,
explained by an Hypothesis like Ptolemy’s, tended altogether to
discourage any disposition to guess at the laws of nature from mere
ideal views, or from a few phenomena.</p>
<p>2. The discovery of Evection had an importance which did not come
into view till long afterwards, in being the first of a numerous
series of inequalities of the moon, which results from the
<i>Disturbing Force</i> of the sun. These inequalities were
successfully discovered; and led finally to the establishment of the
law of universal gravitation. The moon’s first inequality arises from
a different cause;&#8212;from the same cause as the inequality of the
sun’s motion;&#8212;from the motion in an ellipse, so far as the
central attraction is undisturbed by any other. This first inequality
is called the Elliptic Inequality, or, more usually, the <i>Equation
of the Centre</i>.<a id="fnanchor111-3" href="#note111-3"><span
class="fnanchor">111</span></a> All the planets have such
inequalities, but the Evection is peculiar to the moon. The discovery
of other inequalities of the moon’s motion, the Variation and Annual
Equation, made an immediate sequel in the order of the subject to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page174">174</a></span> the discoveries
of Ptolemy, although separated by a long interval of time; for these
discoveries were only made by Tycho Brahe in the sixteenth century.
The imperfection of astronomical instruments was the great cause of
this long delay.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note111-3"
href="#fnanchor111-3">111</a></span> The Equation of the Centre is the
difference between the place of the Planet in its elliptical orbit,
and that place which a Planet would have, which revolved uniformly
round the Sun as a centre in a circular orbit in the same time. An
imaginary Planet moving in the manner last described, is called the
<i>mean</i> Planet, while the actual Planet which moves in the ellipse
is called the <i>true</i> Planet. The Longitude of the mean Planet at
a given time is easily found, because its motion is uniform. By adding
to it the Equation of the Centre, we find the Longitude of the true
Planet, and thus, its place in its orbit.&#8212;<i>Littrow’s
Note</i>.<br />
&#8195;I may add that the word <i>Equation</i>, used in such cases,
denotes in general a quantity which must be added to or subtracted
from a mean quantity, to make it <em>equal</em> to the true quantity;
or rather, a quantity which must be added to or subtracted from a
variably increasing quantity to make it increase
<em>equably</em>.</div>
<p>3. The Epicyclical Hypothesis was found capable of accommodating
itself to such new discoveries. These new inequalities could be
represented by new combinations of eccentrics and epicycles: all the
real and imaginary discoveries by astronomers, up to Copernicus, were
actually embodied in these hypotheses; Copernicus, as we have said,
did not reject such hypotheses; the lunar inequalities which Tycho
detected might have been similarly exhibited; and even Newton<a
id="fnanchor112-3" href="#note112-3"><span
class="fnanchor">112</span></a> represents the motion of the moon’s
apogee by means of an epicycle. As a mode of expressing the law of the
irregularity, and of calculating its results in particular cases, the
epicyclical theory was capable of continuing to render great service
to astronomy, however extensive the progress of the science might be.
It was, in fact, as we have already said, the modern process of
representing the motion by means of a series of circular
functions.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note112-3"
href="#fnanchor112-3">112</a></span> <i>Principia</i>, lib. iii. prop.
xxxv.</div>
<p>4. But though the doctrine of eccentrics and epicycles was thus
admissible as an Hypothesis, and convenient as a means of expressing
the laws of the heavenly motions, the successive occasions on which it
was called into use, gave no countenance to it as a Theory; that is,
as a true view of the nature of these motions, and their causes. By
the steps of the progress of this Hypothesis, it became more and more
complex, instead of becoming more simple, which, as we shall see, was
the course of the true Theory. The notions concerning the position and
connection of the heavenly bodies, which were suggested by one set of
phenomena, were not confirmed by the indications of another set of
phenomena; for instance, those relations of the epicycles which were
adopted to account for the Motions of the heavenly bodies, were not
found to fall in with the consequences of their apparent Diameters and
Parallaxes. In reality, as we have <a href="#v1page161">said</a>, if the relative distances of
the sun and moon at different times could have been accurately
determined, the Theory of Epicycles must have been forthwith
overturned. The insecurity of such measurements alone maintained the
theory to later times.<a id="fnanchor113-3" href="#note113-3"><span
class="fnanchor">113</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note113-3"
href="#fnanchor113-3">113</a></span> The alteration of the apparent
diameter of the moon is so great that it cannot escape us, even with
very moderate instruments. This apparent diameter contains, when the
moon is nearest the earth, 2010 seconds; when she is furthest off 1762
seconds; that is, 248 seconds, or 4 minutes 8 seconds, less than in
the former case. [The two quantities are in the proportion of 8 to 7,
nearly.]&#8212;<i>Littrow’s Note</i>. <span class="pagenum"><a

<h4 id="b3-4-7"><i>Sect.</i> 7.&#8212;<i>Conclusion of the History of
Greek Astronomy.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">I might</span> now proceed to give an account of
Ptolemy’s other great step, the determination of the Planetary Orbits;
but as this, though in itself very curious, would not illustrate any
point beyond those already noticed, I shall refer to it very briefly.
The planets all move in ellipses about the sun, as the moon moves
about the earth; and as the sun apparently moves about the earth. They
will therefore each have an Elliptic Inequality or Equation of the
centre, for the same reason that the sun and moon have such
inequalities. And this inequality may be represented, in the cases of
the planets, just as in the other two, by means of an eccentric; the
epicycle, it will be recollected, had already been used in order to
represent the more obvious changes of the planetary motions. To
determine the amount of the Eccentricities and the places of the
Apogees of the planetary orbits, was the task which Ptolemy undertook;
Hipparchus, as we have seen, having been destitute of the observations
which such a process required. The determination of the Eccentricities
in these cases involved some peculiarities which might not at first
sight occur to the reader. The <span class="correction" title="emended
from ecliptical">elliptical</span> motion of the planets takes place
about the sun; but Ptolemy considered their movements as altogether
independent of the sun, and referred them to the earth alone; and thus
the apparent eccentricities which he had to account for, were the
compound result of the Eccentricity of the earth’s orbit, and of the
proper eccentricity of the orbit of the Planet. He explained this
result by the received mechanism of an eccentric <i>Deferent</i>,
carrying an Epicycle; but the motion in the Deferent is uniform, not
about the centre of the circle, but about another point, the
<i>Equant</i>. Without going further into detail, it may be sufficient
to state that, by a combination of Eccentrics and Epicycles, he did
account for the leading features of these motions; and by using his
own observations, compared with more ancient ones (for instance, those
of Timocharis for Venus), he was able to determine the Dimensions and
Positions of the orbits.<a id="fnanchor114-3" href="#note114-3"><span
class="fnanchor">114</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note114-3"
href="#fnanchor114-3">114</a></span> Ptolemy determined the Radius and
the Periodic Time of his two circles for each Planet in the following
manner: For the <i>inferior</i> Planets, that is, Mercury and Venus,
he took the Radius of the Deferent equal to the Radius of the Earth’s
orbit, and the Radius of the Epicycle equal to that of the Planet’s
orbit. For these Planets, according to his assumption, the Periodic
Time of the Planet in its Epicycle was to the Periodic Time of the
Epicyclical Centre on the Deferent, as the <i>synodical</i> Revolution
of the Planet to the <i>tropical</i> Revolution of the Earth above the
Sun. For the three <i>superior</i> Planets, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn,
the Radius of the Deferent was equal to the Radius of the Planet’s
orbit, and the Radius of the Epicycle was equal to the Radius of the
Earth’s orbit; the Periodic Time on the Planet in its Epicycle was to
the Periodic Time of the Epicyclical Centre on the Deferent, as the
<i>synodical</i> Revolution of the Planet to the <i>tropical</i>
Revolution of the same Planet.<br />
&#8195;Ptolemy might obviously have made the geometrical motions of all
the Planets correspond with the observations by one of these two modes
of construction; but he appears to have adopted this double form of
the theory, in order that in the inferior, as well as in the superior
Planets, he might give the smaller of the two Radii to the Epicycle:
that is, in order that he might make the smaller circle move round the
larger, not <i>vice versâ</i>.&#8212;<i>Littrow’s Notes.</i></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page176">176</a></span> I shall here
close my account of the astronomical progress of the Greek School. My
purpose is only to illustrate the principles on which the progress of
science depends, and therefore I have not at all pretended to touch
upon every part of the subject. Some portion of the ancient theories,
as, for instance, the mode of accounting for the motions of the moon
and planets in latitude, are sufficiently analogous to what has been
explained, not to require any more especial notice. Other parts of
Greek astronomical knowledge, as, for instance, their acquaintance
with refraction, did not assume any clear or definite form, and can
only be considered as the prelude to modern discoveries on the same
subject. And before we can with propriety pass on to these, there is a
long and remarkable, though unproductive interval, of which some
account must be given.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 8.&#8212;<i>Arabian Astronomy.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> interval to which I have just alluded
may be considered as extending from Ptolemy to Copernicus; we have no
advance in Greek astronomy after the former; no signs of a revival of
the power of discovery till the latter. During this interval of 1350
years,<a id="fnanchor115-3" href="#note115-3"><span
class="fnanchor">115</span></a> the principal cultivators of astronomy
were the Arabians, who adopted this science from the Greeks whom they
conquered, and from whom the conquerors of western Europe again
received back their treasure, when the love of science and the
capacity for it had been awakened in their minds. In the intervening
time, the precious deposit had undergone little change. The Arab
astronomer had been the scrupulous but unprofitable servant, who kept
his talent without apparent danger of loss, but also without prospect
of increase. There is little in <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page177">177</a></span> Arabic literature which bears upon the
<em>progress</em> of astronomy; but as the little that there is must
be considered as a sequel to the Greek science, I shall notice one or
two points before I treat of the stationary period in general.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note115-3"

class="sc">a. d.</span> 150. Copernicus was living <span class="sc">a.
d.</span> 1500.</div>
<p>When the sceptre of western Asia had passed into the hands of the
Abasside caliphs,<a id="fnanchor116-3" href="#note116-3"><span
class="fnanchor">116</span></a> Bagdad, “the city of peace,” rose to
splendor and refinement, and became the metropolis of science under
the successors of Almansor the Victorious, as Alexandria had been
under the successors of Alexander the Great. Astronomy attracted
peculiarly the favor of the powerful as well as the learned; and
almost all the culture which was bestowed upon the science, appears to
have had its source in the patronage, often also in the personal
studies, of Saracen princes. Under such encouragement, much was done,
in those scientific labors which money and rank can command.
Translations of Greek works were made, large instruments were erected,
observers were maintained; and accordingly as observation showed the
defects and imperfection of the extant tables of the celestial
motions, new ones were constructed. Thus under Almansor, the Grecian
works of science were collected from all quarters, and many of them
translated into Arabic.<a id="fnanchor117-3" href="#note117-3"><span
class="fnanchor">117</span></a> The translation of the “Megiste
Syntaxis” of Ptolemy, which thus became the Almagest, is ascribed to
Isaac ben Homain in this reign.</p>

<p>The greatest of the Arabian Astronomers comes half a century later.
This is Albategnius, as he is commonly called; or more exactly,
Mohammed ben Geber Albatani, the last appellation indicating that he
was born at Batan, a city of Mesopotamia.<a id="fnanchor118-3"
href="#note118-3"><span class="fnanchor">118</span></a> He was a
Syrian prince, whose residence was at Aracte or Racha in Mesopotamia:
a part of his observations were made at Antioch. His work still
remains to us in Latin. “After having read,” he says, “the Syntaxis of
Ptolemy, and learnt the methods of calculation employed by the Greeks,
his observations led him to conceive that some improvements might be
made in their results. He found it necessary to add to Ptolemy’s
observations as Ptolemy had added to those of Abrachis” (Hipparchus).
He then published Tables of the motions of the sun, moon, and planets,
which long maintained a high reputation.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note118-3"
href="#fnanchor118-3">118</a></span> Del. <i>Astronomie du Moyen
Age</i>, 4.</div>
<p>These, however, did not prevent the publication of others. Under
the Caliph Hakem (about <span class="sc">a. d.</span> 1000) Ebon
Iounis published Tables of the Sun, Moon, and Planets, which were
hence called the <i>Hakemite Tables</i>. Not long after, Arzachel of
Toledo published the <i>Toletan</i> <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page178">178</a></span> Tables. In the 13th century, Nasir Eddin
published Tables of the Stars, dedicated to Ilchan, a Tartar prince,
and hence termed the <i>Ilchanic</i> Tables. Two centuries later,
Ulugh Beigh, the grandson of Tamerlane, and prince of the countries
beyond the Oxus, was a zealous practical astronomer; and his Tables,
which were published in Europe by Hyde in 1665, are referred to as
important authority by modern astronomers. The series of Astronomical
Tables which we have thus noticed, in which, however, many are
omitted, leads us to the <i>Alphonsine</i> Tables, which were put
forth in 1488, and in succeeding years, under the auspices of
Alphonso, king of Castile; and thus brings us to the verge of modern
astronomy.</p>
<p>For all these Tables, the Ptolemaic hypotheses were employed; and,
for the most part, without alteration. The Arabs sometimes felt the
extreme complexity and difficulty of the doctrine which they studied;
but their minds did not possess that kind of invention and energy by
which the philosophers of Europe, at a later period, won their way
into a simpler and better system.</p>
<p>Thus Alpetragius states, in the outset of his “Planetarum
Theorica,” that he was at first astonished and stupefied with this
complexity, but that afterwards “God was pleased to open to him the
occult secret in the theory of his orbs, and to make known to him the
truth of their essence and the rectitude of the quality of their
motion.” His system consists, according to Delambre,<a
id="fnanchor119-3" href="#note119-3"><span
class="fnanchor">119</span></a> in attributing to the planets a spiral
motion from east to west, an idea already refuted by Ptolemy. Geber of
Seville criticises Ptolemy very severely,<a id="fnanchor120-3"
href="#note120-3"><span class="fnanchor">120</span></a> but without
introducing any essential alteration into his system. The Arabian
observations are in many cases valuable; both because they were made
with more skill and with better instruments than those of the Greeks;
and also because they illustrate the permanence or variability of
important elements, such as the obliquity of the ecliptic and the
inclination of the moon’s orbit.</p>

<p>We must, however, notice one or two peculiar Arabian doctrines. The
most important of these is the discovery of the Motion of the Son’s
Apogee by Albategnius. He found the Apogee to be in longitude 82
degrees; Ptolemy had placed it in longitude 65 degrees. The difference
of 17 degrees was beyond all limit of probable error of calculation,
though the process is not capable of great precision; and the
inference of the Motion of the Apogee was so obvious, that we cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page179">179</a></span> agree with
Delambre, in doubting or extenuating the claim of Albategnius to this
discovery, on the ground of his not having expressly stated it.</p>
<p>In detecting this motion, the Arabian astronomers reasoned rightly
from facts well observed: they were not always so fortunate. Arzachel,
in the 11th century, found the apogee of the sun to be less advanced
than Albategnius had found it, by some degrees; he inferred that it
had receded in the intermediate time; but we now know, from an
acquaintance with its real rate of moving, that the true inference
would have been, that Albategnius, whose method was less trustworthy
than that of Arzachel, had made an error to the amount of the
difference thus arising. A curious, but utterly false hypothesis was
founded on observations thus erroneously appreciated; namely, the
<i>Trepidation of the fixed stars</i>. Arzachel conceived that a
uniform Precession of the equinoctial points would not account for the
apparent changes of position of the stars, and that for this purpose,
it was necessary to conceive two circles of about eight degrees radius
described round the equinoctial points of the immovable sphere, and to
suppose the first points of Aries and Libra to describe the
circumference of these circles in about 800 years. This would produce,
at one time a progression, and at another a regression, of the
apparent equinoxes, and would moreover change the latitude of the
stars. Such a motion is entirely visionary; but the doctrine made a
sect among astronomers, and was adopted in the first edition of the
Alphonsine Tables, though afterwards rejected.</p>
<p>An important exception to the general unprogressive character of
Arabian science has been pointed out recently by M. Sedillot.<a
id="fnanchor121-3" href="#note121-3"><span
class="fnanchor">121</span></a> It appears that Mohammed-Aboul
Wefa-al-Bouzdjani, an Arabian astronomer of the tenth century, who
resided at Cairo, and observed at Bagdad in 975, discovered a third
inequality of the moon, in addition to the two expounded by Ptolemy,
the Equation of the Centre, and the Evection. This third inequality,
the <i>Variation</i>, is usually supposed to have been discovered by
Tycho Brahe, six centuries later. It is an inequality of the moon’s
motion, in virtue of which she moves quickest when she is at new or
full, and slowest at the first and third quarter; in consequence of
this, from the first quarter to the full, she is behind her mean
place; at the full, she does not differ from her mean place; from the
full to the third quarter, she is before her true <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page180">180</a></span> place; and so on; and
the greatest effect of the inequality is in the <i>octants</i>, or
points half-way between the four quarters. In an Almagest of Aboul
Wefa, a part of which exists in the Royal Library at Paris, after
describing the two inequalities of the moon, he has a Section ix., “Of
the Third Anomaly of the moon called <i>Muhazal</i> or
<i>Prosneusis</i>.” He there says, that taking cases when the moon was
in apogee or perigee, and when, consequently, the effect of the two
first inequalities vanishes, he found, <em>by observation of the
moon</em>, when she was nearly <i>in trine</i> and <i>in sextile</i>
with the sun, that she was a degree and a quarter from her calculated
place. “And hence,” he adds, “I perceived that this anomaly exists
independently of the two first: and this can only take place by a
declination of the diameter of the epicycle with respect to the centre
of the zodiac.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note121-3"
href="#fnanchor121-3">121</a></span> Sedillot, Nouvelles Rech. sur
l’Hist. de l’Astron. chez les Arabes. <i>Nouveau Journal
Asiatique</i>. 1836.</div>
<p>We may remark that we have here this inequality of the moon made
out in a really philosophical manner; a residual quantity in the
moon’s longitude being detected by observation, and the cases in which
it occurs selected and grouped by an inductive effort of the mind. The
advance is not great; for Aboul Wefa appears only to have detected the
existence, and not to have fixed the law or the exact quantity of the
inequality; but still it places the scientific capacity of the Arabs
in a more favorable point of view than any circumstance with which we
were previously acquainted.</p>
<p>But this discovery of Aboul Wefa appears to have excited no notice
among his contemporaries and followers: at least it had been long
quite forgotten when Tycho Brahe rediscovered the same lunar
inequality. We can hardly help looking upon this circumstance as an
evidence of a servility of intellect belonging to the Arabian period.
The learned Arabians were so little in the habit of considering
science as progressive, and looking with pride and confidence at
examples of its progress, that they had not the courage to believe in
a discovery which they themselves had made, and were dragged back by
the chain of authority, even when they had advanced beyond their Greek
masters.</p>
<p>As the Arabians took the whole of their theory (with such slight
exceptions as we have been noticing) from the Greeks, they took from
them also the mathematical processes by which the consequences of the
theory were obtained. Arithmetic and Trigonometry, two main branches
of these processes, received considerable improvements at their hands.
In the former, especially, they rendered a service to the world which
it is difficult to estimate too highly, in abolishing the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page181">181</a></span> cumbrous Sexagesimal
Arithmetic of the Greeks, and introducing the notation by means of the
digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, which we now employ.<a
id="fnanchor122-3" href="#note122-3"><span
class="fnanchor">122</span></a> These numerals appear to be of Indian
origin, as is acknowledged by the Arabs themselves; and thus form no
exception to the sterility of the Arabian genius as to great
scientific inventions. Another improvement, of a subordinate kind, but
of great utility, was Arabian, being made by Albategnius. He
introduced into calculation the <i>sine</i>, or half-chord of the
double arc, instead of the chord of the arc itself, which had been
employed by the Greek astronomers. There have been various conjectures
concerning the origin of the word <i>sine</i>; the most probable
appears to be that <i>sinus</i> is the Latin translation of the Arabic
word <i>gib</i>, which signifies a fold, the two halves of the chord
being conceived to be folded together.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note122-3"
href="#fnanchor122-3">122</a></span> Mont. i. 376.</div>
<p>The great obligation which Science owes to the Arabians, is to have
preserved it during a period of darkness and desolation, so that
Europe might receive it back again when the evil days were past. We
shall see hereafter how differently the European intellect dealt with
this hereditary treasure when once recovered.</p>
<p>Before quitting the subject, we may observe that Astronomy brought
back, from her sojourn among the Arabs, a few terms which may still be
perceived in her phraseology. Such are the <i>zenith</i>, and the
opposite imaginary point, the <i>nadir</i>;&#8212;the circles of the
sphere termed <i>almacantars</i> and <i>azimuth</i> circles. The
<i>alidad</i> of an instrument is its index, which possesses an
angular motion. Some of the stars still retain their Arabic names;
<i>Aldebran</i>, <i>Rigel</i>, <i>Fomalhaut</i>; many others were
known by such appellations a little while ago. Perhaps the word
<i>almanac</i> is the most familiar vestige of the Arabian period of
astronomy.</p>
<hr class="one above" />
<p>It is foreign to my purpose to note any efforts of the intellectual
faculties among other nations, which may have taken place
independently of the great system of progressive European culture,
from which all our existing science is derived. Otherwise I might
speak of the astronomy of some of the Orientals, for example, the
Chinese, who are said, by Montucla (i. 465), to have discovered the
first equation of the moon, and the proper motion of the fixed stars
(the Precession), in the third century of our era. The Greeks had made
these discoveries 500 years earlier.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">WE</span> have now to consider more
especially a long and barren period, which intervened between the
scientific activity of ancient Greece and that of modern Europe; and
which we may, therefore, call the Stationary Period of Science. It
would be to no purpose to enumerate the various forms in which, during
these times, men reproduced the discoveries of the inventive ages; or
to trace in them the small successes of Art, void of any principle of
genuine Philosophy. Our object requires rather that we should point
out the general and distinguishing features of the intellect and
habits of those times. We must endeavor to delineate the character of
the Stationary Period, and, as far as possible, to analyze its defects
and errors; and thus obtain some knowledge of the causes of its
barrenness and darkness.</p>
<p>We have already stated, that real scientific progress requires
distinct general Ideas, applied to many special and certain Facts. In
the period of which we now have to speak, men’s Ideas were obscured;
their disposition to bring their general views into accordance with
Facts was enfeebled. They were thus led to employ themselves
unprofitably, among indistinct and unreal notions. And the evil of
these tendencies was further inflamed by moral peculiarities in the
character of those times;&#8212;by an abjectness of thought on the one
hand, which could not help looking towards some intellectual superior,
and by an impatience of dissent on the other. To this must be added an
enthusiastic temper, which, when introduced into speculation, tends to
subject the mind’s operations to ideas altogether distorted and
delusive.</p>
<p>These characteristics of the stationary period, its obscurity of
thought, its servility, its intolerant disposition, and its
enthusiastic temper, will be treated of in the four following
chapters, on the Indistinctness of Ideas, the Commentatorial Spirit,
the Dogmatism, and the Mysticism of the Middle Ages.  ~Additional
material in the <a href="#v1page511">3rd edition</a>.~ <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page186">186</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER I.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">On the Indistinctness of Ideas of the Middle
Ages.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THAT</span> firm and entire
possession of certain clear and distinct general ideas which is
necessary to sound science, was the character of the minds of those
among the ancients who created the several sciences which arose among
them. It was indispensable that such inventors should have a luminous
and steadfast apprehension of certain general relations, such as those
of space and number, order and cause; and should be able to apply
these notions with perfect readiness and precision to special facts
and cases. It is necessary that such scientific notions should be more
definite and precise than those which common language conveys; and in
this state of unusual clearness, they must be so familiar to the
philosopher, that they are the language in which he thinks. The
discoverer is thus led to doctrines which other men adopt and follow
out, in proportion as they seize the fundamental ideas, and become
acquainted with the leading facts. Thus Hipparchus, conceiving clearly
the motions and combinations of motion which enter into his theory,
saw that the relative lengths of the seasons were sufficient data for
determining the form of the sun’s orbit; thus Archimedes, possessing a
steady notion of mechanical pressure, was able, not only to deduce the
properties of the lever and of the centre of gravity, but also to see
the truth of those principles respecting the distribution of pressure
in fluids, on which the science of hydrostatics depends.</p>
<p>With the progress of such distinct ideas, the inductive sciences
rise and flourish; with the decay and loss of such distinct ideas,
these sciences become stationary, languid, and retrograde. When men
merely repeat the terms of science, without attaching to them any
clear conceptions;&#8212;when their apprehensions become vague and
dim;&#8212;when they assent to scientific doctrines as a matter of
tradition, rather than of conviction, on trust rather than on
sight;&#8212;when science is considered as a collection of opinions,
rather than a record of laws by which the universe is really
governed;&#8212;it must inevitably happen, that men will lose their
hold on the knowledge which the great discoverers who preceded them
have brought to light. They are not able to push forwards the truths
on which they lay so <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page187">187</a></span> feeble and irresolute a hand; probably
they cannot even prevent their sliding back towards the obscurity from
which they had been drawn, or from being lost altogether. Such
indistinctness and vacillation of thought appear to have prevailed in
the stationary period, and to be, in fact, intimately connected with
its stationary character. I shall point out some indications of the
intellectual peculiarity of which I speak.</p>
<p>1. <i>Collections of Opinions.</i>&#8212;The fact, that mere
Collections of the opinions of physical philosophers came to hold a
prominent place in literature, already indicated a tendency to an
indistinct and wandering apprehension of such opinions. I speak of
such works as Plutarch’s five Books “on the Opinions of Philosophers,”
or the physical opinions which Diogenes Laërtius gives in his “Lives
of the Philosophers.” At an earlier period still, books of this kind
appear; as for instance, a large portion of Pliny’s Natural History, a
work which has very appropriately been called the Encyclopædia of
Antiquity; even Aristotle himself is much in the habit of enumerating
the opinions of those who had preceded him. To present such statements
as an important part of physical philosophy, shows an erroneous and
loose apprehension of its nature. For the only proof of which its
doctrines admit, is the possibility of applying the general theory to
each particular case; the authority of great men, which in moral and
practical matters may or must have its weight, is here of no force;
and the technical precision of ideas which the terms of a sound
physical theory usually demand, renders a mere statement of the
doctrines very imperfectly intelligible to readers familiar with
common notions only. To dwell upon such collections of opinions,
therefore, both implies, and produces, in writers and readers, an
obscure and inadequate apprehension of the full meaning of the
doctrines thus collected; supposing there be among them any which
really possess such a clearness, solidity, and reality, as to make
them important in the history of science. Such diversities of opinion
convey no truth; such a multiplicity of statements of what has been
<em>said</em>, in no degree teaches us what <em>is</em>; such
accumulations of indistinct notions, however vast and varied, do not
make up one distinct idea. On the contrary, the habit of dwelling upon
the verbal expressions of the views of other persons, and of being
content with such an apprehension of doctrines as a transient notice
can give us, is fatal to firm and clear thought: it indicates wavering
and feeble conceptions, which are inconsistent with speculation. <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page188">188</a></span></p>
<p>We may, therefore, consider the prevalence of Collections of the
kind just referred to, as indicating a deficiency of philosophical
talent in the ages now under review. As evidence of the same
character, we may add the long train of publishers of Abstracts,
Epitomes, Bibliographical Notices, and similar writers. All such
writers are worthless for all purposes of <em>science</em>, and their
labors may be considered as dead works; they have in them no principle
of philosophical vitality; they draw their origin and nutriment from
the death of true physical knowledge; and resemble the swarms of
insects that are born from the perishing carcass of some noble
animal.</p>
<p>2. <i>Indistinctness of Ideas in Mechanics.</i>&#8212;But the
indistinctness of thought which is so fatal a feature in the intellect
of the stationary period, may be traced more directly in the works,
even of the best authors, of those times. We find that they did not
retain steadily the ideas on which the scientific success of the
previous period had depended. For instance, it is a remarkable
circumstance in the history of the science of Mechanics, that it did
not make any advance from the time of Archimedes to that of Stevinus
and Galileo. Archimedes had established the doctrine of the lever;
several persons tried, in the intermediate time, to prove the property
of the inclined plane, and none of them succeeded. But let us look to
the attempts; for example, that of Pappus, in the eighth Book of his
Mathematical Collections, and we may see the reason of the failure.
His Problem shows, in the very terms in which it is propounded, the
want of a clear apprehension of the subject. “Having given the power
which will draw a given weight along the horizontal plane, to find the
additional power which will draw the same weight along a given
inclined plane.” This is proposed without previously defining how
Powers, producing such effects, are to be measured; and as if the
speed with which the body were drawn, and the nature of the surface of
the plane, were of no consequence. The proper elementary Problem is,
To find the force which will <em>support</em> a body on a smooth
inclined plane; and no doubt the solution of Pappus has more reference
to this problem than to his own. His reasoning is, however, totally at
variance with mechanical ideas on any view of the problem. He supposes
the weight to be formed into a sphere; and this sphere being placed in
contact with the inclined plane, he assumes that the effect will be
the same as if the weight were supported on a horizontal lever, the
fulcrum being the point of contact of the sphere with the plane, and
the power acting at the circumference of the sphere. Such an
assumption implies an entire <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page189">189</a></span> absence of those distinct ideas of force
and mechanical pressure, on which our perception of the identity or
difference of different modes of action must depend;&#8212;of those
ideas by the help of which Archimedes had been able to demonstrate the
properties of the lever, and Stevinus afterwards discovered the true
solution of the problem of the inclined plane. The motive to Pappus’s
assumption was probably no more than this;&#8212;he perceived that the
additional power, which he thus obtained, vanished when the plane
became horizontal, and increased as the inclination became greater.
Thus his views were vague; he had no clear conception of mechanical
action, and he tried a geometrical conjecture. This is not the way to
real knowledge.</p>
<p>Pappus (who lived about <span class="sc">a. d.</span> 400) was one
of the best mathematicians of the Alexandrian school; and, on subjects
where his ideas were so indistinct, it is not likely that any much
clearer were to be found in the minds of his contemporaries.
Accordingly, on all subjects of speculative mechanics, there appears
to have been an entire confusion and obscurity of thought till modern
times. Men’s minds were busy in endeavoring to systematize the
distinctions and subtleties of the Aristotelian school, concerning
Motion and Power; and, being thus employed among doctrines in which
there was involved no definite meaning capable of real
exemplification, they, of course, could not acquire sound physical
knowledge. We have already seen that the physical opinions of
Aristotle, even as they came from him, had no proper scientific
precision. His followers, in their endeavors to perfect and develop
his statements, never attempted to introduce clearer ideas than those
of their master; and as they never referred, in any steady manner, to
facts, the vagueness of their notions was not corrected by any
collision with observation. The physical doctrines which they
extracted from Aristotle were, in the course of time, built up into a
regular system; and though these doctrines could not be followed into
a practical application without introducing distinctions and changes,
such as deprived the terms of all steady signification, the dogmas
continued to be repeated, till the world was persuaded that they were
self-evident; and when, at a later period, experimental philosophers,
such as Galileo and Boyle, ventured to contradict these current
maxims, their new principles sounded in men’s ears as strange as they
now sound familiar. Thus Boyle promulgated his opinions on the
mechanics of fluids, as “Hydrostatical <em>Paradoxes</em>, proved and
illustrated by experiments.” And the opinions which he there opposes,
are those which the Aristotelian philosophers habitually propounded as
certain <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page190">190</a></span> and
indisputable; such, for instance, as that “in fluids the upper parts
do not gravitate on the lower;” that “a lighter fluid will not
gravitate on a heavier;” that “levity is a positive quality of bodies
as well as gravity.” So long as these assertions were left uncontested
and untried, men heard and repeated them, without perceiving the
incongruities which they involved: and thus they long evaded
refutation, amid the vague notions and undoubting habits of the
stationary period. But when the controversies of Galileo’s time had
made men think with more acuteness and steadiness, it was discovered
that many of these doctrines were inconsistent with themselves, as
well as with experiment. We have an example of the confusion of
thought to which the Aristotelians were liable, in their doctrine
concerning falling bodies. “Heavy bodies,” said they, “must fall
quicker than light ones; for weight is the cause of their fall, and
the weight of the greater bodies is greater.” They did not perceive
that, if they considered the weight of the body as a power acting to
produce motion, they must consider the body itself as offering a
resistance to motion; and that the effect must depend on the
proportion of the power to the resistance; in short, they had no clear
idea of <em>accelerating force</em>. This defect runs through all
their mechanical speculations, and renders them entirely
valueless.</p>
<p>We may exemplify the same confusion of thought on mechanical
subjects in writers of a less technical character. Thus, if men had
any distinct idea of mechanical action, they could not have accepted
for a moment the fable of the Echineis or Remora, a little fish which
was said to be able to stop a large ship merely by sticking to it.<a
id="fnanchor1-4" href="#note1-4"><span class="fnanchor">1</span></a>
Lucan refers to this legend in a poetical manner, and notices this
creature only in bringing together a collection of monstrosities; but
Pliny relates the tale gravely, and moralizes upon it after his
manner. “What,” he cries,<a id="fnanchor2-4" href="#note2-4"><span
class="fnanchor">2</span></a> “is more violent than the sea and the
winds? what a greater work of art than a ship? Yet one little fish
(the Echineis) can hold back all these when they all strain the same
way. The winds may <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page191">191</a></span> blow, the waves may rage; but this small
creature controls their fury, and stops a vessel, when chains and
anchors would not hold it: and this it does, not by hard labor, but
merely by adhering to it. Alas, for human vanity! when the turreted
ships which man has built, that he may fight from castle-walls, at sea
as well as at land, are held captive and motionless by a fish a foot
and a half long! Such a fish is said to have stopped the admiral’s
ship at the battle of Actium, and compelled Antony to go into another.
And in our own memory, one of these animals held fast the ship of
Caius, the emperor, when he was sailing from Astura to Antium. The
stopping of this ship, when all the rest of the fleet went on, caused
surprise; but this did not last long, for some of the men jumped into
the water to look for the fish, and found it sticking to the rudder;
they showed it to Caius, who was indignant that this animal should
interpose its prohibition to his progress, when impelled by four
hundred rowers. It was like a slug; and had no power, after it was
taken into the ship.”</p>

<p>A very little advance in the power of thinking clearly on the force
which it exerted in pulling, would have enabled the Romans to see that
the ship and its rowers must pull the adhering fish by the hold the
oars had upon the water; and that, except the fish had a hold equally
strong on some external body, it could not resist this force.</p>
<p>3. <i>Indistinctness of Ideas shown in
Architecture.</i>&#8212;Perhaps it may serve to illustrate still
further the extent to which, under the Roman empire, men’s notions of
mechanical relations became faint, wavered, and disappeared, if we
observe the change which took place in architecture. All architecture,
to possess genuine beauty, must be mechanically consistent. The
decorative members must represent a structure which has in it a
principle of support and stability. Thus the Grecian colonnade was a
straight horizontal beam, resting on vertical props; and the pediment
imitated a frame like a roof, where oppositely inclined beams support
each other. These forms of building were, therefore, proper models of
art, because they implied supporting forces. But to be content with
colonnades and pediments, which, though they imitated the forms of the
Grecian ones, were destitute of their mechanical truth, belonged to
the decline of art; and showed that men had lost the idea of force,
and retained only that of shape. Yet this was what the architects of
the Roman empire did. Under their hands, the pediment was severed at
its vertex, and divided into separate halves, so that it was no longer
a mechanical possibility. The entablature no longer lay straight from
pillar to pillar, but, projecting over each <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page192">192</a></span> column, turned back to the wall, and
adhered to it in the intervening space. The splendid remains of
Palmyra, Balbec, Petra, exhibit endless examples of this kind of
perverse inventiveness; and show us, very instructively, how the decay
of art and of science alike accompany this indistinctness of ideas
which we are now endeavoring to illustrate.</p>
<p>4. <i>Indistinctness of Ideas in Astronomy.</i>&#8212;Returning to
the sciences, it may be supposed, at first sight, that, with regard to
astronomy, we have not the same ground for charging the stationary
period with indistinctness of ideas on that subject, since they were
able to acquire and verify, and, in some measure, to apply, the
doctrines previously established. And, undoubtedly, it must be
confessed that men’s notions of the relations of space and number are
never very indistinct. It appears to be impossible for these chains of
elementary perception ever to be much entangled. The later Greeks, the
Arabians, and the earliest modern astronomers, must have conceived the
hypotheses of the Ptolemaic system with tolerable completeness. And
yet, we may assert, that during the stationary period, men did not
possess the notions, even of space and number, in that vivid and
vigorous manner which enables them to discover new truths. If they had
perceived distinctly that the astronomical theorist had merely to do
with <em>relative</em> motions, they must have been led to see the
possibility, at least, of the Copernican system; as the Greeks, at an
earlier period, had already perceived it. We find no trace of this.
Indeed, the mode in which the Arabian mathematicians present the
solutions of their problems, does not indicate that clear apprehension
of the relations of space, and that delight in the contemplation of
them, which the Greek geometrical speculations imply. The Arabs are in
the habit of giving conclusions without demonstrations, precepts
without the investigations by which they are obtained; as if their
main object were practical rather than speculative,&#8212;the
calculation of results rather than the exposition of theory.
Delambre<a id="fnanchor3-4" href="#note3-4"><span
class="fnanchor">3</span></a> has been obliged to exercise great
ingenuity, in order to discover the method by which Ibn Iounis proved
his solution of certain difficult problems.</p>

<p>5. <i>Indistinctness of Ideas shown by Skeptics.</i>&#8212;The same
unsteadiness of ideas which prevents men from obtaining clear views,
and steady and just convictions, on special subjects, may lead them to
despair of or deny the possibility of acquiring certainty at all, and
may thus make them skeptics with regard to all knowledge. Such
skeptics <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page193">193</a></span> are
themselves men of indistinct views, for they could not otherwise avoid
assenting to the demonstrated truths of science; and, so far as they
may be taken as specimens of their contemporaries, they prove that
indistinct ideas prevail in the age in which they appear. In the
stationary period, moreover, the indefinite speculations and
unprofitable subtleties of the schools might further impel a man of
bold and acute mind to this universal skepticism, because they offered
nothing which could fix or satisfy him. And thus the skeptical spirit
may deserve our notice as indicative of the defects of a system of
doctrine too feeble in demonstration to control such resistance.</p>
<p>The most remarkable of these philosophical skeptics is Sextus
Empiricus; so called, from his belonging to that medical sect which
was termed the <i>empirical</i>, in contradistinction to the
<i>rational</i> and <i>methodical</i> sects. His works contain a
series of treatises, directed against all the divisions of the science
of his time. He has chapters against the Geometers, against the
Arithmeticians, against the Astrologers, against the Musicians, as
well as against Grammarians, Rhetoricians, and Logicians; and, in
short, as a modern writer has said, his skepticism is employed as a
sort of frame-work which embraces an encyclopedical view of human
knowledge. It must be stated, however, that his objections are rather
to the metaphysical grounds, than to the details of the sciences; he
rather denies the possibility of speculative truth in general, than
the experimental truths which had been then obtained. Thus his
objections to geometry and arithmetic are founded on abstract cavils
concerning the nature of points, letters, unities, &amp;c. And when he
comes to speak against astrology, he says, “I am not going to consider
that perfect science which rests upon geometry and arithmetic; for I
have already shown the weakness of those sciences: nor that faculty of
prediction (of the motions of the heavens) which belongs to the pupils
of Eudoxus, and Hipparchus, and the rest, which some call Astronomy;
for that is an observation of phenomena, like agriculture or
navigation: but against the Art of Prediction from the time of birth,
which the Chaldeans exercise.” Sextus, therefore, though a skeptic by
profession, was not insensible to the difference between experimental
knowledge and mystical dogmas, though even the former had nothing
which excited his admiration.</p>
<p>The skepticism which denies the evidence of the truths of which the
best established physical sciences consist, must necessarily involve a
very indistinct apprehension of those truths; for such truths,
properly exhibited, contain their own evidence, and are the best
antidote <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page194">194</a></span> to
this skepticism. But an incredulity or contempt towards the asserted
truths of physical science may arise also from the attention being
mainly directed to the certainty and importance of religious truths. A
veneration for revealed religion may thus assume the aspect of a
skepticism with regard to natural knowledge. Such appears to be the
case with Algazel or Algezeli, who is adduced by Degerando<a
id="fnanchor4-4" href="#note4-4"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a>
as an example of an Arabian skeptic. He was a celebrated teacher at
Bagdad in the eleventh century, and he declared himself the enemy, not
only of the mixed Peripatetic and Platonic philosophy of the time, but
of Aristotle himself. His work entitled <i>The Destructions of the
Philosophers</i>, is known to us by the refutation of it which
Averrhoes published, under the title of <i>Destruction of Algazel’s
Destructions of the Philosophers</i>. It appears that he contested the
fundamental principles both of the Platonic and of the Aristotelian
schools, and denied the possibility of a known connection between
cause and effect; thus making a prelude, says Degerando, to the
celebrated argumentation of Hume.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note4-4"
href="#fnanchor4-4">4</a></span> Degerando, <i>Hist. Comp. de
Systèmes</i>, iv. 224.</div>
<p>[2d Ed.] Since the publication of my first edition, an account of
Algazel or Algazzali and his works has been published under the title
of <i>Essai sur les Ecoles Philosophiques chez les Arabes, et
notamment sur la Doctrine d’Algazzali</i>, par August Schmölders.
Paris. 1842. From this book it appears that Degerando’s account of
Algazzali is correct, when he says<a id="fnanchor5-4"
href="#note5-4"><span class="fnanchor">5</span></a> that “his
skepticism seems to have essentially for its object to destroy all
systems of merely rational theology, in order to open an indefinite
career, not only to faith guided by revelation, but also to the free
exaltation of a mystical enthusiasm.” It is remarked by Dr.
Schmölders, following M. de Hammer-Purgstall, that the title of the
work referred to in the text ought rather to be <i>Mutual Refutation
of the Philosophers</i>: and that its object is to show that
Philosophy consists of a mass of systems, each of which overturns the
others. The work of Algazzali which Dr. Schmölders has published,
<i>On the Errors of Sects, &amp;c.</i>, contains a kind of
autobiographical account of the way in which the author was led to his
views. He does not reject the truths of science, but he condemns the
mental habits which are caused by laying too much stress upon science.
Religious men, he says, are, by such a course, led to reject all
science, even what relates to eclipses of the moon and sun; and men of
science are led to hate religion.<a id="fnanchor6-4"

<i>Neglect of Physical Reasoning in Christendom.</i>&#8212;If the
Arabians, who, during the ages of which we are speaking, were the most
eminent cultivators of science, entertained only such comparatively
feeble and servile notions of its doctrines, it will easily be
supposed, that in the Christendom of that period, where physical
knowledge was comparatively neglected, there was still less
distinctness and vividness in the prevalent ideas on such subjects.
Indeed, during a considerable period of the history of the Christian
Church, and by many of its principal authorities, the study of natural
philosophy was not only disregarded but discommended. The great
practical doctrines which were presented to men’s minds, and the
serious tasks, of the regulation of the will and affections, which
religion impressed upon them, made inquiries of mere curiosity seem to
be a reprehensible misapplication of human powers; and many of the
fathers of the Church revived, in a still more peremptory form, the
opinion of Socrates, that the only valuable philosophy is that which
teaches us our moral duties and religious hopes.<a id="fnanchor7-4"
href="#note7-4"><span class="fnanchor">7</span></a> Thus Eusebius
says,<a id="fnanchor8-4" href="#note8-4"><span
class="fnanchor">8</span></a> “It is not through ignorance of the
things admired by them, but through contempt of their useless labor,
that we think little of these matters, turning our souls to the
exercise of better things.” When the thoughts were thus intentionally
averted from those ideas which natural philosophy involves, the ideas
inevitably became very indistinct in their minds; and they could not
conceive that any other persons could find, on such subjects, grounds
of clear conviction and certainty. They held the whole of their
philosophy to be, as Lactantius<a id="fnanchor9-4"
href="#note9-4"><span class="fnanchor">9</span></a> asserts it to be,
“empty and false.” “To search,” says he, “for the causes of natural
things; to inquire whether the sun be as large as he seems, whether
the moon is convex or concave, whether the stars are fixed in the sky
or float freely in the air; of what size and of what material are the
heavens; whether they be at rest or in motion; what is the magnitude
of the earth; on what foundations it is suspended and
balanced;&#8212;to dispute and conjecture on such matters, is just as
if we chose to discuss what we think of a city in a remote country, of
which we never heard but the name.” It is impossible to express more
forcibly that absence of any definite notions on physical subjects
which led to this tone of thought.</p>

<p>7. <i>Question of Antipodes.</i>&#8212;With such habits of thought,
we are not to be surprised if the relations resulting from the best
established theories were apprehended in an imperfect and incongruous
manner. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page196">196</a></span> We have
some remarkable examples of this; and a very notable one is the
celebrated question of the existence of <i>Antipodes</i>, or persons
inhabiting the opposite side of the globe of the earth, and
consequently having the soles of their feet directly opposed to ours.
The doctrine of the globular form of the earth results, as we have
seen, by a geometrical necessity, from a clear conception of the
various points of knowledge which we obtain, bearing upon that
subject. This doctrine was held distinctly by the Greeks; it was
adopted by all astronomers, Arabian and European, who followed them;
and was, in fact, an inevitable part of every system of astronomy
which gave a consistent and intelligible representation of phenomena.
But those who did not call before their minds any distinct
representation at all, and who referred the whole question to other
relations than those of space, might still deny this doctrine; and
they did so. The existence of inhabitants on the opposite side of the
terraqueous globe, was a fact of which experience alone could teach
the truth or falsehood; but the religious relations, which extend
alike to all mankind, were supposed to give the Christian philosopher
grounds for deciding against the possibility of such a race of men.
Lactantius,<a id="fnanchor10-4" href="#note10-4"><span
class="fnanchor">10</span></a> in the fourth century, argues this
matter in a way very illustrative of that impatience of such
speculations, and consequent confusion of thought, which we have
mentioned. “Is it possible,” he says, “that men can be so absurd as to
believe that the crops and trees on the other side of the earth hang
downwards, and that men there have their feet higher than their heads?
If you ask of them how they defend these monstrosities&#8212;how
things do not fall away from the earth on that side&#8212;they reply,
that the nature of things is such that heavy bodies tend towards the
centre, like the spokes of a wheel, while light bodies, as clouds,
smoke, fire, tend from the centre towards the heavens on all sides.
Now I am really at a loss what to say of those who, when they have
once gone wrong, steadily persevere in their folly, and defend one
absurd opinion by another.” It is obvious that so long as the writer
refused to admit into his thoughts the fundamental conception of their
theory, he must needs be at a loss what to say to their arguments
without being on that account in any degree convinced of their
doctrines.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note10-4"
href="#fnanchor10-4">10</a></span> <i>Inst.</i> 1. iii. 23.</div>
<p>In the sixth century, indeed, in the reign of Justinian, we find a
writer (Cosmas Indicopleustes<a id="fnanchor11-4"
href="#note11-4"><span class="fnanchor">11</span></a>) who does not
rest in this obscurity of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page197">197</a></span> representation; but in this case, the
distinctness of the pictures only serves to show his want of any clear
conception as to what suppositions would explain the phenomena. He
describes the earth as an oblong floor, surrounded by upright walls,
and covered by a vault, below which the heavenly bodies perform their
revolutions, going round a certain high mountain, which occupies the
northern parts of the earth, and makes night by intercepting the light
of the sun. In Augustin<a id="fnanchor12-4" href="#note12-4"><span
class="fnanchor">12</span></a> (who flourished <span class="sc">a.
d.</span> 400) the opinion is treated on other grounds; and without
denying the globular form of the earth, it is asserted that there are
no inhabitants on the opposite side, because no such race is recorded
by Scripture among the descendants of Adam.<a id="fnanchor13-4"
href="#note13-4"><span class="fnanchor">13</span></a> Considerations
of the same kind operated in the well-known instance of Virgil, Bishop
of Salzburg, in the eighth century. When he was reported to Boniface,
Archbishop of Mentz, as holding the existence of Antipodes, the
prelate was shocked at the assumption, as it seemed to him, of a world
of human beings, out of the reach of the conditions of salvation; and
application was made to Pope Zachary for a censure of the holder of
this dangerous doctrine. It does not, however, appear that this led to
any severity; and the story of the deposition of Virgil from his
bishopric, which is circulated by Kepler and by more modern writers,
is undoubtedly altogether false. The same scruples continued to
prevail among Christian writers to a later period; and Tostatus<a
id="fnanchor14-4" href="#note14-4"><span
class="fnanchor">14</span></a> notes the opinion of the rotundity of
the earth as an “unsafe” doctrine, only a few years before Columbus
visited the other hemisphere.</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note13-4"
href="#fnanchor13-4">13</a></span> It appears, however, that
scriptural arguments were found on the other side. St. Jerome says
(<i>Comm. in Ezech.</i> i. 6), speaking of the two cherubims with four
faces, seen by the prophet, and the interpretation of the vision:
“Alii vero qui philosophorum stultam sequuntur sapientiam, duo
hemispheria in duobus templi cherubim, nos et antipodes, quasi supinos
et cadentes homines suspicantur.”</div>

href="#fnanchor14-4">14</a></span> Montfauc. <i>Patr.</i> t. ii.</div>
<p>8. <i>Intellectual Condition of the Religious Orders.</i>&#8212;It
must be recollected, however, that though these were the views and
tenets of many religious writers, and though they may be taken as
indications of the prevalent and characteristic temper of the times of
which we speak, they never were universal. Such a confusion of thought
affects the minds of many persons, even in the most enlightened times;
and in what we call the Dark Ages, though clear views on such subjects
might be more rare, those who gave their minds to science, entertained
the true opinion of the figure of the earth. Thus Boëthius<a
id="fnanchor15-4" href="#note15-4"><span
class="fnanchor">15</span></a> (in the sixth century) urges the
smallness of the globe of the earth, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page198">198</a></span> compared with the heavens, as a reason
to repress our love of glory. This work, it will be recollected, was
translated into the Anglo-Saxon by our own Alfred. It was also
commented on by Bede, who, in what he says on this passage, assents to
the doctrine, and shows an acquaintance with Ptolemy and his
commentators, both Arabian and Greek. Gerbert, in the tenth century,
went from France to Spain to study astronomy with the Arabians, and
soon surpassed his masters. He is reported to have fabricated clocks,
and an astrolabe of peculiar construction. Gerbert afterwards (in the
last year of the first thousand from the birth of Christ) became pope,
by the name of Sylvester II. Among other cultivators of the sciences,
some of whom, from their proficiency, must have possessed with
considerable clearness and steadiness the elementary ideas on which it
depends, we may here mention, after Montucla,<a id="fnanchor16-4"
href="#note16-4"><span class="fnanchor">16</span></a> Adelbold, whose
work On the Sphere was addressed to Pope Sylvester, and whose
geometrical reasonings are, according to Montucla,<a id="fnanchor17-4"
href="#note17-4"><span class="fnanchor">17</span></a> vague and
chimerical; Hermann Contractus, a monk of St Gall, who, in 1050,
published astronomical works; William of Hirsaugen, who followed his
example in 1080; Robert of Lorraine, who was made Bishop of Hereford
by William the Conqueror, in consequence of his astronomical
knowledge. In the next century, Adelhard Goth, an Englishman,
travelled among the Arabs for purposes of study, as Gerbert had done
in the preceding age; and on his return, translated the Elements of
Euclid, which he had brought from Spain or Egypt. Robert Grostête,
Bishop of Lincoln, was the author of an Epitome on the Sphere; Roger
Bacon, in his youth the contemporary of Robert, and of his brother
Adam Marsh, praises very highly their knowledge in mathematics.</p>

<p>“And here,” says the French historian of mathematics, whom I have
followed in the preceding relation, “it is impossible not to reflect
that all those men who, if they did not augment the treasure of the
sciences, at least served to transmit it, were monks, or had been such
originally. Convents were, during these stormy ages, the asylum of
sciences and letters. Without these religious men, who, in the silence
of their monasteries, occupied themselves in transcribing, in
studying, and in imitating the works of the ancients, well or ill,
those works would have perished; perhaps not one of them would have
come down to us. The thread which connects us with the Greeks and
Romans would have been snapt asunder; the precious productions of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page199">199</a></span> ancient
literature would no more exist for us, than the works, if any there
were, published before the catastrophe that annihilated that highly
scientific nation, which, according to Bailly, existed in remote ages
in the centre of Tartary, or at the roots of Caucasus. In the sciences
we should have had all to create; and at the moment when the human
mind should have emerged from its stupor and shaken off its slumbers,
we should have been no more advanced than the Greeks were after the
taking of Troy.” He adds, that this consideration inspires feelings
towards the religious orders very different from those which, when he
wrote, were prevalent among his countrymen.</p>
<p>Except so far as their religious opinions interfered, it was
natural that men who lived a life of quiet and study, and were
necessarily in a great measure removed from the absorbing and blinding
interests with which practical life occupies the thoughts, should
cultivate science more successfully than others, precisely because
their ideas on speculative subjects had time and opportunity to become
clear and steady. The studies which were cultivated under the name of
the Seven Liberal Arts, necessarily tended to favor this effect. The
<i>Trivium</i>,<a id="fnanchor18-4" href="#note18-4"><span
class="fnanchor">18</span></a> indeed, which consisted of Grammar,
Logic, and Rhetoric, had no direct bearing upon those ideas with which
physical science is concerned; but the <i>Quadrivium</i>, Music,
Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy, could not be pursued with any
attention, without a corresponding improvement of the mind for the
purposes of sound knowledge.<a id="fnanchor19-4"

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note19-4"
href="#fnanchor19-4">19</a></span> Roger Bacon, in his <i>Specula
Mathematica</i>, cap. i., says “Harum scientiarum porta et clavis est
mathematica, quam sancti a principio mundi invenerunt, etc. Cujus
negligentia <em>jam per triginta vel quadraginta annos</em> destruxit
totum studium Latinorum.” I do not know on what occasion this neglect
took place.</div>
<p>9. <i>Popular Opinions.</i>&#8212;That, even in the best
intellects, something was wanting to fit them for scientific progress
and discovery, is obvious from the fact that science was so long
absolutely stationary. And I have endeavored to show that one part of
this deficiency was the want of the requisite clearness and vigor of
the fundamental scientific ideas. If these were wanting, even in the
most powerful and most cultivated minds, we may easily conceive that
still greater confusion and obscurity prevailed in the common class of
mankind. They actually adopted the belief, however crude and
inconsistent, that the form of the earth and heavens really is what at
any place it appears to be; that the earth is flat, and the waters of
the sky sustained above a material floor, through which in showers
they descend. Yet the true doctrines of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page200">200</a></span> astronomy appear to have had some
popular circulation. For instance, a French poem of the time of Edward
the Second, called <i>Ymage du Monde</i>, contains a metrical account
of the earth and heavens, according to the Ptolemaic views; and in a
manuscript of this poem, preserved in the library of the University of
Cambridge, there are representations, in accordance with the text, of
a spherical earth, with men standing upright upon it on every side;
and by way of illustrating the tendency of all things to the centre,
perforations of the earth, entirely through its mass, are described
and depicted; and figures are exhibited dropping balls down each of
these holes, so as to meet in the interior. And, as bearing upon the
perplexity which attends the motions of <i>up</i> and <i>down</i>,
when applied to the globular earth, and the change of the direction of
gravity which would occur in passing the centre, the readers of Dante
will recollect the extraordinary manner in which the poet and his
guide emerge from the bottom of the abyss; and the explanation which
Virgil imparts to him of what he there sees. After they have crept
through the aperture in which Lucifer is placed, the poet says,</p>

<p>The philosophical notions of up and down are too much at variance
with the obvious suggestions of our senses, to be held steadily and
justly by minds undisciplined in science. Perhaps it was some
misunderstood statement of the curved surface of the ocean, which gave
rise to the tradition of there being a part of the sea directly over
the earth, from which at times an object has been known to fall or an
anchor to be let down. Even such whimsical fancies are not without
instruction, and may serve to show the reader what that vagueness and
obscurity of ideas is, of which I have been endeavoring to trace the
prevalence in the dark ages.</p>
<p>We now proceed to another of the features which appears to me to
mark, in a very prominent manner, the character of the stationary
period.</p>
<hr class="three space-above" />
<h3>CHAPTER II.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">The Commentatorial Spirit of the Middle
Ages.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">WE</span> have already noticed, that,
after the first great achievements of the founders of sound
speculation, in the different departments of human knowledge, had
attracted the interest and admiration which those who became
acquainted with them could not but give to them, there appeared a
disposition among men to lean on the authority of some of these
teachers;&#8212;to study the opinions of others as the only mode of
forming their own;&#8212;to read nature through books;&#8212;to attend
to what had been already thought and said, rather than to what really
is and happens. This tendency of men’s minds requires our particular
consideration. Its manifestations were very important, and highly
characteristic of the stationary period; it gave, in a great degree, a
peculiar bias and direction to the intellectual activity of many
centuries; and the kind of labor with which speculative men were
occupied in consequence of this bias, took the place of that
examination of realities which must be their employment, in order that
real knowledge may make any decided progress.</p>
<p>In some subjects, indeed, as, for instance, in the domains of
morals, poetry, and the arts, whose aim is the production of beauty,
this opposition between the study of former opinion and present
reality, may not be so distinct; inasmuch as it may be said by some,
that, in these subjects, opinions are realities; that the thoughts and
feelings which <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page202">202</a></span>
prevail in men’s minds are the material upon which we must work, the
particulars from which we are to generalize, the instruments which we
are to use; and that, therefore, to reject the study of antiquity, or
even its authority, would be to show ourselves ignorant of the extent
and mutual bearing of the elements with which we have to
deal;&#8212;would be to cut asunder that which we ought to unite into
a vital whole. Yet even in the provinces of history and poetry, the
poverty and servility of men’s minds during the middle ages, are shown
by indications so strong as to be truly remarkable; for instance, in
the efforts of the antiquarians of almost every European country to
assimilate the early history of their own state to the poet’s account
of the foundation of Rome, by bringing from the sack of Troy, Brutus
to England, Bavo to Flanders, and so on. But however this may be, our
business at present is, to trace the varying spirit of the
<em>physical</em> philosophy of different ages; trusting that,
hereafter, this prefatory study will enable us to throw some light
upon the other parts of philosophy. And in physics the case
undoubtedly was, that the labor of observation, which is one of the
two great elements of the progress of knowledge, was in a great
measure superseded by the collection, the analysis, the explanation,
of previous authors and opinions; experimenters were replaced by
commentators; criticism took the place of induction; and instead of
great discoverers we had learned men.</p>
<p>1. <i>Natural Bias to Authority.</i>&#8212;It is very evident that,
in such a bias of men’s studies, there is something very natural;
however strained and technical this erudition may have been, the
propensities on which it depends are very general, and are easily
seen. Deference to the authority of thoughtful and sagacious men, a
disposition which men in general neither reject nor think they ought
to reject in practical matters, naturally clings to them, even in
speculation. It is a satisfaction to us to suppose that there are, or
have been, minds of transcendent powers, of wide and wise views,
superior to the common errors and blindness of our nature. The
pleasure of admiration, and the repose of confidence, are inducements
to such a belief. There are also other reasons why we willingly
believe that there are in philosophy great teachers, so profound and
sagacious, that, in order to arrive at truth, we have only to learn
their thoughts, to understand their writings. There is a peculiar
interest which men feel in dealing with the thoughts of their
fellow-men, rather than with brute matter. Matter feels and excites no
sympathies: in seeking for mere laws of nature, there is nothing of
mental intercourse with the great spirits of the past, as there is in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page203">203</a></span> studying
Aristotle or Plato. Moreover, a large portion of this employment is of
a kind the most agreeable to most speculative minds; it consists in
tracing the consequences of assumed principles: it is deductive like
geometry: and the principles of the teachers being known, and being
undisputed, the deduction and application of their results is an
obvious, self-satisfying, and inexhaustible exercise of ingenuity.</p>
<p>These causes, and probably others, make criticism and commentation
flourish, when invention begins to fail, oppressed and bewildered by
the acquisitions it has already made; and when the vigor and hope of
men’s minds are enfeebled by civil and political changes.
Accordingly,<a id="fnanchor20-4" href="#note20-4"><span
class="fnanchor">20</span></a> the Alexandrian school was eminently
characterized by a spirit of erudition, of literary criticism, of
interpretation, of imitation. These practices, which reigned first in
their full vigor in “the Museum,” are likely to be, at all times, the
leading propensities of similar academical institutions.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note20-4"
href="#fnanchor20-4">20</a></span> Degerando, <i>Hist. des Syst. de
Philos.</i> iii. p. 134.</div>
<p>How natural it is to select a great writer as a paramount
authority, and to ascribe to him extraordinary profundity and
sagacity, we may see, in the manner in which the Greeks looked upon
Homer; and the fancy which detected in his poems traces of the origin
of all arts and sciences, has, as we know, found favor even in modern
times. To pass over earlier instances of this feeling, we may observe,
that Strabo begins his Geography by saying that he agrees with
Hipparchus, who had declared Homer to be the first author of our
geographical knowledge; and he does not confine the application of
this assertion to the various and curious topographical information
which the Iliad and Odyssey contain, concerning the countries
surrounding the Mediterranean; but in phrases which, to most persons,
might appear the mere play of a poetical fancy, or a casual selection
of circumstances, he finds unquestionable evidence of a correct
knowledge of general geographical truths. Thus,<a id="fnanchor21-4"
href="#note21-4"><span class="fnanchor">21</span></a> when Homer
speaks of the sun “rising from the soft and deep-flowing ocean,” of
his “splendid blaze plunging in the ocean;” of the northern
constellation</p>
<p class="center medium">“Alone unwashen by the ocean wave;”</p>
<p class="noind">and of Jupiter, “who goes to the ocean to feast with
the blameless Ethiopians;” Strabo is satisfied from these passages
that Homer knew the dry land to be surrounded with water: and he
reasons in like manner with respect to other points of geography.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note21-4"
href="#fnanchor21-4">21</a></span> Strabo, i. p. 5.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page204">204</a></span> 2.
<i>Character of Commentators.</i>&#8212;The spirit of commentation, as
has already been suggested, turns to questions of taste, of
metaphysics, of morals, with far more avidity than to physics.
Accordingly, critics and grammarians were peculiarly the growth of
this school; and, though the commentators sometimes chose works of
mathematical or physical science for their subject (as Proclus, who
commented on Euclid’s Geometry, and Simplicius, on Aristotle’s
Physics), these commentaries were, in fact, rather metaphysical than
mathematical. It does not appear that the commentators have, in any
instance, illustrated the author by bringing his assertions of facts
to the test of experiment. Thus, when Simplicius comments on the
passage concerning a vacuum, which we <a href="#v1page67">formerly</a>
adduced, he notices the argument which went upon the assertion, that a
vessel full of ashes would contain as much water as an empty vessel;
and he mentions various opinions of different authors, but no trial of
the fact. Eudemus had said, that the ashes contained something hot, as
quicklime does, and that by means of this, a part of the water was
evaporated; others supposed the water to be condensed, and so on.<a
id="fnanchor22-4" href="#note22-4"><span
class="fnanchor">22</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note22-4"
href="#fnanchor22-4">22</a></span> Simplicius, p. 170.</div>
<p>The Commentator’s professed object is to explain, to enforce, to
illustrate doctrines assumed as true. He endeavors to adapt the work
on which he employs himself to the state of information and of opinion
in his own time; to elucidate obscurities and technicalities; to
supply steps omitted in the reasoning; but he does not seek to obtain
additional truths or new generalizations. He undertakes only to give
what is virtually contained in his author; to develop, but not to
create. He is a cultivator of the thoughts of others: his labor is not
spent on a field of his own; he ploughs but to enrich the granary of
another man. Thus he does not work as a freeman, but as one in a
servile condition; or rather, his is a menial, and not a productive
service: his office is to adorn the appearance of his master, not to
increase his wealth.</p>
<p>Yet though the Commentator’s employment is thus subordinate and
dependent, he is easily led to attribute to it the greatest importance
and dignity. To elucidate good books is, indeed, a useful task; and
when those who undertake this work execute it well, it would be most
unreasonable to find fault with them for not doing more. But the
critic, long and earnestly employed on one author, may easily
underrate the relative value of other kinds of mental exertion. He may
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page205">205</a></span> ascribe too
large dimensions to that which occupies the whole of his own field of
vision. Thus he may come to consider such study as the highest aim,
and best evidence of human genius. To understand Aristotle, or Plato,
may appear to him to comprise all that is possible of profundity and
acuteness. And when he has travelled over a portion of their domain,
and satisfied himself that of this he too is master, he may look with
complacency at the circuit he has made, and speak of it as a labor of
vast effort and difficulty. We may quote, as an expression of this
temper, the language of Sir Henry Savile, in concluding a course of
lectures on Euclid, delivered at Oxford.<a id="fnanchor23-4"
href="#note23-4"><span class="fnanchor">23</span></a> “By the grace of
God, gentlemen hearers, I have performed my promise; I have redeemed
my pledge. I have explained, according to my ability, the definitions,
postulates, axioms, and <em>first eight propositions</em> of the
Elements of Euclid. Here, sinking under the weight of years, I lay
down my art and my instruments.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note23-4"
href="#fnanchor23-4">23</a></span> Exolvi per Dei gratiam, Domini
auditores, promissum; liberavi fldem meam; explicavi pro meo modulo,
definitiones, petitiones, communes sententias, et <em>octo priores
propositiones</em> Elementorum Euclidis. Hic, annis fessus, cyclos
artemque repono.</div>
<p>We here speak of the peculiar province of the Commentator; for
undoubtedly, in many instances, a commentary on a received author has
been made the vehicle of conveying systems and doctrines entirely
different from those of the author himself; as, for instance, when the
New Platonists wrote, taking Plato for their text. The labors of
learned men in the stationary period, which came under this
description, belong to another class.</p>
<p>3. <i>Greek Commentators on Aristotle.</i>&#8212;The commentators
or disciples of the great philosophers did not assume at once their
servile character. At first their object was to supply and correct, as
well as to explain their teacher. Thus among the earlier commentators
of Aristotle, Theophrastus invented five moods of syllogism in the
first figure, in addition to the four invented by Aristotle, and
stated with additional accuracy the rules of hypothetical syllogisms.
He also not only collected much information concerning animals, and
natural events, which Aristotle had omitted, but often differed with
his master; as, for instance, concerning the saltness of the sea:
this, which the Stagirite attributed to the effect of the evaporation
produced by the sun’s rays, was ascribed by Theophrastus to beds of
salt at the bottom. Porphyry,<a id="fnanchor24-4"
href="#note24-4"><span class="fnanchor">24</span></a> who flourished
in the third century, wrote a book on the <i>Predicables</i>, which
was found to be so suitable a complement <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page206">206</a></span> to the <i>Predicaments</i> or Categories
of Aristotle, that it was usually prefixed to that treatise; and the
two have been used as an elementary work together, up to modern times.
The Predicables are the five steps which the gradations of generality
and particularity introduce;&#8212;<i>genus</i>, <i>species</i>,
<i>difference</i>, <i>individual</i>, <i>accident</i>:&#8212;the
Categories are the ten heads under which assertions or predications
may be arranged:&#8212;<i>substance</i>, <i>quantity</i>,
<i>relation</i>, <i>quality</i>, <i>place</i>, <i>time</i>,
<i>position</i>, <i>habit</i>, <i>action</i>, <i>passion</i>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note24-4"
href="#fnanchor24-4">24</a></span> Buhle, Arist. i. 284.</div>
<p>At a later period, the Aristotelian commentators became more
servile, and followed the author step by step, explaining, according
to their views, his expressions and doctrines; often, indeed, with
extreme prolixity, expanding his clauses into sentences, and his
sentences into paragraphs. Alexander Aphrodisiensis, who lived at the
end of the second century, is of this class; “sometimes useful,” as
one of the recent editors of Aristotle says;<a id="fnanchor25-4"
href="#note25-4"><span class="fnanchor">25</span></a> “but by the
prolixity of his interpretation, by his perverse itch for himself
discussing the argument expounded by Aristotle, for defending his
opinions, and for refuting or reconciling those of others, he rather
obscures than enlightens.” At various times, also, some of the
commentators, and especially those of the Alexandrian school,
endeavored to reconcile, or combined without reconciling, opposing
doctrines of the great philosophers of the earlier times. Simplicius,
for instance, and, indeed, a great number of the Alexandrian
Philosophers,<a id="fnanchor26-4" href="#note26-4"><span
class="fnanchor">26</span></a> as Alexander, Ammonius, and others,
employed themselves in the futile task of reconciling the doctrines of
the Pythagoreans, of the Eleatics, of Plato, and of the Stoics, with
those of Aristotle. Boethius<a id="fnanchor27-4"
href="#note27-4"><span class="fnanchor">27</span></a> entertained the
design of translating into Latin the whole of Aristotle’s and Plato’s
works, and of showing their agreement; a gigantic plan, which he never
executed. Others employed themselves in disentangling the confusion
which such attempts produced, as John the Grammarian, surnamed
Philoponus, “the Labor-loving;” who, towards the end of the seventh
century, maintained that Aristotle was entirely misunderstood by
Porphyry and Proclus,<a id="fnanchor28-4" href="#note28-4"><span
class="fnanchor">28</span></a> who had pretended to incorporate his
doctrines into those of the New Platonic school, or even to reconcile
him with Plato himself on the subject of <em>ideas</em>. Others,
again, wrote Epitomes, Compounds, Abstracts; and endeavored to throw
the works of the philosopher into some simpler and more obviously
regular form, as John of Damascus, in <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page207">207</a></span> the middle of the eighth century, who
made abstracts of some of Aristotle’s works, and introduced the study
of the author into theological education. These two writers lived
under the patronage of the Arabs; the former was favored by Amrou, the
conqueror of Egypt; the latter was at first secretary to the Caliph,
but afterwards withdrew to a monastery.<a id="fnanchor29-4"

<p>At this period the Arabians became the fosterers and patrons of
philosophy, rather than the Greeks. Justinian had, by an edict, closed
the school of Athens, the last of the schools of heathen philosophy.
Leo, the Isaurian, who was a zealous Iconoclast, abolished also the
schools where general knowledge had been taught, in combination with
Christianity,<a id="fnanchor30-4" href="#note30-4"><span
class="fnanchor">30</span></a> yet the line of the Aristotelian
commentators was continued, though feebly, to the later ages of the
Greek empire. Anna Comnena<a id="fnanchor31-4" href="#note31-4"><span
class="fnanchor">31</span></a> mentions a Eustratus who employed
himself upon the dialectic and moral treatises, and whom she does not
hesitate to elevate above the Stoics and Platonists, for his talent in
philosophical discussions. Nicephorus Blemmydes wrote logical and
physical epitomes for the use of John Ducas; George Pachymerus
composed an epitome of the philosophy of Aristotle, and a compend of
his logic; Theodore Metochytes, who was famous in his time alike for
his eloquence and his learning, has left a paraphrase of the books of
Aristotle on Physics, on the Soul, the Heavens,<a id="fnanchor32-4"
href="#note32-4"><span class="fnanchor">32</span></a> &amp;c.
Fabricius states that this writer has a chapter, the object of which
is to prove, that all philosophers, and Aristotle and Plato in
particular, have disdained the authority of their predecessors. He
could hardly help remarking in how different a spirit philosophy had
been pursued since their time.</p>

<p>4. <i>Greek Commentators of Plato and others.</i>&#8212;I have
spoken principally of the commentators of Aristotle, for he was the
great subject of the commentators proper; and though the name of his
rival, Plato, was graced by a list of attendants, hardly less
numerous, these, the Neoplatonists, as they are called, had introduced
new elements into the doctrines of their nominal master, to such an
extent that they must be placed in a different class. We may observe
here, however, how, in this school as in the Peripatetic, the race of
commentators multiplied itself. Porphyry, who commented on Aristotle,
was commented on by Ammonius; Plotinus’s Enneads were commented on by
Proclus and Dexippus. Psellus<a id="fnanchor33-4"
href="#note33-4"><span class="fnanchor">33</span></a> the elder was a
paraphrast of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page208">208</a></span>
Aristotle; Psellus the younger, in the eleventh century, attempted to
restore the New Platonic school. The former of these two writers had
for his pupils two men, the emperor Leo, surnamed the Philosopher, and
Photius the patriarch, who exerted themselves to restore the study of
literature at Constantinople. We still possess the Collection of
Extracts of Photius, which, like that of Stobæus and others, shows the
tendency of the age to compilations, abstracts, and
epitomes,&#8212;the extinction of philosophical vitality.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note33-4"
href="#fnanchor33-4">33</a></span> Deg. iv. 169.</div>
<p>5. <i>Arabian Commentators of Aristotle.</i>&#8212;The reader might
perhaps have expected, that when the philosophy of the Greeks was
carried among a new race of intellects, of a different national
character and condition, the train of this servile tradition would
have been broken; that some new thoughts would have started forth;
that some new direction, some new impulse, would have been given to
the search for truth. It might have been anticipated that we should
have had schools among the Arabians which should rival the
Peripatetic, Academic, and Stoic among the Greeks;&#8212;that they
would preoccupy the ground on which Copernicus and Galileo, Lavoisier
and Linnæus, won their fame;&#8212;that they would make the next great
steps in the progressive sciences. Nothing of this, however, happened.
The Arabians cannot claim, in science or philosophy, any really great
names; they produced no men and no discoveries which have materially
influenced the course and destinies of human knowledge; they tamely
adopted the intellectual servitude of the nation which they conquered
by their arms; they joined themselves at once to the string of slaves
who were dragging the car of Aristotle and Plotinus. Nor, perhaps, on
a little further reflection, shall we be surprised at this want of
vigor and productive power, in this period of apparent national youth.
The Arabians had not been duly prepared rightly to enjoy and use the
treasures of which they became possessed. They had, like most
uncivilized nations, been passionately fond of their indigenous
poetry; their imagination had been awakened, but their rational powers
and speculative tendencies were still torpid. They received the Greek
philosophy without having passed through those gradations of ardent
curiosity and keen research, of obscurity brightening into clearness,
of doubt succeeded by the joy of discovery, by which the Greek mind
had been enlarged and exercised. Nor had the Arabians ever enjoyed, as
the Greeks had, the individual consciousness, the independent
volition, the intellectual freedom, arising from the freedom of
political institutions. They had not felt the contagious mental
activity of a small city,&#8212;the elation arising from the general
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page209">209</a></span> sympathy in
speculative pursuits diffused through an intelligent and acute
audience; in short, they had not had a national education such as
fitted the Greeks to be disciples of Plato and Hipparchus. Hence,
their new literary wealth rather encumbered and enslaved, than
enriched and strengthened them: in their want of taste for
intellectual freedom, they were glad to give themselves up to the
guidance of Aristotle and other dogmatists. Their military habits had
accustomed them to look to a leader; their reverence for the book of
their law had prepared them to accept a philosophical Koran also. Thus
the Arabians, though they never translated the Greek poetry,
translated, and merely translated, the Greek philosophy; they followed
the Greek philosophers without deviation, or, at least, without any
philosophical deviations. They became for the most part
Aristotelians;&#8212;studied not only Aristotle, but the commentators
of Aristotle; and themselves swelled the vast and unprofitable
herd.</p>
<p>The philosophical works of Aristotle had, in some measure, made
their way in the East, before the growth of the Saracen power. In the
sixth century, a Syrian, Uranus,<a id="fnanchor34-4"
href="#note34-4"><span class="fnanchor">34</span></a> encouraged by
the love of philosophy manifested by Cosroes, had translated some of
the writings of the Stagirite; about the same time, Sergius had given
some translations in Syriac. In the seventh century, Jacob of Edessa
translated into this language the Dialectics, and added Notes to the
work. Such labors became numerous; and the first Arabic translations
of Aristotle were formed upon these Persian or Syriac texts. In this
succession of transfusions, some mistakes must inevitably have been
introduced.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note34-4"
href="#fnanchor34-4">34</a></span> Deg. iv. 196.</div>
<p>The Arabian interpreters of Aristotle, like a large portion of the
Alexandrian ones, gave to the philosopher a tinge of opinions borrowed
from another source, of which I shall have to speak under the head of
<i>Mysticism</i>. But they are, for the most part, sufficiently strong
examples of the peculiar spirit of commentation, to make it fitting to
notice them here. At the head of them stands<a id="fnanchor35-4"
href="#note35-4"><span class="fnanchor">35</span></a> Alkindi, who
appears to have lived at the court of Almamon, and who wrote
commentaries on the Organon of Aristotle. But Alfarabi was the glory
of the school of Bagdad; his knowledge included mathematics,
astronomy, medicine, and philosophy. Born in an elevated rank, and
possessed of a rich patrimony, he led an austere life, and devoted
himself altogether to study and meditation. He employed himself
particularly in unfolding the import of Aristotle’s treatise On the
Soul.<a id="fnanchor36-4" href="#note36-4"><span
class="fnanchor">36</span></a> Avicenna (Ebn Sina) <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page210">210</a></span> was at once the
Hippocrates and the Aristotle of the Arabians; and certainly the most
extraordinary man that the nation produced. In the course of an
unfortunate and stormy life, occupied by politics and by pleasures, he
produced works which were long revered as a sort of code of science.
In particular, his writings on medicine, though they contain little
besides a compilation of Hippocrates and Galen, took the place of
both, even in the universities of Europe; and were studied as models
at Paris and Montpelier, till the end of the seventeenth century, at
which period they fell into an almost complete oblivion. Avicenna is
conceived, by some modern writers,<a id="fnanchor37-4"
href="#note37-4"><span class="fnanchor">37</span></a> to have shown
some power of original thinking in his representations of the
Aristotelian Logic and Metaphysics. Averroes (Ebn Roshd) of Cordova,
was the most illustrious of the Spanish Aristotelians, and became the
guide of the schoolmen,<a id="fnanchor38-4" href="#note38-4"><span
class="fnanchor">38</span></a> being placed by them on a level with
Aristotle himself, or above him. He translated Aristotle from the
first Syriac version, not being able to read the Greek text. He
aspired to, and retained for centuries, the title of the
<i>Commentator</i>; and he deserves this title by the servility with
which he maintains that Aristotle<a id="fnanchor39-4"
href="#note39-4"><span class="fnanchor">39</span></a> carried the
sciences to the highest possible degree, measured their whole extent,
and fixed their ultimate and permanent boundaries; although his works
are conceived to exhibit a trace of the New Platonism. Some of his
writings are directed against an Arabian skeptic, of the name of
Algazel, whom we have <a href="#v1page194">already</a> noticed.</p>

<p>When the schoolmen had adopted the supremacy of Aristotle to the
extent in which Averroes maintained it, their philosophy went further
than a system of mere commentation, and became a system of dogmatism;
we must, therefore, in another <a href="#v1page228">chapter</a>, say a
few words more of the Aristotelians in this point of view, before we
proceed to the revival of science; but we must previously consider
some other features in the character of the Stationary Period. <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page211">211</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER III.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Of the Mysticism of the Middle Ages.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IT</span> has been already several
times hinted, that a new and peculiar element was introduced into the
Greek philosophy which occupied the attention of the Alexandrian
school; and that this element tinged a large portion of the
speculations of succeeding ages. We may speak of this peculiar element
as <i>Mysticism</i>; for, from the notion usually conveyed by this
term, the reader will easily apprehend the general character of the
tendency now spoken of; and especially when he sees its effect pointed
out in various subjects. Thus, instead of referring the events of the
external world to space and time, to sensible connection and
causation, men attempted to reduce such occurrences under spiritual
and supersensual relations and dependencies; they referred them to
superior intelligences, to theological conditions, to past and future
events in the moral world, to states of mind and feelings, to the
creatures of an imaginary mythology or demonology. And thus their
physical Science became Magic, their Astronomy became Astrology, the
study of the Composition of bodies became Alchemy, Mathematics became
the contemplation of the Spiritual Relations of number and figure, and
Philosophy became Theosophy.</p>
<p>The examination of this feature in the history of the human mind is
important for us, in consequence of its influence upon the employments
and the thoughts of the times now under our notice. This tendency
materially affected both men’s speculations and their labours in the
pursuit of knowledge. By its direct operation, it gave rise to the
newer Platonic philosophy among the Greeks, and to corresponding
doctrines among the Arabians; and by calling into a prominent place
astrology, alchemy, and magic, it long occupied most of the real
observers of the material world. In this manner it delayed and impeded
the progress of true science; for we shall see reason to believe that
human knowledge lost more by the perversion of men’s minds and the
misdirection of their efforts, than it gained by any increase of zeal
arising from the peculiar hopes and objects of the mystics.</p>
<p>It is not our purpose to attempt any general view of the progress
and fortunes of the various forms of Mystical Philosophy; but only to
exhibit some of its characters, in so far as they illustrate those
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page212">212</a></span> tendencies of
thought which accompanied the retrogradation of inductive science. And
of these, the leading feature which demands our notice is that already
alluded to; namely, the practice of referring things and events, not
to clear and distinct relations, obviously applicable to such
cases;&#8212;not to general rules capable of direct verification; but
to notions vague, distant, and vast, which we cannot bring into
contact with facts, because they belong to a different region from the
facts; as when we connect natural events with moral or historical
causes, or seek spiritual meanings in the properties of number and
figure. Thus the character of Mysticism is, that it refers
particulars, not to generalizations homogeneous and immediate, but to
such as are heterogeneous and remote; to which we must add, that the
process of this reference is not a calm act of the intellect, but is
accompanied with a glow of enthusiastic feeling.</p>
<p>1. <i>Neoplatonic Theosophy.</i>&#8212;The <i>Newer Platonism</i>
is the first example of this Mystical Philosophy which I shall
consider. The main points which here require our notice are, the
doctrine of an Intellectual World resulting from the act of the Divine
Mind, as the only reality; and the aspiration after the union of the
human soul with this Divine Mind, as the object of human existence.
The “Ideas” of Plato were Forms of our knowledge; but among the
Neoplatonists they became really existing, indeed the only really
existing, Objects; and the inaccessible scheme of the universe which
these ideas constitute, was offered as the great subject of
philosophical contemplation. The desire of the human mind to approach
towards its Creator and Preserver, and to obtain a spiritual access to
Him, leads to an employment of the thoughts which is well worth the
notice of the religious philosopher; but such an effort, even when
founded on revelation and well regulated, is not a means of advance in
physics; and when it is the mere result of natural enthusiasm, it may
easily obtain such a place in men’s minds as to unfit them for the
successful prosecution of natural philosophy. The temper, therefore,
which introduces such supernatural communion into the general course
of its speculations, may be properly treated as mystical, and as one
of the causes of the decline of science in the Stationary Period. The
Neoplatonic philosophy requires our notice as one of the most
remarkable forms of this Mysticism.</p>
<p>Though Ammonius Saccas, who flourished at the end of the second
century, is looked upon as the beginner of the Neoplatonists, his
disciple Plotinus is, in reality, the great founder of the school,
both by his <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page213">213</a></span>
works, which still remain to us, and by the enthusiasm which his
character and manners inspired among his followers. He lived a life of
meditation, gentleness, and self-denial, and died in the second year
of the reign of Claudius (<span class="sc">a. d.</span> 270). His
disciple, Porphyry, has given us a Life of him, from which we may see
how well his habitual manners were suited to make his doctrines
impressive. “Plotinus, the philosopher of our time,” Porphyry thus
begins his biography, “appeared like a person ashamed that he was in
the body. In consequence of this disposition, he could not bear to
talk concerning his family, or his parents, or his country. He would
not allow himself to be represented by a painter or statuary; and
once, when Aurelius entreated him to permit a likeness of him to be
taken, he said, ‘Is it not enough for us to carry this image in which
nature has enclosed us, but we must also try to leave a more durable
image of this image, as if it were so great a sight?’ And he retained
the same temper to the last. When he was dying, he said, ‘I am trying
to bring the divinity which is in us to the divinity which is in the
universe.’” He was looked upon by his successors with extraordinary
admiration and reverence; and his disciple Porphyry collected from his
lips, or from fragmental notes, the six <i>Enneads</i> of his
doctrines (that is, parts each consisting of <i>nine</i> Books), which
he arranged and annotated.</p>
<p>We have no difficulty in finding in this remarkable work examples
of mystical speculation. The Intelligible World of realities or
essences corresponds to the world of sense<a id="fnanchor40-4"
href="#note40-4"><span class="fnanchor">40</span></a> in the classes
of things which it includes. To the Intelligible World, man’s mind
ascends, by a triple road which Plotinus figuratively calls that of
the Musician, the Lover, the Philosopher.<a id="fnanchor41-4"
href="#note41-4"><span class="fnanchor">41</span></a> The activity of
the human soul is identified by analogy with the motion of the
heavens. “This activity is about a middle point, and thus it is
circular; but a middle point is not the same in body and in the soul:
in that, the middle point is local; in this, it is that on which the
rest depends. There is, however, an analogy; for as in one case, so in
the other, there must be a middle point, and as the sphere revolves
about its centre, the soul revolves about God through its
affections.”</p>

<p>The conclusion of the work is,<a id="fnanchor42-4"
href="#note42-4"><span class="fnanchor">42</span></a> as might be
supposed, upon the approach to, union with, and fruition of God. The
author refers again to the analogy between the movements of the soul
and those of the heavens. “We move round him like a choral dance; even
when we <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page214">214</a></span> look
from him we revolve about him: we do not always look at him, but when
we do, we have satisfaction and rest, and the harmony which belongs to
that divine movement. In this movement, the mind beholds the fountain
of life, the fountain of mind, the origin of being, the cause of good,
the root of the soul.”<a id="fnanchor43-4" href="#note43-4"><span
class="fnanchor">43</span></a> “There will be a time when this vision
shall be continual; the mind being no more interrupted, nor suffering
any perturbation from the body. Yet that which beholds is not that
which is disturbed; and when this vision becomes dim, it does not
obscure the knowledge which resides in demonstration, and faith, and
reasoning; but the vision itself is not reason, but greater than
reason, and before reason.”<a id="fnanchor44-4" href="#note44-4"><span

<p>The fifth book of the third Ennead has for its subject the Dæmon
which belongs to each man. It is entitled “Concerning Love;” and the
doctrine appears to be, that the Love, or common source of the
passions which is in each man’s mind, is “the Dæmon which they say
accompanies each man.”<a id="fnanchor45-4" href="#note45-4"><span
class="fnanchor">45</span></a> These dæmons were, however (at least by
later writers), invested with a visible aspect and with a personal
character, including a resemblance of human passions and motives. It
is curious thus to see an untenable and visionary generalization
falling back into the domain of the senses and the fancy, after a vain
attempt to support itself in the region of the reason. This
imagination soon produced pretensions to the power of making these
dæmons or genii visible; and the Treatise on the Mysteries of the
Egyptians, which is attributed to Iamblichus, gives an account of the
secret ceremonies, the mysterious words, the sacrifices and
expiations, by which this was to be done.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary for us to dwell on the progress of this school;
to point out the growth of the Theurgy which thus arose; or to
describe the attempts to claim a high antiquity for this system, and
to make Orpheus, the poet, the first promulgator of its doctrines. The
system, like all mystical systems, assumed the character rather of
religion than of a theory. The opinions of its disciples materially
influenced their lives. It gave the world the spectacle of an austere
morality, a devotional exaltation, combined with the grossest
superstitions of Paganism. The successors of Iamblichus appeared
rather to hold a priesthood, than the chair of a philosophical
school.<a id="fnanchor46-4" href="#note46-4"><span
class="fnanchor">46</span></a> They were persecuted by Constantine and
Constantius, as opponents of Christianity. Sopater, a <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page215">215</a></span> Syrian philosopher of
this school, was beheaded by the former emperor on a charge that he
had bound the winds by the power of magic.<a id="fnanchor47-4"
href="#note47-4"><span class="fnanchor">47</span></a> But Julian, who
shortly after succeeded to the purple, embraced with ardor the
opinions of Iamblichus. Proclus (who died <span class="sc">a.
d.</span> 487) was one of the greatest of the teachers of this
school;<a id="fnanchor48-4" href="#note48-4"><span
class="fnanchor">48</span></a> and was, both in his life and
doctrines, a worthy successor of Plotinus, Porphyry, and Iamblichus.
We possess a biography, or rather a panegyric of him, by his disciple
Marinus, in which he is exhibited as a representation of the ideal
perfection of the philosophic character, according to the views of the
Neoplatonists. His virtues are arranged as physical, moral,
purificatory, theoretic, and theurgic. Even in his boyhood, Apollo and
Minerva visited him in his dreams: he studied oratory at Alexandria,
but it was at Athens that Plutarch and Lysianus initiated him in the
mysteries of the New Platonists. He received a kind of consecration at
the hands of the daughter of Plutarch, the celebrated Asclepigenia,
who introduced him to the traditions of the Chaldeans, and the
practices of theurgy; he was also admitted to the mysteries of
Eleusis. He became celebrated for his knowledge and eloquence; but
especially for his skill in the supernatural arts which were connected
with the doctrines of his sect. He appears before us rather as a
hierophant than a philosopher. A large portion of his life was spent
in evocations, purifications, fastings, prayers, hymns, intercourse
with apparitions, and with the gods, and in the celebration of the
festivals of Paganism, especially those which were held in honor of
the Mother of the Gods. His religious admiration extended to all forms
of mythology. The philosopher, said he, is not the priest of a single
religion, but of all the religions of the world. Accordingly, he
composed hymns in honor of all the divinities of Greece, Rome, Egypt,
Arabia;&#8212;Christianity alone was excluded from his favor.</p>

<p>The reader will find an interesting view of the <i>School of
Alexandria</i>, in M. Barthelemy Saint-Hilaire’s <i>Rapport</i> on the
<i>Mémoires</i> sent to the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences at
Paris, in consequence of its having, in 1841, proposed this as the
subject of a prize, which was awarded in 1844. M. Saint-Hilaire has
prefixed to this <i>Rapport</i> a dissertation on the Mysticism of
that school. He, however, uses the term <i>Mysticism</i> in a wider
sense than my purpose, which regarded mainly the bearing of the
doctrines of this school upon the progress of the Inductive Sciences,
has led me to do. Although he finds much to <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page216">216</a></span> admire in the Alexandrian philosophy, he
declares that they were incapable of treating scientific questions.
The extent to which this is true is well illustrated by the extract
which he gives from Plotinus, on the question, “Why objects appear
smaller in proportion as they are more distant.” Plotinus denies that
the reason of this is that the angles of vision become smaller. His
reason for this denial is curious enough. If it were so, he says, how
could the heaven appear smaller than it is, since it occupies the
whole of the visual angle?</p>
<p>2. <i>Mystical Arithmetic.</i>&#8212;It is unnecessary further to
exemplify, from Proclus, the general mystical character of the school
and time to which he belonged; but we may notice more specially one of
the forms of this mysticism, which very frequently offers itself to
our notice, especially in him; and which we may call <i>Mystical
Arithmetic</i>. Like all the kinds of Mysticism, this consists in the
attempt to connect our conceptions of external objects by general and
inappropriate notions of goodness, perfection, and relation to the
divine essence and government; instead of referring such conceptions
to those appropriate ideas, which, by due attention, become perfectly
distinct, and capable of being positively applied and verified. The
subject which is thus dealt with, in the doctrines of which we now
speak, is Number; a notion which tempts men into these visionary
speculations more naturally than any other. For number is really
applicable to moral notions&#8212;to emotions and feelings, and to
their objects&#8212;as well as to the things of the material world.
Moreover, by the discovery of the principle of musical concords, it
had been found, probably most unexpectedly, that numerical relations
were closely connected with sounds which could hardly be distinguished
from the expression of thought and feeling; and a suspicion might
easily arise, that the universe, both of matter and of thought, might
contain many general and abstract truths of some analogous kind. The
relations of number have so wide a bearing, that the ramifications of
such a suspicion could not easily be exhausted, supposing men willing
to follow them into darkness and vagueness; which it is precisely the
mystical tendency to do. Accordingly, this kind of speculation
appeared very early, and showed itself first among the Pythagoreans,
as we might have expected, from the attention which they gave to the
theory of harmony: and this, as well as some other of the doctrines of
the Pythagorean philosophy, was adopted by the later Platonists, and,
indeed, by Plato himself, whose speculations concerning number have
decidedly a mystical character. The mere mathematical relations of
numbers,&#8212;as odd and even, perfect and imperfect, <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page217">217</a></span> abundant and
defective,&#8212;were, by a willing submission to an enthusiastic
bias, connected with the notions of good and beauty, which were
suggested by the terms expressing their relations; and principles
resulting from such a connection were woven into a wide and complex
system. It is not necessary to dwell long on this subject; the mere
titles of the works which treated of it show its nature. Archytas<a
id="fnanchor49-4" href="#note49-4"><span
class="fnanchor">49</span></a> is said to have written a treatise on
the number <i>ten</i>: Telaugé, the daughter of Pythagoras, wrote on
the number <i>four</i>. This number, indeed, which was known by the
name of the <i>Tetractys</i>, was very celebrated in the school of
Pythagoras. It is mentioned in the “Golden Verses,” which are ascribed
to him: the pupil is conjured to be virtuous,</p>

<p>In Plato’s works, we have evidence of a similar belief in religious
relations of Number; and in the new Platonists, this doctrine was
established as a system. Proclus, of whom we have been speaking,
founds his philosophy, in a great measure, on the relation of Unity
and Multiple; from this, he is led to represent the causality of the
Divine Mind by three Triads of abstractions; and in the development of
one part of this system, the number seven is introduced.<a
id="fnanchor50-4" href="#note50-4"><span
class="fnanchor">50</span></a> “The intelligible and intellectual gods
produce all things triadically; for the monads in these latter are
divided according to number; and what the monad was in the former, the
number is in these latter. And the intellectual gods produce all
things hebdomically; for they evolve the intelligible, and at the same
time intellectual triads, into intellectual hebdomads, and expand
their contracted powers into intellectual variety.” Seven is what is
called by arithmeticians a <i>prime</i> number, that is, it cannot be
produced by the multiplication of other numbers. In the language of
the New Platonists, the number seven is said to be a virgin, and
without a mother, and it is therefore sacred to Minerva. The number
six is a perfect number, and is consecrated to Venus.</p>

href="#fnanchor50-4">50</a></span> Procl. v. 3, Taylor’s
translation.</div>
<p>The relations of space were dealt with in like manner, the
Geometrical properties being associated with such physical and
metaphysical notions as vague thought and lively feeling could anyhow
connect with them. We may consider, as an example of this,<a
id="fnanchor51-4" href="#note51-4"><span
class="fnanchor">51</span></a> Plato’s opinion <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page218">218</a></span> concerning the
particles of the four elements. He gave to each kind of particle one
of the five regular solids, about which the geometrical speculations
of himself and his pupils had been employed. The particles of fire
were pyramids, because they are sharp, and tend upwards; those of
earth are cubes, because they are stable, and fill space; the
particles of air are octahedral, as most nearly resembling those of
fire; those of water are the icositetrahedron, as most nearly
spherical. The dodecahedron is the figure of the element of the
heavens, and shows its influence in other things, as in the twelve
signs of the zodiac. In such examples we see how loosely space and
number are combined or confounded by these mystical visionaries.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note51-4"
href="#fnanchor51-4">51</a></span> Stanley, <i>Hist. Phil.</i></div>
<p>These numerical dreams of ancient philosophers have been imitated
by modern writers; for instance, by Peter Bungo and Kircher, who have
written De Mysteriis Numerorum. Bungo treats of the mystical
properties of each of the numbers in order, at great length. And such
speculations have influenced astronomical theories. In the first
edition of the Alphonsine Tables,<a id="fnanchor52-4"
href="#note52-4"><span class="fnanchor">52</span></a> the precession
was represented by making the first point of Aries move, in a period
of 7000 years, through a circle of which the radius was 18 degrees,
while the circle moved round the ecliptic in 49,000 years; and these
numbers, 7000 and 49,000, were chosen probably by Jewish calculators,
or with reference to Jewish Sabbatarian notions.</p>

<p>3. <i>Astrology.</i>&#8212;Of all the forms which mysticism
assumed, none was cultivated more assiduously than astrology. Although
this art prevailed most universally and powerfully during the
stationary period, its existence, even as a detailed technical system,
goes back to a very early age. It probably had its origin in the East;
it is universally ascribed to the Babylonians and Chaldeans; the name
<i>Chaldean</i> was, at Rome, synonymous with <i>mathematicus</i>, or
astrologer; and we read repeatedly that this class of persons were
expelled from Italy by a decree of the senate, both during the times
of the republic and of the empire.<a id="fnanchor53-4"
href="#note53-4"><span class="fnanchor">53</span></a> The recurrence
of this act of legislation shows that it was not effectual: “It is a
class of men,” says Tacitus, “which, in our city, will always be
prohibited, and will always exist.” In Greece, it does not appear that
the state showed any hostility to the professors of this art. They
undertook, it would seem, then, as at a later period, to determine the
course of a man’s character and life from the configuration of the
stars at the moment of his birth. We do not possess any of the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page219">219</a></span> speculations of the
early astrologers; and we cannot therefore be certain that the notions
which operated in men’s minds when the art had its birth, agreed with
the views on which it was afterwards defended, when it became a matter
of controversy. But it appears probable, that, though it was at later
periods supported by physical analogies, it was originally suggested
by mythological belief. The Greeks spoke of the <i>influences</i> or
<i>effluxes</i> (ἀπόῤῥοιας) which proceeded from the stars; but the
Chaldeans had probably thought rather of the powers which they
exercised as <em>deities</em>. In whatever manner the sun, moon, and
planets came to be identified with gods and goddesses, it is clear
that the characters ascribed to these gods and goddesses regulate the
virtues and powers of the stars which bear their names. This
association, so manifestly visionary, was retained, amplified, and
pursued, in an enthusiastic spirit, instead of being rejected for more
distinct and substantial connections; and a pretended science was thus
formed, which bears the obvious stamp of mysticism.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note53-4"
href="#fnanchor53-4">53</a></span> Tacit. <i>Ann.</i> ii. 32. xii. 52.
<i>Hist.</i> I. 22, II. 62.</div>
<p>That common sense of mankind which teaches them that theoretical
opinions are to be calmly tried by their consequences and their
accordance with facts, appears to have counteracted the prevalence of
astrology in the better times of the human mind. Eudoxus, as we are
informed by Cicero,<a id="fnanchor54-4" href="#note54-4"><span
class="fnanchor">54</span></a> rejected the pretensions of the
Chaldeans; and Cicero himself reasons against them with arguments as
sensible and intelligent as could be adduced by a writer of the
present day; such as the different fortunes and characters of persons
born at the same time; and the failure of the predictions, in the case
of Pompey, Crassus, Cæsar, to whom the astrologers had foretold
glorious old age and peaceful death. He also employs an argument which
the reader would perhaps not expect from him,&#8212;the very great
remoteness of the planets as compared with the distance of the moon.
“What contagion can reach us,” he asks, “from a distance almost
infinite?”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note54-4"
href="#fnanchor54-4">54</a></span> Cic. <i>de Div.</i> ii. 42.</div>
<p>Pliny argues on the same side, and with some of the same
arguments.<a id="fnanchor55-4" href="#note55-4"><span
class="fnanchor">55</span></a> “Homer,” he says, “tells us that Hector
and Polydamus were born the same night;&#8212;men of such different
fortune. And every hour, in every part of the world, are born lords
and slaves, kings and beggars.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note55-4"
href="#fnanchor55-4">55</a></span> <i>Hist. Nat.</i> vii. 49.</div>
<p>The impression made by these arguments is marked in an anecdote
told concerning Publius Nigidius Figulus, a Roman of the time of
Julius Cæsar, whom Lucan mentions as a celebrated astrologer. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page220">220</a></span> said, that when
an opponent of the art urged as an objection the different fates of
persons born in two successive instants, Nigidius bade him make two
contiguous marks on a potter’s wheel, which was revolving rapidly near
them. On stopping the wheel, the two marks were found to be really far
removed from each other; and Nigidius is said to have received the
name of Figulus (the potter), in remembrance of this story, His
argument, says St. Augustine, who gives us the narrative, was as
fragile as the ware which the wheel manufactured.</p>
<p>As the darkening times of the Roman empire advanced, even the
stronger minds seem to have lost the clear energy which was requisite
to throw off this delusion. Seneca appears to take the influence of
the planets for granted; and even Tacitus<a id="fnanchor56-4"
href="#note56-4"><span class="fnanchor">56</span></a> seems to
hesitate. “For my own part,” says he, “I doubt; but certainly the
majority of mankind cannot be weaned from the opinion, that, at the
birth of each man, his future destiny is fixed; though some things may
fall out differently from the predictions, by the ignorance of those
who profess the art; and that thus the art is unjustly blamed,
confirmed as it is by noted examples in all ages.” The occasion which
gives rise to these reflections of the historian is the mention of
Thrasyllus, the favorite astrologer of the Emperor Tiberius, whose
skill is exemplified in the following narrative. Those who were
brought to Tiberius on any important matter, were admitted to an
interview in an apartment situated on a lofty cliff in the island of
Capreæ. They reached this place by a narrow path, accompanied by a
single freedman of great bodily strength; and on their return, if the
emperor had conceived any doubts of their trustworthiness, a single
blow buried the secret and its victim in the ocean below. After
Thrasyllus had, in this retreat, stated the results of his art as they
concerned the emperor, Tiberius asked him whether he had calculated
how long he himself had to live. The astrologer examined the aspect of
the stars, and while he did this, as the narrative states, showed
hesitation, alarm, increasing terror, and at last declared that, “the
present hour was for him critical, perhaps fatal.” Tiberius embraced
him, and told him “he was right in supposing he had been in danger,
but that he should escape it;” and made him thenceforth his
confidential counsellor.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note56-4"
href="#fnanchor56-4">56</a></span> <i>Ann.</i> vi. 22.</div>
<p>The belief in the power of astrological prediction which thus
obtained dominion over the minds of men of literary cultivation and
practical energy, naturally had a more complete sway among the
speculative <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page221">221</a></span> but
unstable minds of the later philosophical schools of Alexandria,
Athens, and Rome. We have a treatise on astrology by Proclus, which
will serve to exemplify the mystical principle in this form. It
appears as a commentary on a work on the same subject called
“Tetrabiblos,” ascribed to Ptolemy; though we may reasonably doubt
whether the author of the “Megale Syntaxis” was also the writer of the
astrological work. A few notices of the commentary of Proclus will
suffice.<a id="fnanchor57-4" href="#note57-4"><span
class="fnanchor">57</span></a> The science is defended by urging how
powerful we know the physical effects of the heavenly bodies to be.
“The sun regulates all things on earth;&#8212;the birth of animals,
the growth of fruits, the flowing of waters, the change of health,
according to the seasons: he produces heat, moisture, dryness, cold,
according to his approach to our zenith. The moon, which is the
nearest of all bodies to the earth, gives out much <em>influence</em>;
and all things, animate and inanimate, sympathize with her: rivers
increase and diminish according to her light; the advance of the sea,
and its recess, are regulated by her rising and setting; and along
with her, fruits and animals wax and wane, either wholly or in part.”
It is easy to see that by pursuing this train of associations (some
real and some imaginary) very vaguely and very enthusiastically, the
connections which astrology supposes would receive a kind of
countenance. Proclus then proceeds to state<a id="fnanchor58-4"
href="#note58-4"><span class="fnanchor">58</span></a> the doctrines of
the science. “The sun,” he says, “is productive of heat and dryness;
this power is moderate in its nature, but is more perceived than that
of the other luminaries, from his magnitude, and from the change of
seasons. The nature of the moon is for the most part moist; for being
the nearest to the earth, she receives the vapors which rise from
moist bodies, and thus she causes bodies to soften and rot. But by the
illumination she receives from the sun, she partakes in a moderate
degree of heat. Saturn is cold and dry, being most distant both from
the heating power of the sun, and the moist vapors of the earth. His
cold, however, is most prevalent, his dryness is more moderate. Both
he and the rest receive additional powers from the configurations
which they make with respect to the sun and moon.” In the same manner
it is remarked that Mars is dry and caustic, from his fiery nature,
which, indeed, his color shows. Jupiter is well compounded of warm and
moist, as is Venus. Mercury is variable in his character. From these
notions were derived others concerning the beneficial or hurtful
effect of these stars. Heat and <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page222">222</a></span> moisture are generative and creative
elements; hence the ancients, says Proclus, deemed Jupiter, and Venus,
and the Moon to have a good power; Saturn and Mercury, on the other
hand, had an evil nature.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note57-4"
href="#fnanchor57-4">57</a></span> I. 2.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note58-4"
href="#fnanchor58-4">58</a></span> I. 4.</div>
<p>Other distinctions of the character of the stars are enumerated,
equally visionary, and suggested by the most fanciful connections.
Some are masculine, and some feminine: the Moon and Venus are of the
latter kind. This appears to be merely a mythological or etymological
association. Some are diurnal, some nocturnal: the Moon and Venus are
of the latter kind, the Sun and Jupiter of the former; Saturn and Mars
are both.</p>
<p>The fixed stars, also, and especially those of the zodiac, had
especial influences and subjects assigned to them. In particular, each
sign was supposed to preside over a particular part of the body; thus
Aries had the head assigned to it, Taurus the neck, and so on.</p>
<p>The most important part of the sky in the astrologer’s
consideration, was that sign of the zodiac which rose at the moment of
the child’s birth; this was, properly speaking, the <i>horoscope</i>,
the <i>ascendant</i>, or the <i>first house</i>; the whole circuit of
the heavens being divided into twelve <i>houses</i>, in which life and
death, marriage and children, riches and honors, friends and enemies,
were distributed.</p>
<p>We need not attempt to trace the progress of this science. It
prevailed extensively among the Arabians, as we might expect from the
character of that nation. Albumasar, of Balkh in Khorasan, who
flourished in the ninth century, who was one of their greatest
astronomers, was also a great astrologer; and his work on the latter
subject, “De Magnis Conjunctionibus, Annorum Revolutionibus ac eorum
Perfectionibus,” was long celebrated in Europe. Aboazen Haly (the
writer of a treatise “De Judiciis Astrorum”), who lived in Spain in
the thirteenth century, was one of the classical authors on this
subject.</p>
<p>It will easily be supposed that when this <i>apotelesmatic</i> or
<i>judicial</i> astrology obtained firm possession of men’s minds, it
would be pursued into innumerable subtle distinctions and extravagant
conceits; and the more so, as experience could offer little or no
check to such exercises of fancy and subtlety. For the correction of
rules of astrological divination by comparison with known events,
though pretended to by many professors of the art, was far too vague
and fallible a guidance to be of any real advantage. Even in what has
been called Natural Astrology, the dependence of the weather on the
heavenly bodies, it is easy to see what a vast accumulation of
well-observed facts is requisite to establish <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page223">223</a></span> any true rule; and it is well known how
long, in spite of facts, false and groundless rules (as the dependence
of the weather on the moon) may keep their hold on men’s minds. When
the facts are such loose and many-sided things as human characters,
passions, and happiness, it was hardly to be expected that even the
most powerful minds should be able to find a footing sufficiently
firm, to enable them to resist the impression of a theory constructed
of sweeping and bold assertions, and filled out into a complete system
of details. Accordingly, the connection of the stars with human
persons and actions was, for a long period, undisputed. The vague,
obscure, and heterogeneous character of such a connection, and its
unfitness for any really scientific reasoning, could, of course, never
be got rid of; and the bewildering feeling of earnestness and
solemnity, with which the connection of the heavens with man was
contemplated, never died away. In other respects, however, the
astrologers fell into a servile commentatorial spirit; and employed
themselves in annotating and illustrating the works of their
predecessors to a considerable extent, before the revival of true
science.</p>
<p>It may be mentioned, that astrology has long been, and probably is,
an art held in great esteem and admiration among other eastern nations
besides the Mohammedans; for instance, the Jews, the Indians, the
Siamese, and the Chinese. The prevalence of vague, visionary, and
barren notions among these nations, cannot surprise us; for with
regard to them we have no evidence, as with regard to Europeans we
have, that they are capable, on subjects of physical speculation, of
originating sound and rational general principles. The Arts may have
had their birth in all parts of the globe; but it is only Europe, at
particular favored periods of its history, which has ever produced
Sciences.</p>
<p>We are, however, now speaking of a long period, during which this
productive energy was interrupted and suspended. During this period
Europe descended, in intellectual character, to the level at which the
other parts of the world have always stood. Her Science was then a
mixture of Art and Mysticism; we have considered several forms of this
Mysticism, but there are two others which must not pass unnoticed,
Alchemy and Magic.</p>
<p>We may observe, before we proceed, that the deep and settled
influence which Astrology had obtained among them, appears perhaps
most strongly in the circumstance, that the most vigorous and
clear-sighted minds which were concerned in the revival of science,
did not, for a long period, shake off the persuasion that there was,
in this art, some element of truth. Roger Bacon, Cardan, Kepler, Tycho
Brahe, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page224">224</a></span> Francis
Bacon, are examples of this. These, or most of them, rejected all the
more obvious and extravagant absurdities with which the subject had
been loaded; but still conceived that some real and valuable truth
remained when all these were removed. Thus Campanella,<a
id="fnanchor59-4" href="#note59-4"><span
class="fnanchor">59</span></a> whom we shall have to <a
href="#v1page237">speak</a> of as one of the first opponents of
Aristotle, wrote an “Astrology purified from all the Superstitions of
the Jews and Arabians, and treated physiologically.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note59-4"
href="#fnanchor59-4">59</a></span> Bacon, <i>De Aug.</i> iii. 4.</div>
<p>4. <i>Alchemy.</i>&#8212;Like other kinds of Mysticism, Alchemy
seems to have grown out of the notions of moral, personal, and
mythological qualities, which men associated with terms, of which the
primary application was to physical properties. This is the form in
which the subject is presented to us in the earliest writings which we
possess on the subject of chemistry;&#8212;those of Geber<a
id="fnanchor60-4" href="#note60-4"><span
class="fnanchor">60</span></a> of Seville, who is supposed to have
lived in the eighth or ninth century. The very titles of Geber’s works
show the notions on which this pretended science proceeds. They are,
“Of the Search of Perfection;” “Of the Sum of Perfection, or of the
Perfect Magistery;” “Of the Invention of Verity, or Perfection.” The
basis of this phraseology is the distinction of metals into more or
less <em>perfect</em>; gold being the most perfect, as being the most
valuable, most beautiful, most pure, most durable; silver the next;
and so on. The “Search of Perfection” was, therefore, the attempt to
convert other metals into gold; and doctrines were adopted which
represented the metals as all compounded of the same elements, so that
this was theoretically possible. But the mystical trains of
association were pursued much further than this; gold and silver were
held to be the most noble of metals; gold was their King, and silver
their Queen. Mythological associations were called in aid of these
fancies, as had been done in astrology. Gold was Sol, silver was Luna,
the moon; copper, iron, tin, lead, were assigned to Venus, Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn. The processes of mixture and heat were spoken of as
personal actions and relations, struggles and victories. Some elements
were conquerors, some conquered; there existed preparations which
possessed the power of changing the whole of a body into a substance
of another kind: these were called <i>magisteries</i>.<a
id="fnanchor61-4" href="#note61-4"><span
class="fnanchor">61</span></a> When gold and quicksilver are combined,
the king and the queen are married, to produce children of their own
kind. It will easily be conceived, that when chemical operations were
described in phraseology of this sort, the enthusiasm of the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page225">225</a></span> fancy would be added
to that of the hopes, and observation would not be permitted to
correct the delusion, or to suggest sounder and more rational
views.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note60-4"
href="#fnanchor60-4">60</a></span> Thomson’s <i>Hist. of Chem.</i> i.
117.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note61-4"
href="#fnanchor61-4">61</a></span> Boyle, Thomson’s <i>Hist. Ch.</i>
i. 25. Carolus Musitanus.</div>
<p>The exaggeration of the vague notion of perfection and power in the
object of the alchemist’s search, was carried further still. The same
preparation which possessed the faculty of turning baser metals into
gold, was imagined to be also a universal medicine, to have the gift
of curing or preventing diseases, prolonging life, producing bodily
strength and beauty: the <i>philosophers’ stone</i> was finally
invested with every desirable efficacy which the fancy of the
“philosophers” could devise.</p>
<p>It has been usual to say that Alchemy was the mother of Chemistry;
and that men would never have made the experiments on which the real
science is founded, if they had not been animated by the hopes and the
energy which the delusive art inspired. To judge whether this is truly
said, we must be able to estimate the degree of interest which men
feel in purely speculative truth, and in the real and substantial
improvement of art to which it leads. Since the fall of Alchemy, and
the progress of real Chemistry, these motives have been powerful
enough to engage in the study of the science, a body far larger than
the Alchemists ever were, and no less zealous. There is no apparent
reason why the result should not have been the same, if the progress
of true science had begun sooner. Astronomy was long cultivated
without the bribe of Astrology. But, perhaps, we may justly say
this;&#8212;that, in the stationary period, men’s minds were so far
enfeebled and degraded, that pure speculative truth had not its full
effect upon them; and the mystical pursuits in which some dim and
disfigured images of truth were sought with avidity, were among the
provisions by which the human soul, even when sunk below its best
condition, is perpetually directed to something above the mere objects
of sense and appetite;&#8212;a contrivance of compensation, as it
were, in the intellectual and spiritual constitution of man.</p>
<p>5. <i>Magic.</i>&#8212;Magical Arts, so far as they were believed
in by those who professed to practise them, and so far as they have a
bearing in science, stand on the same footing as astrology; and,
indeed, a close alliance has generally been maintained between the two
pursuits. Incapacity and indisposition to perceive natural and
philosophical causation, an enthusiastic imagination, and such a faith
as can devise and maintain supernatural and spiritual connexions, are
the elements of this, as of other forms of Mysticism. And thus, that
temper which led men to aim at the magician’s supposed authority over
the elements, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page226">226</a></span>
is an additional exemplification of those habits of thought which
prevented the progress of real science, and the acquisition of that
command over nature which is founded on science, during the interval
now before us.</p>
<p>But there is another aspect under which the opinions connected with
this pursuit may serve to illustrate the mental character of the
Stationary Period.</p>
<p>The tendency, during the middle ages, to attribute the character of
Magician to almost all persons eminent for great speculative or
practical knowledge, is a feature of those times, which shows how
extensive and complete was the inability to apprehend the nature of
real science. In cultivated and enlightened periods, such as those of
ancient Greece, or modern Europe, knowledge is wished for and admired,
even by those who least possess it: but in dark and degraded periods,
superior knowledge is a butt for hatred and fear. In the one case,
men’s eyes are open; their thoughts are clear; and, however high the
philosopher may be raised above the multitude, they can catch glimpses
of the intervening path, and see that it is free to all, and that
elevation is the reward of energy and labor. In the other case, the
crowd are not only ignorant, but spiritless; they have lost the
pleasure in knowledge, the appetite for it, and the feeling of dignity
which it gives: there is no sympathy which connects them with the
learned man: they see him above them, but know not how he is raised or
supported: he becomes an object of aversion and envy, of vague
suspicion and terror; and these emotions are embodied and confirmed by
association with the fancies and dogmas of superstition. To consider
superior knowledge as Magic, and Magic as a detestable and criminal
employment, was the form which these feelings of dislike assumed; and
at one period in the history of Europe, almost every one who had
gained any eminent literary fame, was spoken of as a magician.
Naudæus, a learned Frenchman, in the seventeenth century, wrote “An
Apology for all the Wise Men who have been unjustly reported
Magicians, from the Creation to the present Age.” The list of persons
whom he thus thinks it necessary to protect, are of various classes
and ages. Alkindi, Geber, Artephius, Thebit, Raymund Lully, Arnold de
Villâ Novâ, Peter of Apono, and Paracelsus, had incurred the black
suspicion as physicians or alchemists. Thomas Aquinas, Roger Bacon,
Michael Scott, Picus of Mirandula, and Trithemius, had not escaped it,
though ministers of religion. Even dignitaries, such as Robert
Grosteste, Bishop of Lincoln, Albertus Magnus, Bishop of Ratisbon,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page227">227</a></span> Popes Sylvester
the Second, and Gregory the Seventh, had been involved in the wide
calumny. In the same way in which the vulgar confounded the eminent
learning and knowledge which had appeared in recent times, with skill
in dark and supernatural arts, they converted into wizards all the
best-known names in the rolls of fame; as Aristotle, Solomon, Joseph,
Pythagoras; and, finally, the poet Virgil was a powerful and skilful
necromancer, and this fancy was exemplified by many strange stories of
his achievements and practices.</p>
<p>The various results of the tendency of the human mind to mysticism,
which we have here noticed, form prominent features in the
intellectual character of the world, for a long course of centuries.
The theosophy and theurgy of the Neoplatonists, the mystical
arithmetic of the Pythagoreans and their successors, the predictions
of the astrologers, the pretences of alchemy and magic, represent, not
unfairly, the general character and disposition of men’s thoughts,
with reference to philosophy and science. That there were stronger
minds, which threw off in a greater or less degree this train of
delusive and unsubstantial ideas, is true; as, on the other hand,
Mysticism, among the vulgar or the foolish, often went to an extent of
extravagance and superstition, of which I have not attempted to convey
any conception. The lesson which the preceding survey teaches us is,
that during the Stationary Period, Mysticism, in its various forms,
was a leading character, both of the common mind, and of the
speculations of the most intelligent and profound reasoners; and that
this Mysticism was the opposite of that habit of thought which we have
stated Science to require; namely, clear Ideas, distinctly employed to
connect well-ascertained Facts; inasmuch as the Ideas in which it
dealt were vague and unstable, and the temper in which they were
contemplated was an urgent and aspiring enthusiasm, which could not
submit to a calm conference with experience upon even terms. The
fervor of thought in some degree supplied the place of reason in
producing belief; but opinions so obtained had no enduring value; they
did not exhibit a permanent record of old truths, nor a firm
foundation for new. Experience collected her stores in vain, or ceased
to collect them, when she had only to pour them into the flimsy folds
of the lap of Mysticism; who was, in truth, so much absorbed in
looking for the treasures which were to fall from the skies, that she
heeded little how scantily she obtained, or how loosely she held, such
riches as might be found near her. <span class="pagenum"><a

<span class="sc">Of the Dogmatism of the Stationary
Period.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IN</span> speaking of the character
of the age of commentators, we noticed principally the ingenious
servility which it displays;&#8212;the acuteness with which it finds
ground for speculation in the expression of other men’s
thoughts;&#8212;the want of all vigor and fertility in acquiring any
real and new truths. Such was the character of the reasoners of the
stationary period from the first; but, at a later day, this character,
from various causes, was modified by new features. The servility which
had yielded itself to the yoke, insisted upon forcing it on the necks
of others: the subtlety which found all the truth it needed in certain
accredited writings, resolved that no one should find there, or in any
other region, any other truths; speculative men became tyrants without
ceasing to be slaves; to their character of Commentators they added
that of Dogmatists.</p>
<p>1. <i>Origin of the Scholastic Philosophy.</i>&#8212;The causes of
this change have been very happily analyzed and described by several
modern writers.<a id="fnanchor62-4" href="#note62-4"><span
class="fnanchor">62</span></a> The general nature of the process may
be briefly stated to have been the following.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note62-4"
href="#fnanchor62-4">62</a></span>  Dr. Hampden, in the Life of Thomas
Aquinas, in the <i>Encyc. Metrop.</i> Degerando, <i>Hist.
Comparée</i>, vol. iv. Also Tennemann, <i>Hist. of Phil.</i> vol.
viii. Introduction.</div>
<p>The tendencies of the later times of the Roman empire to a
commenting literature, and a second-hand philosophy, have already been
noticed. The loss of the dignity of political freedom, the want of the
cheerfulness of advancing prosperity, and the substitution of the less
philosophical structure of the Latin language for the delicate
intellectual mechanism of the Greek, fixed and augmented the prevalent
feebleness and barrenness of intellect. Men forgot, or feared, to
consult nature, to seek for new truths, to do what the great
discoverers of other times had done; they were content to consult
libraries, to study and defend old opinions, to talk of what great
geniuses had said. They sought their philosophy in accredited
treatises, and dared not question such doctrines as they there
found.</p>
<p>The character of the philosophy to which they were thus led, was
determined by this want of courage and originality. There are various
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page229">229</a></span> antagonist
principles of opinion, which seem alike to have their root in the
intellectual constitution of man, and which are maintained and
developed by opposing sects, when the intellect is in vigorous action.
Such principles are, for instance,&#8212;the claims of Authority and
of Reason to our assent;&#8212;the source of our knowledge in
Experience or in Ideas;&#8212;the superiority of a Mystical or of a
Skeptical turn of thought. Such oppositions of doctrine were found in
writers of the greatest fame; and two of those, who most occupied the
attention of students, Plato and Aristotle, were, on several points of
this nature, very diverse from each other in their tendency. The
attempt to reconcile these philosophers by Boëthius and others, we
have <a href="#v1page206">already</a> noticed; and the attempt was so
far successful, that it left on men’s minds the belief in the
possibility of a great philosophical system which should be based on
both these writers, and have a claim to the assent of all sober
speculators.</p>
<p>But, in the mean time, the Christian Religion had become the
leading subject of men’s thoughts; and divines had put forward its
claims to be, not merely the guide of men’s lives, and the means of
reconciling them to their heavenly Master, but also to be a Philosophy
in the widest sense in which the term had been used;&#8212;a
consistent speculative view of man’s condition and nature, and of the
world in which he is placed.</p>
<p>These claims had been acknowledged; and, unfortunately, from the
intellectual condition of the times, with no due apprehension of the
necessary ministry of Observation, and Reason dealing with
observation, by which alone such a system can be embodied. It was held
without any regulating principle, that the philosophy which had been
bequeathed to the world by the great geniuses of heathen antiquity,
and the Philosophy which was deduced from, and implied by, the
Revelations made by God to man, must be identical; and, therefore,
that Theology is the only true philosophy. Indeed, the Neoplatonists
had already arrived, by other roads, at the same conviction. John Scot
Erigena, in the reign of Alfred, and consequently before the existence
of the Scholastic Philosophy, properly so called, had reasserted this
doctrine.<a id="fnanchor63-4" href="#note63-4"><span
class="fnanchor">63</span></a> Anselm, in the eleventh century, again
brought it forward;<a id="fnanchor64-4" href="#note64-4"><span
class="fnanchor">64</span></a> and Bernard de Chartres, in the
thirteenth.<a id="fnanchor65-4" href="#note65-4"><span

<p>This view was confirmed by the opinion which prevailed, concerning
the nature of philosophical truth; a view supported by the theory
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page230">230</a></span> of Plato, the
practice of Aristotle, and the general propensities of the human mind:
I mean the opinion that all science may be obtained by the use of
reasoning alone;&#8212;that by analysing and combining the notions
which common language brings before us, we may learn all that we can
know. Thus Logic came to include the whole of Science; and accordingly
this Abelard expressly maintained.<a id="fnanchor66-4"
href="#note66-4"><span class="fnanchor">66</span></a> I have <a
href="#v1page63">already</a> explained, in some measure, the fallacy
of this belief, which consists, as has been well said,<a
id="fnanchor67-4" href="#note67-4"><span
class="fnanchor">67</span></a> “in mistaking the universality of the
theory of language for the generalization of facts.” But on all
accounts this opinion is readily accepted; and it led at once to the
conclusion, that the Theological Philosophy which we have described,
is complete as well as true.</p>

<p>Thus a Universal Science was established, with the authority of a
Religious Creed. Its universality rested on erroneous views of the
relation of words and truths; its pretensions as a science were
admitted by the servile temper of men’s intellects; and its religious
authority was assigned it, by making all truth part of religion. And
as Religion claimed assent within her own jurisdiction under the most
solemn and imperative sanctions, Philosophy shared in her imperial
power, and dissent from their doctrines was no longer blameless or
allowable. Error became wicked, dissent became heresy; to reject the
received human doctrines, was nearly the same as to doubt the Divine
declarations. The <i>Scholastic Philosophy</i> claimed the assent of
all believers.</p>
<p>The external form, the details, and the text of this philosophy,
were taken, in a great measure, from Aristotle; though, in the spirit,
the general notions, and the style of interpretation, Plato and the
Platonists had no inconsiderable share. Various causes contributed to
the elevation of Aristotle to this distinction. His Logic had early
been adopted as an instrument of theological disputation; and his
spirit of systematization, of subtle distinction, and of analysis of
words, as well as his disposition to argumentation, afforded the most
natural and grateful employment to the commentating propensities.
Those principles which we before noted as the leading points of his
physical philosophy, were selected and adopted; and these, presented
in a most technical form, and applied in a systematic manner,
constitute a large portion of the philosophy of which we now speak, so
far as it pretends to deal with physics.</p>
<p>2. <i>Scholastic Dogmas.</i>&#8212;But before the complete
ascendancy of Aristotle was thus established, when something of an
intellectual waking <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page231">231</a></span> took place after the darkness and sleep
of the ninth and tenth centuries, the Platonic doctrines seem to have
had, at first, a strong attraction for men’s minds, as better falling
in with the mystical speculations and contemplative piety which
belonged to the times. John Scot Erigena<a id="fnanchor68-4"
href="#note68-4"><span class="fnanchor">68</span></a> may be looked
upon as the reviver of the New Platonism in the tenth century. Towards
the end of the eleventh, Peter Damien,<a id="fnanchor69-4"
href="#note69-4"><span class="fnanchor">69</span></a> in Italy,
reproduced, involved in a theological discussion, some Neoplatonic
ideas. Godefroy<a id="fnanchor70-4" href="#note70-4"><span
class="fnanchor">70</span></a> also, censor of St. Victor, has left a
treatise, entitled <i>Microcosmus</i>; this is founded on a mystical
analogy, often afterwards again brought forward, between Man and the
Universe. “Philosophers and theologians,” says the writer, “agree in
considering man as a little world; and as the world is composed of
four elements, man is endowed with four faculties, the senses, the
imagination, reason, and understanding.” Bernard of Chartres,<a
id="fnanchor71-4" href="#note71-4"><span
class="fnanchor">71</span></a> in his <i>Megascosmus</i> and
<i>Microcosmus</i>, took up the same notions. Hugo, abbot of St.
Victor, made a contemplative life the main point and crown of his
philosophy; and is said to have been the first of the scholastic
writers who made psychology his special study.<a id="fnanchor72-4"
href="#note72-4"><span class="fnanchor">72</span></a> He says the
faculties of the mind are “the senses, the imagination, the reason,
the memory, the understanding, and the intelligence.”</p>

<p>Physics does not originally and properly form any prominent part of
the Scholastic Philosophy, which consists mainly of a series of
questions and determinations upon the various points of a certain
technical divinity. Of this kind is the <i>Book of Sentences</i> of
Peter the Lombard (bishop of Paris), who is, on that account, usually
called “Magister Sententiarum;” a work which was published in the
twelfth century, and was long the text and standard of such
discussions. The questions are decided by the authority of Scripture
and of the Fathers of the Church, and are divided into four Books, of
which the first contains questions concerning God and the doctrine of
the Trinity in particular; the second is concerning the Creation; the
third, concerning Christ and the Christian Religion; and the fourth
treats of Religious and Moral Duties. In the second book, as in many
of the writers of this time, the nature of Angels is considered in
detail, and the Orders of their Hierarchy, of which there were held to
be nine. The physical discussions enter only as bearing upon the
scriptural history of the creation, and cannot be taken as a specimen
of the work; but I may observe, that in speaking of the division of
the waters above the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page232">232</a></span> firmament, he gives one opinion, that of
Bede, that the former waters are the solid crystalline heavens in
which the stars are fixed,<a id="fnanchor73-4" href="#note73-4"><span
class="fnanchor">73</span></a> “for crystal, which is so hard and
transparent, is made of water.” But he mentions also the opinion of
St. Augustine, that the waters above the heavens are in a state of
vapor, (<i>vaporaliter</i>) and in minute drops; “if, then, water
can, as we see in clouds, be so minutely divided that it may be thus
supported as vapor on air, which is naturally lighter than water; why
may we not believe that it floats above that lighter celestial element
in still minuter drops and still lighter vapors? But in whatever
manner the waters are there, we do not doubt that they are there.”</p>

secundæ diei</i>.</div>
<p id="summa">The celebrated <i>Summa Theologicæ</i> of Thomas Aquinas
is a work of the same kind; and anything which has a physical bearing
forms an equally small part of it. Thus, of the 512 Questions of the
<i>Summa</i>, there is only one (Part I., Quest. 115), “on Corporeal
Action,” or on any part of the material world; though there are
several concerning the celestial Hierarchies, as “on the Act of
Angels,” “on the Speaking of Angels,” “on the Subordination of
Angels,” “on Guardian Angels,” and the like. This, of course, would
not be remarkable in a treatise on Theology, except this Theology were
intended to constitute the whole of Philosophy.</p>
<p>We may observe, that in this work, though Plato, Avecibron, and
many other heathen as well as Christian philosophers, are adduced as
authority, Aristotle is referred to in a peculiar manner as “the
philosopher.” This is noticed by John of Salisbury, as attracting
attention in his time (he died <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1182).
“The various Masters of Dialectic,” says he,<a id="fnanchor74-4"
href="#note74-4"><span class="fnanchor">74</span></a> “shine each with
his peculiar merit; but all are proud to worship the footsteps of
Aristotle; so much so, indeed, that the name of <i>philosopher</i>,
which belongs to them all, has been pre-eminently appropriated to him.
He is called the philosopher <i>autonomatice</i>, that is, by
excellence.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note74-4"
href="#fnanchor74-4">74</a></span> <i>Metalogicus</i>, lib. ii. cap.
16.</div>
<p>The Question concerning Corporeal Action, in Aquinas, is divided
into six Articles; and the conclusion delivered upon the first is,<a
id="fnanchor75-4" href="#note75-4"><span
class="fnanchor">75</span></a> that “Body being compounded of power
and act, is active as well as passive.” Against this it is urged, that
quantity is an attribute of body, and that quantity prevents action;
that this appears in fact, since a larger body is more difficult to
move. The author replies, that <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page233">233</a></span> “quantity does not prevent corporeal
form from action altogether, but prevents it from being a universal
agent, inasmuch as the form is individualized, which, in matter
subject to quantity, it is. Moreover, the illustration deduced from
the ponderousness of bodies is not to the purpose; first, because the
addition of quantity is not the cause of gravity, as is proved in the
fourth book, De Cœlo and De Mundo” (we see that he quotes familiarly
the physical treatises of Aristotle); “second, because it is false
that ponderousness makes motion slower; on the contrary, in proportion
as any thing is heavier, the more does it move with its proper motion;
thirdly, because action does not take place by local motion, as
Democritus asserted; but by this, that something is drawn from power
into act.”</p>

<p>It does not belong to our purpose to consider either the
theological or the metaphysical doctrines which form so large a
portion of the treatises of the schoolmen. Perhaps it may hereafter
appear, that some light is thrown on some of the questions which have
occupied metaphysicians in all ages, by that examination of the
history of the Progressive Sciences in which we are now engaged; but
till we are able to analyze the leading controversies of this kind, it
would be of little service to speak of them in detail. It may be
noticed, however, that many of the most prominent of them refer to the
great question, “What is the relation between actual things and
general terms?” Perhaps in modern times, the actual things would be
more commonly taken as the point to start from; and men would begin by
considering how classes and universals are obtained from individuals.
But the schoolmen, founding their speculations on the received modes
of considering such subjects, to which both Aristotle and Plato had
contributed, travelled in the opposite direction, and endeavored to
discover how individuals were deduced from genera and
species;&#8212;what was “the Principle of Individuation.” This was
variously stated by different reasoners. Thus Bonaventura<a
id="fnanchor76-4" href="#note76-4"><span
class="fnanchor">76</span></a> solves the difficulty by the aid of the
Aristotelian distinction of Matter and Form. The individual derives
from the Form the property of <i>being something</i>, and from the
Matter the property of being that <i>particular thing</i>. Duns
Scotus,<a id="fnanchor77-4" href="#note77-4"><span
class="fnanchor">77</span></a> the great adversary of Thomas Aquinas
in theology, placed the principle of Individuation in “a certain
determining positive entity,” which his school called <i>Hæcceity</i>
or <i>thisness</i>. “Thus an individual man is Peter, because his
<i>humanity</i> is combined with<i> Petreity</i>.” The force <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page234">234</a></span> of abstract terms is
a curious question, and some remarkable experiments in their use had
been made by the Latin Aristotelians before this time. In the same way
in which we talk of the <i>quantity</i> and <i>quality</i> of a thing,
they spoke of its <i>quiddity</i>.<a id="fnanchor78-4"

<p>We may consider the reign of mere disputation as fully established
at the time of which we are now speaking; and the only kind of
philosophy henceforth studied was one in which no sound physical
science had or could have a place. The wavering abstractions,
indistinct generalizations, and loose classifications of common
language, which we have already noted as the fountain of the physics
of the Greek Schools of philosophy, were also the only source from
which the Schoolmen of the middle ages drew their views, or rather
their arguments: and though these notional and verbal relations were
invested with a most complex and pedantic technicality, they did not,
on that account, become at all more precise as notions, or more likely
to lead to a single real truth. Instead of acquiring distinct ideas,
they multiplied abstract terms; instead of real generalizations, they
had recourse to verbal distinctions. The whole course of their
employments tended to make them, not only ignorant of physical truth,
but incapable of conceiving its nature.</p>
<p>Having thus taken upon themselves the task of raising and
discussing questions by means of abstract terms, verbal distinctions,
and logical rules alone, there was no tendency in their activity to
come to an end, as there was no progress. The same questions, the same
answers, the same difficulties, the same solutions, the same verbal
subtleties,&#8212;sought for, admired, cavilled at, abandoned,
reproduced, and again admired,&#8212;might recur without limit. John
of Salisbury<a id="fnanchor79-4" href="#note79-4"><span
class="fnanchor">79</span></a> observes of the Parisian teachers,
that, after several years’ absence, he found them not a step advanced,
and still employed in urging and parrying the same arguments; and
this, as Mr. Hallam remarks,<a id="fnanchor80-4"
href="#note80-4"><span class="fnanchor">80</span></a> “was equally
applicable to the period of centuries.” The same knots were tied and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page235">235</a></span> untied; the
same clouds were formed and dissipated. The poet’s censure of “the
Sons of Aristotle,” is just as happily expressed:</p>

<p>It will therefore be unnecessary to go into any detail respecting
the history of the School Philosophy of the thirteenth, fourteenth,
and fifteenth centuries. We may suppose it to have been, during the
intermediate time, such as it was at first and at last. An occasion to
consider its later days will be brought before us by the course of our
subject. But, even during the most entire ascendency of the scholastic
doctrines, the elements of change were at work. While the doctors and
the philosophers received all the ostensible homage of men, a doctrine
and a philosophy of another kind were gradually forming: the practical
instincts of man, their impatience of tyranny, the progress of the
useful arts, the promises of alchemy, were all disposing men to reject
the authority and deny the pretensions of the received philosophical
creed. Two antagonist forms of opinion were in existence, which for
some time went on detached, and almost independent of each other; but,
finally, these came into conflict, at the time of Galileo; and the war
speedily extended to every part of civilized Europe.</p>
<p>3. <i>Scholastic Physics.</i>&#8212;It is difficult to give briefly
any appropriate examples of the nature of the Aristotelian physics
which are to be found in the works of this time. As the gravity of
bodies was one of the first subjects of dispute when the struggle of
the rival methods began, we may notice the mode in which it was
treated.<a id="fnanchor81-4" href="#note81-4"><span
class="fnanchor">81</span></a> “Zabarella maintains that the proximate
cause of the motion of elements is the <i>form</i>, in the
Aristotelian sense of the term: but to this sentence we,” says
Keckerman, “cannot agree; for in all other things the <i>form</i> is
the proximate cause, not of the <i>act</i>, but of the power or
faculty from which the act flows. Thus in man, the rational soul is
not the cause of the act of laughing, but of the risible faculty or
power.” Keckerman’s system was at one time a work of considerable
authority: it was published in 1614. By comparing and systematizing
what he finds in Aristotle, he is led to state his results in the form
of definitions <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page236">236</a></span>
and theorems. Thus, “gravity is a motive quality, arising from cold,
density, and bulk, by which the elements are carried downwards.”
“Water is the lower, intermediate element, cold and moist.” The first
theorem concerning water is, “The moistness of the water is controlled
by its coldness, so that it is less than the moistness of the air;
though, according to the sense of the vulgar, water appears to moisten
more than air.” It is obvious that the two properties of fluids, to
have their parts easily moved, and to wet other bodies, are here
confounded. I may, as a concluding specimen of this kind, mention
those propositions or maxims concerning fluids, which were so firmly
established, that, when Boyle propounded the true mechanical
principles of fluid action, he was obliged to state his opinions as
“hydrostatical <em>paradoxes</em>.” These were,&#8212;that fluids do
not gravitate <i>in proprio loco</i>; that is, that water has no
gravity in or on water, since it is in its own place;&#8212;that air
has no gravity on water, since it is above water, which is its proper
place;&#8212;that earth in water tends to descend, since its place is
below water;&#8212;that the water rises in a pump or siphon, because
nature abhors a vacuum;&#8212;that some bodies have a positive levity
in others, as oil in water; and the like.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note81-4"
href="#fnanchor81-4">81</a></span> Keckerman, p. 1428.</div>
<p>4. <i>Authority of Aristotle among the Schoolmen.</i>&#8212;The
authority of Aristotle, and the practice of making him the text and
basis of the system, especially as it regarded physics, prevailed
during the period of which we speak. This authority was not, however,
without its fluctuations. Launoy has traced one part of its history in
a book <i>On the various Fortune of Aristotle in the University of
Paris</i>. The most material turns of this fortune depend on the
bearing which the works of Aristotle were supposed to have upon
theology. Several of Aristotle’s works, and more especially his
metaphysical writings, had been translated into Latin, and were
explained in the schools of the University of Paris, as early as the
beginning of the thirteenth century.<a id="fnanchor82-4"
href="#note82-4"><span class="fnanchor">82</span></a> At a council
held at Paris in 1209, they were prohibited, as having given occasion
to the heresy of Almeric (or Amauri), and because “they might give
occasion to other heresies not yet invented.” The Logic of Aristotle
recovered its credit some years after this, and was publicly taught in
the University of Paris in the year 1215; but the Natural Philosophy
and Metaphysics were prohibited by a decree of Gregory the Ninth, in
1231. The Emperor Frederic the Second employed a number of learned men
to translate into Latin, from the Greek and <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page237">237</a></span> Arabic, certain books of Aristotle, and
of other ancient sages; and we have a letter of Peter de Vineis, in
which they are recommended to the attention of the University of
Bologna: probably the same recommendation was addressed to other
Universities. Both Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas wrote
commentaries on Aristotle’s works; and as this was done soon after the
decree of Gregory the Ninth, Launoy is much perplexed to reconcile the
fact with the orthodoxy of the two doctors. Campanella, who was one of
the first to cast off the authority of Aristotle, says, “We are by no
means to think that St. Thomas <em>aristotelized</em>; he only
expounded Aristotle, that he might correct his errors; and I should
conceive he did this with the license of the Pope.” This statement,
however, by no means gives a just view of the nature of Albertus’s and
Aquinas’s commentaries. Both have followed their author with profound
deference.<a id="fnanchor83-4" href="#note83-4"><span
class="fnanchor">83</span></a> For instance, Aquinas<a
id="fnanchor84-4" href="#note84-4"><span
class="fnanchor">84</span></a> attempts to defend Aristotle’s
assertion, that if there were no resistance, a body would move through
a space in no time; and the same defence is given by Scotus.</p>

<p>We may imagine the extent of authority and admiration which
Aristotle would attain, when thus countenanced, both by the powerful
and the learned. In universities, no degree could be taken without a
knowledge of the philosopher. In 1452, Cardinal Totaril established
this rule in the University of Paris.<a id="fnanchor85-4"
href="#note85-4"><span class="fnanchor">85</span></a> When Ramus, in
1543, published an attack upon Aristotle, it was repelled by the power
of the court, and the severity of the law. Francis the First published
an edict, in which he states that he had appointed certain judges, who
had been of opinion,<a id="fnanchor86-4" href="#note86-4"><span
class="fnanchor">86</span></a> “que le dit Ramus avoit été téméraire,
arrogant et impudent; et que parcequ’en son livre des animadversions
il reprenait Aristotle, estait évidemment connue et manifeste son
ignorance.” The books are then declared to be suppressed. It was often
a complaint of pious men, that theology was corrupted by the influence
of Aristotle and his commentators. Petrarch says,<a id="fnanchor87-4"
href="#note87-4"><span class="fnanchor">87</span></a> that one of the
Italian learned men conversing with him, after expressing much
contempt for the apostles and fathers, exclaimed, “Utinam tu Averroen
pati posses, ut videres quanto ille tuis his nugatoribus major
sit!”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note85-4"

<p>When the revival of letters began to take place, and a number of
men of ardent and elegant minds, susceptible to the impressions of
beauty of style and dignity of thought, were brought into contact with
Greek literature, Plato had naturally greater charms for them. A <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page238">238</a></span> powerful school of
Platonists (not Neoplatonists) was formed in Italy, including some of
the principal scholars and men of genius of the time; as Picus of
Mirandula in the middle, Marsilius Ficinus at the end, of the
fifteenth century. At one time, it appeared as if the ascendency of
Aristotle was about to be overturned; but, in physics at least, his
authority passed unshaken through this trial. It was not by
disputation that Aristotle could be overthrown; and the Platonists
were not persons whose doctrines led them to use the only decisive
method in such cases, the observation and unfettered interpretation of
facts.</p>
<p>The history of their controversies, therefore, does not belong to
our design. For like reasons we do not here speak of other authors,
who opposed the scholastic philosophy on general theoretical grounds
of various kinds. Such examples of insurrection against the dogmatism
which we have been reviewing, are extremely interesting events in the
history of the philosophy of science. But, in the present work, we are
to confine ourselves to the history of science itself; in the hope
that we may thus be able, hereafter, to throw a steadier light upon
that philosophy by which the succession of stationary and progressive
periods, which we are here tracing, may be in some measure explained.
We are now to close our account of the stationary period, and to enter
upon the great subject of the progress of physical science in modern
times.</p>
<p>5. <i>Subjects omitted. Civil Law, Medicine.</i>&#8212;My object
has been to make my way, as rapidly as possible, to this period of
progress; and in doing this, I have had to pass over a long and barren
track, where almost all traces of the right road disappear. In
exploring this region, it is not without some difficulty that he who
is travelling with objects such as mine, continues a steady progress
in the proper direction; for many curious and attractive subjects of
research come in his way: he crosses the track of many a controversy,
which in its time divided the world of speculators, and of which the
results may be traced, even now, in the conduct of moral, or
political, or metaphysical discussions; or in the common associations
of thought, and forms of language. The wars of the Nominalists and
Realists; the disputes concerning the foundations of morals, and the
motives of human actions; the controversies concerning predestination,
free will, grace, and the many other points of metaphysical divinity;
the influence of theology and metaphysics upon each other, and upon
other subjects of human curiosity; the effects of opinion upon
politics, and of political condition upon opinion; the influence of
literature and philosophy <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page239">239</a></span> upon each other, and upon society; and
many other subjects;&#8212;might be well worth examination, if our
hope of success did not reside in pursuing, steadily and directly,
those inquiries in which we can look for a definite and certain reply.
We must even neglect two of the leading studies of those times, which
occupied much of men’s time and thoughts, and had a very great
influence on society; the one dealing with Notions, the other with
Things; the one employed about moral rules, the other about material
causes, but both for practical ends; I mean, the study of the <i>Civil
Law</i>, and of <i>Medicine</i>. The second of these studies will
hereafter come before us, as one of the principal occasions which led
to the cultivation of chemistry; but, in itself, its progress is of
too complex and indefinite a nature to be advantageously compared with
that of the more exact sciences. The Roman Law is held, by its
admirers, to be a system of deductive science, as exact as the
mathematical sciences themselves; and it may, therefore, be useful to
consider it, if we should, in the sequel, have to examine how far
there can exist an analogy between moral and physical science. But,
after a few more words on the middle ages, we must return to our task
of tracing the progress of the latter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Progress of the Arts in the Middle Ages.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">ART and Science.</span>&#8212;I
shall, before I resume the history of science, say a few words on the
subject described in the title of this chapter, both because I might
otherwise be accused of doing injustice to the period now treated of;
and also, because we shall by this means bring under our notice some
circumstances which were important as being the harbingers of the
revival of progressive knowledge.</p>
<p>The accusation of injustice towards the state of science in the
middle ages, if we were to terminate our survey of them with what has
hitherto been said, might be urged from obvious topics. How do we
recognize, it might be asked, in a picture of mere confusion and
mysticism of thought, of servility and dogmatism of character, the
powers and acquirements to which we owe so many of the most important
inventions which we now enjoy? Parchment and paper, printing and
engraving, improved glass and steel, gunpowder, clocks, telescopes,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page240">240</a></span> the mariner’s
compass, the reformed calendar, the decimal notation, algebra,
trigonometry, chemistry, counterpoint, an invention equivalent to a
new creation of music;&#8212;these are all possessions which we
inherit from that which has been so disparagingly termed the
Stationary Period. Above all, let us look at the monuments of
architecture of this period;&#8212;the admiration and the despair of
modern architects, not only for their beauty, but for the skill
disclosed in their construction. With all these evidences before us,
how can we avoid allowing that the masters of the middle ages not only
made some small progress in Astronomy, which has, grudgingly as it
would seem, been admitted in a former Book; but also that they were no
small proficients in other sciences, in Optics, in Harmonics, in
Physics, and, above all, in Mechanics?</p>
<p>If, it may be added, we are allowed, in the present day, to refer
to the perfection of our arts as evidence of the advanced state of our
physical philosophy;&#8212;if our steam-engines, our gas-illumination,
our buildings, our navigation, our manufactures, are cited as triumphs
of science;&#8212;shall not prior inventions, made under far heavier
disadvantages,&#8212;shall not greater works, produced in an earlier
state of knowledge, also be admitted as witnesses that the middle ages
had their share, and that not a small or doubtful one, of science?</p>
<p>To these questions I answer, by distinguishing between Art, and
Science in that sense of general Inductive Systematic Truth, which it
bears in this work. To separate and compare, with precision, these two
processes, belongs to the Philosophy of Induction; and the attempt
must be reserved for another place: but the leading differences are
sufficiently obvious. Art is practical, Science is speculative: the
former is seen in doing; the latter rests in the contemplation of what
is known. The Art of the builder appears in his edifice, though he may
never have meditated on the abstract propositions on which its
stability and strength depends. The Science of the mathematical
mechanician consists in his seeing that, under certain conditions,
bodies must sustain each other’s pressure, though he may never have
applied his knowledge in a single case.</p>
<p>Now the remark which I have to make is this:&#8212;in all cases the
Arts are prior to the related Sciences. Art is the parent, not the
progeny, of Science; the realization of principles in practice forms
part of the prelude, as well as of the sequel, of theoretical
discovery. And thus the inventions of the middle ages, which have been
above enumerated, though at the present day they may be portions of
our sciences, are no evidence that the sciences then existed; but only
that <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page241">241</a></span> those
powers of practical observation and practical skill were at work,
which prepare the way for theoretical views and scientific
discoveries.</p>
<p>It may be urged, that the great works of art do virtually take for
granted principles of science; and that, therefore, it is unreasonable
to deny science to great artists. It may be said, that the grand
structures of Cologne, or Amiens, or Canterbury, could not have been
erected without a profound knowledge of mechanical principles.</p>
<p>To this we reply, that <em>such</em> knowledge is manifestly not of
the nature of that which we call <em>science</em>. If the beautiful
and skilful structures of the middle ages prove that mechanics then
existed as a science, mechanics must have existed as a science also
among the builders of the Cyclopean walls of Greece and Italy, or of
our own Stonehenge; for the masses which are there piled on each
other, could not be raised without considerable mechanical skill. But
we may go much further. The actions of every man who raises and
balances weights, or walks along a pole, take for granted the laws of
equilibrium; and even animals constantly avail themselves of such
principles. Are these, then, acquainted with mechanics as a science?
Again, if actions which are performed by taking advantage of
mechanical properties prove a knowledge of the science of mechanics,
they must also be allowed to prove a knowledge of the science of
geometry, when they proceed on geometrical properties. But the most
familiar actions of men and animals proceed upon geometrical truths.
The Epicureans held, as Proclus informs us, that even asses knew that
two sides of a triangle are greater than the third. And animals may
truly be said to have a practical knowledge of this truth; but they
have not, therefore, a science of geometry. And in like manner among
men, if we consider the matter strictly, a practical assumption of a
principle does not imply a speculative knowledge of it.</p>
<p>We may, in another way also, show how inadmissible are the works of
the Master Artists of the middle ages into the series of events which
mark the advance of Science. The following maxim is applicable to a
history, such as we are here endeavoring to write. We are employed in
tracing the progress of such general principles as constitute each of
the sciences which we are reviewing; and no facts or subordinate
truths belong to our scheme, except so far as they tend to or are
included in these higher principles; nor are they important to us, any
further than as they prove such principles. Now with regard to
processes of art like those which we have referred to, namely, the
inventions of the middle ages, let us ask, <em>what</em> principle
each of them <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page242">242</a></span>
illustrates? What chemical doctrine rests for its support on the
phenomena of gunpowder, or glass, or steel? What new harmonical truth
was illustrated in the Gregorian chant? What mechanical principle
unknown to Archimedes was displayed in the printing-press? The
practical value and use, the ingenuity and skill of these inventions
is not questioned; but what is their place in the history of
speculative knowledge? Even in those cases in which they enter into
such a history, how minute a figure do they make! how great is the
contrast between their practical and theoretical importance! They may
in their operation have changed the face of the world; but in the
history of the principles of the sciences to which they belong, they
may be omitted without being missed.</p>
<p>As to that part of the objection which was stated by asking, why,
if the arts of our age prove its scientific eminence, the arts of the
middle ages should not be received as proof of theirs; we must reply
to it, by giving up some of the pretensions which are often put
forwards on behalf of the science of our times. The perfection of the
mechanical and other arts among us proves the advanced condition of
our sciences, only in so far as these arts have been perfected by the
application of some great scientific truth, with a clear insight into
its nature. The greatest improvement of the steam-engine was due to
the steady apprehension of an atmological doctrine by Watt; but what
distinct theoretical principle is illustrated by the beautiful
manufactures of porcelain, or steel, or glass? A chemical view of
these compounds, which would explain the conditions of success and
failure in their manufacture, would be of great value in art; and it
would also be a novelty in chemical theory; so little is the present
condition of those processes a triumph of science, shedding
intellectual glory on our age. And the same might be said of many, or
of most, of the processes of the arts as now practised.</p>
<p>2. <i>Arabian Science.</i>&#8212;Having, I trust, established the
view I have stated, respecting the relation of Art and Science, we
shall be able very rapidly to dispose of a number of subjects which
otherwise might seem to require a detailed notice. Though this
distinction has been recognized by others, it has hardly been
rigorously adhered to, in consequence of the indistinct notion of
<i>science</i> which has commonly prevailed. Thus Gibbon, in speaking
of the knowledge of the period now under our notice, says,<a
id="fnanchor88-4" href="#note88-4"><span
class="fnanchor">88</span></a> “Much useful experience had been
acquired in <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page243">243</a></span> the
practice of arts and manufactures; but the <em>science</em> of
chemistry owes its origin and improvement to the industry of the
Saracens. They,” he adds, “first invented and named the alembic for
the purposes of distillation, analyzed the substances of the three
kingdoms of nature, tried the distinction and affinities of alkalies
and acids, and converted the poisonous minerals into soft and salutary
medicines.” The formation and realization of the notions of
<i>analysis</i> and of <i>affinity</i>, were important steps in
chemical science, which, as I shall hereafter endeavor to show, it
remained for the chemists of Europe to make at a much later period. If
the Arabians had done this, they might with justice have been called
the authors of the science of chemistry; but no doctrines can be
adduced from their works which give them any title to this eminent
distinction. Their claims are dissipated at once by the application of
the maxim above stated. <em>What</em> analysis of theirs tended to
establish any received principle of chemistry? <em>What</em> true
doctrine concerning the differences and affinities of acids and
alkalies did they teach? We need not wonder if Gibbon, whose views of
the boundaries of scientific chemistry were probably very wide and
indistinct, could include the arts of the Arabians within its domain;
but they cannot pass the frontier of science if philosophically
defined, and steadily guarded.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note88-4"
href="#fnanchor88-4">88</a></span> <i>Decline and Fall</i>, vol. x. p.
43.</div>
<p>The judgment which we are thus led to form respecting the chemical
knowledge of the middle ages, and of the Arabians in particular, may
serve to measure the condition of science in other departments; for
chemistry has justly been considered one of their strongest points. In
botany, anatomy, zoology, optics, acoustics, we have still the same
observations to make, that the steps in science which, in the order of
progress, next followed what the Greeks had done, were left for the
Europeans of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The merits and
advances of the Arabian philosophers in astronomy and pure
mathematics, we have already described.</p>
<p>3. <i>Experimental Philosophy of the Arabians.</i>&#8212;The
estimate to which we have thus been led, of the scientific merits of
the learned men of the middle ages, is much less exalted than that
which has been formed by many writers; and, among the rest, by some of
our own time. But I am persuaded that any attempt to answer the
questions just asked, will expose the untenable nature of the higher
claims which have been advanced in favor of the Arabians. We can
deliver no just decision, except we will consent to use the terms of
science in a strict and precise sense: and if we do this, we shall
find little, either in the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page244">244</a></span> particular discoveries or general
processes of the Arabians, which is important in the history of the
Inductive Sciences.<a id="fnanchor89-4" href="#note89-4"><span
class="fnanchor">89</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note89-4"
href="#fnanchor89-4">89</a></span> If I might take the liberty of
criticising an author who has given a very interesting view of the
period in question (<i>Mahometanism Unveiled</i>, by the Rev. Charles
Forster, 1829), I would remark, that in his work this caution is
perhaps too little observed. Thus, he says, in speaking of Alhazen
(vol. ii. p. 270), “the theory of the telescope may be found in the
work of this astronomer;” and of another, “the uses of magnifying
glasses and telescopes, and the principle of their construction, are
explained in the Great Work of (Roger) Bacon, with a truth and
clearness which have commanded universal admiration.” Such phrases
would be much too strong, even if used respecting the optical
doctrines of Kepler, which were yet incomparably more true and clear
than those of Bacon. To employ such language, in such cases, is to
deprive such terms as <i>theory</i> and <i>principle</i> of all
meaning.</div>
<p>The credit due to the Arabians for improvements in the general
methods of philosophizing, is a more difficult question; and cannot be
discussed at length by us, till we examine the history of such methods
in the abstract, which, in the present work, it is not our intention
to do.  But we may observe, that we cannot agree with those who rank
their merits high in this respect. We have already seen, that their
minds were completely devoured by the worst habits of the stationary
period,&#8212;Mysticism and Commentation. They followed their Greek
leaders, for the most part, with abject servility, and with only that
kind of acuteness and independent speculation which the Commentator’s
vocation implies. And in their choice of the standard subjects of
their studies, they fixed upon those works, the Physical Books of
Aristotle, which have never promoted the progress of science, except
in so far as they incited men to refute them; an effect which they
never produced on the Arabians. That the Arabian astronomers made some
advances beyond the Greeks, we have already stated: the two great
instances are, the discovery of the Motion of the Sun’s Apogee by
Albategnius, and the discovery (recently brought to light) of the
existence of the Moon’s Second Inequality, by Aboul Wefa. But we
cannot but observe in how different a manner they treated these
discoveries, from that with which Hipparchus or Ptolemy would have
done. The Variation of the Moon, in particular, instead of being
incorporated into the system by means of an Epicycle, as Ptolemy had
done with the Evection, was allowed, almost immediately, so far as we
can judge, to fall into neglect and oblivion: so little were the
learned Arabians prepared to take their lessons from observation as
well as from books. That in many subjects they made experiments, may
easily be allowed: there never was a period of the earth’s history,
and least of all a period of commerce <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page245">245</a></span> and manufactures, luxury and art,
medicine and engineering, in which there were not going on innumerable
processes, which may be termed Experiments; and, in addition to these,
the Arabians adopted the pursuit of alchemy, and the love of exotic
plants and animals. But so far from their being, as has been
maintained,<a id="fnanchor90-4" href="#note90-4"><span
class="fnanchor">90</span></a> a people whose “experimental intellect”
fitted them to form sciences which the “abstract intellect” of the
Greeks failed in producing, it rather appears, that several of the
sciences which the Greeks had founded, were never even comprehended by
the Arabians. I do not know any evidence that these pupils ever
attained to understand the real principles of Mechanics, Hydrostatics,
and Harmonics, which their masters had established. At any rate, when
these sciences again became progressive, Europe had to start where
Europe had stopped. There is no Arabian name which any one has thought
of interposing between Archimedes the ancient, and Stevinus and
Galileo the moderns.</p>

271.</div>
<p>4. <i>Roger Bacon.</i>&#8212;There is one writer of the middle
ages, on whom much stress has been laid, and who was certainly a most
remarkable person. Roger Bacon’s works are not only so far beyond his
age in the knowledge which they contain, but so different from the
temper of the times, in his assertion of the supremacy of experiment,
and in his contemplation of the future progress of knowledge, that it
is difficult to conceive how such a character could then exist. That
he received much of his knowledge from Arabic writers, there can be no
doubt; for they were in his time the repositories of all traditionary
knowledge. But that he derived from them his disposition to shake off
the authority of Aristotle, to maintain the importance of experiment,
and to look upon knowledge as in its infancy, I cannot believe,
because I have not myself hit upon, nor seen quoted by others, any
passages in which Arabian writers express such a disposition. On the
other hand, we do find in European writers, in the authors of Greece
and Rome, the solid sense, the bold and hopeful spirit, which suggest
such tendencies. We have already seen that Aristotle asserts, as
distinctly as words can express, that all knowledge must depend on
observation, and that science must be collected from facts by
induction. We have seen, too, that the Roman writers, and Seneca in
particular, speak with an enthusiastic confidence of the progress
which science must make in the course of ages. When Roger Bacon holds
similar language in the thirteenth century, the resemblance is
probably rather a sympathy of character, than a matter of direct
derivation; but I know of nothing <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page246">246</a></span> which proves even so much as this
sympathy in the case of Arabian philosophers.</p>
<p>A good deal has been said of late of the coincidences between his
views, and those of his great namesake in later times, Francis
Bacon.<a id="fnanchor91-4" href="#note91-4"><span
class="fnanchor">91</span></a> The resemblances consist mainly in such
points as I have just noticed; and we cannot but acknowledge, that
many of the expressions of the Franciscan Friar remind us of the large
thoughts and lofty phrases of the Philosophical Chancellor. How far
the one can be considered as having anticipated the method of the
other, we shall examine more advantageously, when we come to consider
what the character and effect of Francis Bacon’s works really are.<a

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note92-4"
href="#fnanchor92-4">92</a></span> In the <i>Philosophy of the
Inductive Sciences</i>, I have given an account at considerable length
of Roger Bacon’s mode of treating Arts and Sciences; and have also
compared more fully his philosophy with that of Francis Bacon; and I
have given a view of the bearing of this latter upon the progress of
Science in modern times. See <i>Phil. Ind. Sc.</i> book xii. chaps. 7
and 11. See also the <a href="#bacon">Appendix</a> to this
volume.</div>
<p>5. <i>Architecture of the Middle Ages.</i>&#8212;But though we are
thus compelled to disallow several of the claims which have been put
forwards in support of the scientific character of the middle ages,
there are two points in which we may, I conceive, really trace the
progress of scientific ideas among them; and which, therefore, may be
considered as the prelude to the period of discovery. I mean their
practical architecture, and their architectural treatises.</p>
<p>In a previous <a href="#v1page191">chapter</a> of this book, we
have endeavored to explain how the indistinctness of ideas, which
attended the decline of the Roman empire, appears in the forms of
their architecture;&#8212;in the disregard, which the decorative
construction exhibits, of the necessary mechanical conditions of
support. The original scheme of Greek ornamental architecture had been
horizontal masses resting on vertical columns: when the arch was
introduced by the Romans, it was concealed, or kept in a state of
subordination: and the lateral support which it required was supplied
latently, marked by some artifice. But the struggle between the
<i>mechanical</i> and the <i>decorative construction</i><a
id="fnanchor93-4" href="#note93-4"><span
class="fnanchor">93</span></a> ended in the complete disorganization
of the classical style. The <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page247">247</a></span> inconsistencies and extravagances of
which we have noticed the occurrence, were results and indications of
the fall of good architecture. The elements of the ancient system had
lost all principle of connection and regard to rule. Building became
not only a mere art, but an art exercised by masters without skill,
and without feeling for real beauty.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note93-4"
href="#fnanchor93-4">93</a></span> See Mr. Willis’s admirable
<i>Remarks on the Architecture of the Middle Ages</i>, chap. ii.<br />
&#8195;Since the publication of my first edition, Mr. Willis has shown
that much of the “mason-craft” of the middle ages consisted in the
geometrical methods by which the artists wrought out of the blocks the
complex forms of their decorative system.<br />
&#8195;To the general indistinctness of speculative notions on
mechanical subjects prevalent in the middle ages, there may have been
some exceptions, and especially so long as there were readers of
Archimedes. Boëthius had translated the mechanical works of Archimedes
into Latin, as we learn from the enumeration of his works by his
friend Cassiodorus (<i>Variar.</i> lib i. cap. 45), “<i>Mechanicum</i>
etiam Archimedem latialem siculis reddidisti.” But <i>Mechanicus</i>
was used in those times rather for one skilled in the art of
constructing wonderful machines than in the speculative theory of
them. The letter from which the quotation is taken is sent by King
Theodoric to Boëthius, to urge him to send the king a
water-clock.</div>
<p>When, after this deep decline, architecture rose again, as it did
in the twelfth and succeeding centuries, in the exquisitely beautiful
and skilful forms of the Gothic style, what was the nature of the
change which had taken place, so far as it bears upon the progress of
science? It was this:&#8212;the idea of true mechanical relations in
an edifice had been revived in men’s minds, as far as was requisite
for the purposes of art and beauty: and this, though a very different
thing from the possession of the idea as an element of speculative
science, was the proper preparation for that acquisition. The notion
of support and stability again became conspicuous in the decorative
construction, and universal in the forms of building. The eye which,
looking for beauty in definite and significant relations of parts, is
never satisfied except the weights appear to be duly supported,<a
id="fnanchor94-4" href="#note94-4"><span
class="fnanchor">94</span></a> was again gratified. Architecture threw
off its barbarous characters: a new decorative construction was
matured, not thwarting and controlling, but assisting and harmonizing
with the mechanical construction. All the ornamental parts were made
to enter into the apparent construction. Every member, almost every
moulding, became a sustainer of weight; and by the multiplicity of
props assisting each other, and the consequent subdivision of weight,
the eye was satisfied of the stability of the structure,
notwithstanding the curiously-slender forms of the separate parts. The
arch and the vault, no longer trammelled by an incompatible system of
decoration, but favoured by more tractable forms, were only limited by
the skill of the builders. Everything showed that, practically at
least, men possessed and applied, with steadiness and pleasure, the
idea of mechanical pressure and support.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note94-4"
href="#fnanchor94-4">94</a></span> Willis, pp. 15&#8211;21. I have
throughout this description of the formation of the Gothic style
availed myself of Mr. Willis’s well-chosen expressions.</div>
<p>The possession of this idea, as a principle of art, led, in the
course of time, to its speculative development as the foundation of a
science; <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page248">248</a></span> and
thus Architecture prepared the way for Mechanics. But this advance
required several centuries. The interval between the admirable
cathedrals of Salisbury, Amiens, Cologne, and the mechanical treatises
of Stevinus, is not less than three hundred years. During this time,
men were advancing towards science; but in the mean time, and perhaps
from the very beginning of the time, art had begun to decline. The
buildings of the fifteenth century, erected when the principles of
mechanical support were just on the verge of being enunciated in
general terms, exhibit those principles with a far less impressive
simplicity and elegance than those of the thirteenth. We may hereafter
inquire whether we find any other examples to countenance the belief,
that the formation of Science is commonly accompanied by the decline
of Art.</p>
<p>The leading principle of the style of the Gothic edifices was, not
merely that the weights were supported, but that they were seen to be
so; and that not only the mechanical relations of the larger masses,
but of the smaller members also, were displayed. Hence we cannot
admit, as an origin or anticipation of the Gothic, a style in which
this principle is not manifested. I do not see, in any of the
representations of the early Arabic buildings, that distribution of
weights to supports, and that mechanical consistency of parts, which
would elevate them above the character of barbarous architecture.
Their masses are broken into innumerable members, without
subordination or meaning, in a manner suggested apparently by caprice
and the love of the marvellous. “In the construction of their mosques,
it was a favorite artifice of the Arabs to sustain immense and
ponderous masses of stone by the support of pillars so slender, that
the incumbent weight seemed, as it were, suspended in the air by an
invisible hand.”<a id="fnanchor95-4" href="#note95-4"><span
class="fnanchor">95</span></a> This pleasure in the contemplation of
apparent impossibilities is a very general disposition among mankind;
but it appears to belong to the infancy, rather than the maturity of
intellect. On the other hand, the pleasure in the contemplation of
what is clear, the craving for a thorough insight into the reasons of
things, which marks the European mind, is the temper which leads to
science.</p>

255.</div>
<p>6. <i>Treatises on Architecture.</i>&#8212;No one who has attended
to the architecture which prevailed in England, France, and Germany,
from the twelfth to the fifteenth century, so far as to comprehend its
beauty, harmony, consistency, and uniformity, even in the minutest
parts and most obscure relations, can look upon it otherwise than as a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page249">249</a></span> remarkably
connected and definite artificial system. Nor can we doubt that it was
exercised by a class of artists who formed themselves by laborious
study and practice, and by communication with each other. There must
have been bodies of masters and of scholars, discipline, traditions,
precepts of art. How these associated artists diffused themselves over
Europe, and whether history enables us to trace them in a distinct
form, I shall not here discuss. But the existence of a course of
instruction, and of a body of rules of practice, is proved beyond
dispute by the great series of European cathedrals and churches, so
nearly identical in their general arrangements, and in their
particular details. The question then occurs, have these rules and
this system of instruction anywhere been committed to writing? Can we,
by such evidence, trace the progress of the scientific idea, of which
we see the working in these buildings?</p>
<p>We are not to be surprised, if, during the most flourishing and
vigorous period of the art of the middle ages, we find none of its
precepts in books. Art has, in all ages and countries, been taught and
transmitted by practice and verbal tradition, not by writing. It is
only in our own times, that the thought occurs as familiar, of
committing to books all that we wish to preserve and convey. And, even
in our own times, most of the Arts are learned far more by practice,
and by intercourse with practitioners, than by reading. Such is the
case, not only with Manufactures and Handicrafts, but with the Fine
Arts, with Engineering, and even yet, with that art, Building, of
which we are now speaking.</p>
<p>We are not, therefore, to wonder, if we have no treatises on
Architecture belonging to the great period of the Gothic
masters;&#8212;or if it appears to have required some other incitement
and some other help, besides their own possession of their practical
skill, to lead them to shape into a literary form the precepts of the
art which they knew so well how to exercise:&#8212;or if, when they
did write on such subjects, they seem, instead of delivering their own
sound practical principles, to satisfy themselves with pursuing some
of the frivolous notions and speculations which were then current in
the world of letters.</p>
<p>Such appears to be the case. The earliest treatises on Architecture
come before us under the form which the commentatorial spirit of the
middle ages inspired. They are Translations of Vitruvius, with
Annotations. In some of these, particularly that of Cesare Cesariano,
published at Como, in 1521, we see, in a very curious manner, how the
habit of assuming that, in every department of literature, the
ancients <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page250">250</a></span> must
needs be their masters, led these writers to subordinate the members
of their own architecture to the precepts of the Roman author. We have
Gothic shafts, mouldings, and arrangements, given as parallelisms to
others, which profess to represent the Roman style, but which are, in
fact, examples of that mixed manner which is called the style of the
<i>Cinque cento</i> by the Italians, of the <i>Renaissance</i> by the
French, and which is commonly included in our <i>Elizabethan</i>. But
in the early architectural works, besides the superstitions and
mistaken erudition which thus choked the growth of real architectural
doctrines, another of the peculiar elements of the middle ages comes
into view;&#8212;its mysticism. The dimensions and positions of the
various parts of edifices and of their members, are determined by
drawing triangles, squares, circles, and other figures, in such a
manner as to bound them; and to these geometrical figures were
assigned many abstruse significations. The plan and the front of the
Cathedral at Milan are thus represented in Cesariano’s work, bounded
and subdivided by various equilateral triangles; and it is easy to
see, in the earnestness with which he points out these relations, the
evidence of a fanciful and mystical turn of thought.<a
id="fnanchor96-4" href="#note96-4"><span
class="fnanchor">96</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note96-4"
href="#fnanchor96-4">96</a></span> The plan which he has given, fol.
14, he has entitled “Ichnographia Fundamenti sacræ Ædis baricephalæ,
Germanico more, à Trigono ac Pariquadrato perstructa, uti etiam ea quæ
nunc Milani videtur.”<br />
&#8195;The work of Cesariano was translated into German by Gualter
Rivius, and published at Nuremberg, in 1548, under the title of
<i>Vitruvius Teutsch</i>, with copies of the Italian diagrams. A few
years ago, in an article in the <i>Wiener Jahrbücher</i>
(Oct.&#8211;Dec., 1821), the reviewer maintained, on the authority of
the diagrams in Rivius’s book, that Gothic architecture had its origin
in Germany and not in England.</div>
<p>We thus find erudition and mysticism take the place of much of that
development of the architectural principles of the middle ages which
would be so interesting to us. Still, however, these works are by no
means without their value. Indeed many of the arts appear to flourish
not at all the worse, for being treated in a manner somewhat mystical;
and it may easily be, that the relations of geometrical figures, for
which fantastical reasons are given, may really involve principles of
beauty or stability. But independently of this, we find, in the best
works of the architects of all ages (including engineers), evidence
that the true idea of mechanical pressure exists among them more
distinctly than among men in general, although it may not be developed
in a scientific form. This is true up to our own time, and the arts
which such persons cultivate could not be successfully <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page251">251</a></span> exercised if it were
not so. Hence the writings of architects and engineers during the
middle ages do really form a prelude to the works on scientific
mechanics. Vitruvius, in his <i>Architecture</i>, and Julius
Frontinus, who, under Vespasian, wrote <i>On Aqueducts</i>, of which
he was superintendent, have transmitted to us the principal part of
what we know respecting the practical mechanics and hydraulics of the
Romans. In modern times the series is resumed. The early writers on
architecture are also writers on engineering, and often on
hydrostatics: for example, Leonardo da Vinci wrote on the equilibrium
of water. And thus we are led up to Stevinus of Bruges, who was
engineer to Prince Maurice of Nassau, and inspector of the dykes in
Holland; and in whose work, on the processes of his art, is contained
the first clear modern statement of the scientific principles of
hydrostatics.</p>
<p>Having thus explained both the obstacles and the prospects which
the middle ages offered to the progress of science, I now proceed to
the history of the progress, when that progress was once again
resumed.  ~Additional material in the <a href="#v1page512">3rd

<h3 class="space-above">INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<h4 class="five"><i>Of Formal and Physical Astronomy.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">WE</span> have thus rapidly traced
the causes of the almost complete blank which the history of physical
science offers, from the decline of the Roman empire, for a thousand
years. Along with the breaking up of the ancient forms of society,
were broken up the ancient energy of thinking, the clearness of idea,
and steadiness of intellectual action. This mental declension produced
a servile admiration for the genius of the better periods, and thus,
the spirit of Commentation: Christianity established the claim of
truth to govern the world; and this principle, misinterpreted and
combined with the ignorance and servility of the times, gave rise to
the Dogmatic System: and the love of speculation, finding no secure
and permitted path on solid ground, went off into the regions of
Mysticism.</p>
<p>The causes which produced the inertness and blindness of the
stationary period of human knowledge, began at last to yield to the
influence of the principles which tended to progression. The
indistinctness of thought, which was the original feature in the
decline of sound knowledge, was in a measure remedied by the steady
cultivation of Pure Mathematics and Astronomy, and by the progress of
inventions in the Arts, which call out and fix the distinctness of our
conceptions of the relations of natural phenomena. As men’s minds
became clear, they became less servile: the perception of the nature
of truth drew men away from controversies about mere opinion; when
they saw distinctly the relations of <em>things</em>, they ceased to
give their whole attention to what had been <em>said</em> concerning
them; and thus, as science rose into view, the spirit of commentation
lost its way. And when men came to feel what it was to think for
themselves on subjects of science, they soon rebelled against the
right of others to impose opinions upon them. When they threw off
their blind admiration for the ancients, they were disposed to cast
away also their passive obedience to the ancient system of doctrines.
When they were no longer inspired by the spirit of commentation, they
were no longer submissive to the dogmatism of the schools. When they
began to feel that they could <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page256">256</a></span> discover truths, they felt also a
persuasion of a right and a growing will so to do.</p>
<p>Thus the revived clearness of ideas, which made its appearance at
the revival of letters, brought on a struggle with the authority,
intellectual and civil, of the established schools of philosophy. This
clearness of idea showed itself, in the first instance, in Astronomy,
and was embodied in the system of Copernicus; but the contest did not
come to a crisis till a century later, in the time of Galileo and
other disciples of the new doctrine. It is our present business to
trace the principles of this series of events in the history of
philosophy.</p>
<p>I do not profess to write a history of Astronomy, any further than
is necessary in order to exhibit the principles on which the
progression of science proceeds; and, therefore, I neglect subordinate
persons and occurrences, in order to bring into view the leading
features of great changes. Now in the introduction of the Copernican
system into general acceptation, two leading views operated upon men’s
minds; the consideration of the system as exhibiting the apparent
motions of the universe, and the consideration of this system with
reference to its causes;&#8212;the <i>formal</i> and the
<i>physical</i> aspect of the Theory;&#8212;the relations of Space and
Time, and the relations of Force and Matter. These two divisions of
the subject were at first not clearly separated; the second was long
mixed, in a manner very dim and obscure, with the first, without
appearing as a distinct subject of attention; but at last it was
extricated and treated in a manner suitable to its nature. The views
of Copernicus rested mainly on the formal condition of the universe,
the relations of space and time; but Kepler, Galileo, and others, were
led, by controversies and other causes, to give a gradually increasing
attention to the physical relations of the heavenly bodies; an impulse
was given to the study of Mechanics (the Doctrine of Motion), which
became very soon an important and extensive science; and in no long
period, the discoveries of Kepler, suggested by a vague but intense
belief in the physical connection of the parts of the universe, led to
the decisive and sublime generalizations of Newton.</p>
<p>The distinction of <i>formal</i> and <i>physical</i> Astronomy thus
becomes necessary, in order to treat clearly of the discussions which
the propounding of the Copernican theory occasioned. But it may be
observed that, besides this great change, Astronomy made very great
advances in the same path which we have already been tracing, namely,
the determination of the quantities and laws of the celestial motions,
in so far as they were exhibited by the ancient theories, or <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page257">257</a></span> might be represented
by obvious modifications of those theories. I speak of new
Inequalities, new Phenomena, such as Copernicus, Galileo, and Tycho
Brahe discovered. As, however, these were very soon referred to the
Copernican rather than the Ptolemaic hypothesis, they may be
considered as developments rather of the new than of the old Theory;
and I shall, therefore, treat of them, agreeably to the plan of the
former part, as the sequel of the Copernican Induction.</p>
<hr class="three space-above" />
<h3>CHAPTER I.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Prelude to the Inductive Epoch of
Copernicus.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> Doctrine of Copernicus,
that the Sun is the true centre of the celestial motions, depends
primarily upon the consideration that such a supposition explains very
simply and completely all the obvious appearances of the heavens. In
order to see that it does this, nothing more is requisite than a
distinct conception of the nature of Relative Motion, and a knowledge
of the principal Astronomical Phenomena. There was, therefore, no
reason why such a doctrine might not be <em>discovered</em>, that is,
suggested as a theory plausible at first sight, long before the time
of Copernicus; or rather, it was impossible that this guess, among
others, should not be propounded as a solution of the appearances of
the heavens. We are not, therefore, to be surprised if we find, in the
earliest times of Astronomy, and at various succeeding periods, such a
system spoken of by astronomers, and maintained by some as true,
though rejected by the majority, and by the principal writers.</p>
<p>When we look back at such a difference of opinion, having in our
minds, as we unavoidably have, the clear and irresistible
considerations by which the Copernican Doctrine is established <em>for
us</em>, it is difficult for us not to attribute superior sagacity and
candor to those who held that side of the question, and to imagine
those who clung to the Ptolemaic Hypothesis to have been blind and
prejudiced; incapable of seeing the beauty of simplicity and symmetry,
or indisposed to resign established errors, and to accept novel and
comprehensive truths. Yet in judging thus, we are probably ourselves
influenced by prejudices arising from the knowledge and received
opinions of our own times. For is it, in reality, clear that, before
the time of Copernicus, the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page258">258</a></span> <i>Heliocentric</i> Theory (that which
places the centre of the celestial motions in the Sun) had a claim to
assent so decidedly superior to the Geocentric Theory, which places
the Earth in the centre? What is the basis of the heliocentric
theory?&#8212;That the <em>relative</em> motions are <em>the
same</em>, on that and on the other supposition. So far, therefore,
the two hypotheses are exactly on the same footing. But, it is urged,
on the heliocentric side we have the advantage of
simplicity:&#8212;true; but we have, on the other side, the testimony
of our senses; that is, the geocentric doctrine (which asserts that
the Earth rests and the heavenly bodies move) is the obvious and
spontaneous interpretation of the appearances. Both these arguments,
<em>simplicity</em> on the one side, and <em>obviousness</em> on the
other, are vague, and we may venture to say, both indecisive. We
cannot establish any strong preponderance of probability in favor of
the former doctrine, without going much further into the arguments of
the question.</p>
<p>Nor, when we speak of the superior <em>simplicity</em> of the
Copernican theory, must we forget, that though this theory has
undoubtedly, in this respect, a great advantage over the Ptolemaic,
yet that the Copernican system itself is very complex, when it
undertakes to account, as the Ptolemaic did, for the
<em>Inequalities</em> of the Motions of the sun, moon, and planets;
and, that in the hands of Copernicus, it retained a large share of the
eccentrics and epicycles of its predecessor, and, in some parts, with
increased machinery. The heliocentric theory, without these
appendages, would not approach the Ptolemaic, in the accurate
explanation of facts; and as those who had placed the sun in the
centre had never, till the time of Copernicus, shown how the
inequalities were to be explained on that supposition, we may assert
that after the promulgation of the theory of eccentrics and epicycles
on the geocentric hypothesis, there was no <em>published</em>
heliocentric theory which could bear a comparison with that
hypothesis.</p>
<p>It is true, that all the contrivances of epicycles, and the like,
by which the geocentric hypothesis was made to represent the
phenomena, were susceptible of an easy adaptation to a heliocentric
method, <em>when a good mathematician had once proposed to himself the
problem</em>: and this was precisely what Copernicus undertook and
executed. But, till the appearance of his work, the heliocentric
system had never come before the world except as a hasty and imperfect
hypothesis; which bore a favorable comparison with the phenomena, so
long as their general features only were known; but which had been
completely thrown into the shade by the labor and intelligence
bestowed upon <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page259">259</a></span>
the Hipparchian or Ptolemaic theories by a long series of great
astronomers of all civilized countries.</p>
<p>But, though the astronomers who, before Copernicus, held the
heliocentric opinion, cannot, on any good grounds, be considered as
much more enlightened than their opponents, it is curious to trace the
early and repeated manifestations of this view of the universe. The
distinct assertion of the heliocentric theory among the Greeks is an
evidence of the clearness of their thoughts, and the vigour of their
minds; and it is a proof of the feebleness and servility of intellect
in the stationary period, that, till the period of Copernicus, no one
was found to try the fortune of this hypothesis, modified according to
the improved astronomical knowledge of the time.</p>
<p>The most ancient of the Greek philosophers to whom the ancients
ascribe the heliocentric doctrine, is Pythagoras; but Diogenes
Laertius makes Philolaus, one of the followers of Pythagoras, the
first author of this doctrine. We learn from Archimedes, that it was
held by his contemporary, Aristarchus. “Aristarchus of Samos,” says
he,<a id="fnanchor1-5" href="#note1-5"><span
class="fnanchor">1</span></a> “makes this supposition,&#8212;that the
fixed stars and the sun remain at rest, and that the earth revolves
round the sun in a circle.” Plutarch<a id="fnanchor2-5"
href="#note2-5"><span class="fnanchor">2</span></a> asserts that this,
which was only a hypothesis in the hands of Aristarchus, was
<em>proved</em> by Seleucus; but we may venture to say that, at that
time, no such proof was possible. Aristotle had recognized the
existence of this doctrine by arguing against it. “All things,” says
he,<a id="fnanchor3-5" href="#note3-5"><span
class="fnanchor">3</span></a> “tend to the centre of the earth, and
rest there, and therefore the whole mass of the earth cannot rest
except there.” Ptolemy had in like manner argued against the diurnal
motion of the earth: such a revolution would, he urged, disperse into
surrounding space all the loose parts of the earth. Yet he allowed
that such a supposition would facilitate the explanation of some
phenomena. Cicero appears to make Mercury and Venus revolve about the
sun, as does Martianus Capella at a later period; and Seneca says<a
id="fnanchor4-5" href="#note4-5"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a>
it is a worthy subject of contemplation, whether the earth be at rest
or in motion: but at this period, as we may see from Seneca himself,
that habit of intellect which was requisite for the solution of such a
question, had been succeeded by indistinct views, and rhetorical forms
of speech. If there were any good mathematicians and good observers at
this period, they were employed in cultivating and verifying the
Hipparchian theory.</p>

<p>Next to the Greeks, the Indians appear to have possessed that <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page260">260</a></span> original vigor and
clearness of thought, from which true science springs. It is
remarkable that the Indians, also, had their heliocentric theorists.
Aryabatta<a id="fnanchor5-5" href="#note5-5"><span
class="fnanchor">5</span></a> (<span class="sc">a. d.</span> 1322),
and other astronomers of that country, are said to have advocated the
doctrine of the earth’s revolution on its axis; which opinion,
however, was rejected by subsequent philosophers among the
Hindoos.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note5-5"
href="#fnanchor5-5">5</a></span> Lib. U. K. <i>Hist. Ast.</i> p.
11.</div>
<p>Some writers have thought that the heliocentric doctrine was
<em>derived</em> by Pythagoras and other European philosophers, from
some of the oriental nations. This opinion, however, will appear to
have little weight, if we consider that the heliocentric hypothesis,
in the only shape in which the ancients knew it, was too obvious to
require much teaching; that it did not and could not, so far as we
know, receive any additional strength from any thing which the
oriental nations could teach; and that each astronomer was induced to
adopt or reject it, not by any information which a master could give
him, but by his love of geometrical simplicity on the one hand, or the
prejudices of sense on the other. Real science, depending on a clear
view of the relation of phenomena to general theoretical ideas, cannot
be communicated in the way of secret and exclusive traditions, like
the mysteries of certain arts and crafts. If the philosopher do not
<em>see</em> that the theory is true, he is little the better for
having heard or read the words which assert its truth.</p>
<p>It is impossible, therefore, for us to assent to those views which
would discover in the heliocentric doctrines of the ancients, traces
of a more profound astronomy than any which they have transmitted to
us. Those doctrines were merely the plausible conjectures of men with
sound geometrical notions; but they were never extended so as to
embrace the details of the existing astronomical knowledge; and
perhaps we may say, that the analysis of the phenomena into the
arrangements of the Ptolemaic system, was so much more obvious than
any other, that it must necessarily come first, in order to form an
introduction to the Copernican.</p>
<p>The true foundation of the heliocentric theory for the ancients
was, as we have intimated, its perfect geometrical consistency with
the general features of the phenomena, and its simplicity. But it was
unlikely that the human mind would be content to consider the subject
under this strict and limited aspect alone. In its eagerness for wide
speculative views, it naturally looked out for other and vaguer
principles of connection and relation. Thus, as it had been urged in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page261">261</a></span> favor of the
geocentric doctrine, that the heaviest body must be in the centre, it
was maintained, as a leading recommendation of the opposite opinion,
that it placed the Fire, the noblest element, in the Centre of the
Universe. The authority of mythological ideas was called in on both
sides to support these views. Numa, as Plutarch<a id="fnanchor6-5"
href="#note6-5"><span class="fnanchor">6</span></a> informs us, built
a circular temple over the ever-burning Fire of Vesta; typifying, not
the earth, but the Universe, which, according to the Pythagoreans, has
the Fire seated at its Centre. The same writer, in another of his
works, makes one of his interlocutors say, “Only, my friend, do not
bring me before a court of law on a charge of impiety; as Cleanthes
said, that Aristarchus the Samian ought to be tried for impiety,
because he removed the Hearth of the Universe.” This, however, seems
to have been intended as a pleasantry.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note6-5"
href="#fnanchor6-5">6</a></span> <i>De Facie in Orbe Lunæ</i>,
6.</div>
<p>The prevalent physical views, and the opinions concerning the
causes of the motions of the parts of the universe, were scarcely more
definite than the ancient opinions concerning the relations of the
four elements, till Galileo had founded the true Doctrine of Motion.
Though, therefore, arguments on this part of the subject were the most
important part of the controversy after Copernicus, the force of such
arguments was at his time almost balanced. Even if more had been known
on such subjects, the arguments would not have been conclusive: for
instance, the vast mass of the heavens, which is commonly urged as a
reason why the heavens do not move round the earth, would not make
such a motion impossible; and, on the other hand, the motions of
bodies at the earth’s surface, which were alleged as inconsistent with
its motion, did not really disprove such an opinion. But according to
the state of the science of motion before Copernicus, all reasonings
from such principles were utterly vague and obscure.</p>
<p>We must not omit to mention a modern who preceded Copernicus, in
the assertion at least of the heliocentric doctrine. This was Nicholas
of Cusa (a village near Treves), a cardinal and bishop, who, in the
first half of the fifteenth century, was very eminent as a divine and
mathematician; and who in a work, <i>De Doctâ Ignorantiâ</i>,
propounded the doctrine of the motion of the earth; more, however, as
a paradox than as a reality. We cannot consider this as any distinct
anticipation of a profound and consistent view of the truth.</p>
<p>We shall now examine further the promulgation of the Heliocentric
System by Copernicus, and its consequences.  ~Additional material in
the <a href="#v1page523">3rd edition</a>.~ <span class="pagenum"><a

<h3 class="space-above">CHAPTER II.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Induction of Copernicus.&#8212;The Heliocentric
Theory asserted on formal grounds.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IT</span> will be recollected that
the <i>formal</i> are opposed to the <i>physical</i> grounds of a
theory; the former term indicating that it gives a satisfactory
account of the relations of the phenomena in Space and Time, that is,
of the Motions themselves; while the latter expression implies further
that we include in our explanation the Causes of the motions, the laws
of Force and Matter. The strongest of the considerations by which
Copernicus was led to invent and adopt his system of the universe were
of the former kind. He was dissatisfied, he says, in his Preface
addressed to the Pope, with the want of symmetry in the Eccentric
Theory, as it prevailed in his days; and weary of the uncertainty of
the mathematical traditions. He then sought through all the works of
philosophers, whether any had held opinions concerning the motions of
the world, different from those received in the established
mathematical schools. He found, in ancient authors, accounts of
Philolaus and others, who had asserted the motion of the earth.
“Then,” he adds, “I, too, began to meditate concerning the motion of
the earth; and though it appeared an absurd opinion, yet since I knew
that, in previous times, others had been allowed the privilege of
feigning what circles they chose, in order to explain the phenomena, I
conceived that I also might take the liberty of trying whether, on the
supposition of the earth’s motion, it was possible to find better
explanations than the ancient ones, of the revolutions of the
celestial orbs.</p>
<p>“Having then assumed the motions of the earth, which are hereafter
explained, by laborious and long observation I at length found, that
if the motions of the other planets be compared with the revolution of
the earth, not only their phenomena follow from the suppositions, but
also that the several orbs, and the whole system, are so connected in
order and magnitude, that no one part can be transposed without
disturbing the rest, and introducing confusion into the whole
universe.”</p>
<p>Thus the satisfactory explanation of the apparent motions of the
planets, and the simplicity and symmetry of the system, were the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page263">263</a></span> grounds on which
Copernicus adopted his theory; as the craving for these qualities was
the feeling which led him to seek for a new theory. It is manifest
that in this, as in other cases of discovery, a clear and steady
possession of abstract Ideas, and an aptitude in comprehending real
Facts under these general conceptions, must have been leading
characters in the discoverer’s mind. He must have had a good
geometrical head, and great astronomical knowledge. He must have seen,
with peculiar distinctness, the consequences which flowed from his
suppositions as to the relations of space and time,&#8212;the apparent
motions which resulted from the assumed real ones; and he must also
have known well all the irregularities of the apparent motions for
which he had to account. We find indications of these qualities in his
expressions. A steady and calm contemplation of the theory is what he
asks for, as the main requisite to its reception. If you suppose the
earth to revolve and the heaven to be at rest, you will find, he says,
“<i>si serio animadvertas</i>,” if you think steadily, that the
apparent diurnal motion will follow. And after alleging his reasons
for his system, he says,<a id="fnanchor7-5" href="#note7-5"><span
class="fnanchor">7</span></a> “We are, therefore, not ashamed to
confess, that the whole of the space within the orbit of the moon,
along with the centre of the earth, moves round the sun in a year
among the other planets; the magnitude of the world being so great,
that the distance of the earth from the sun has no apparent magnitude
when compared with the sphere of the fixed stars.” “All which things,
though they be difficult and almost inconceivable, and against the
opinion of the majority, yet, in the sequel, by God’s favor, we will
make clearer than the sun, at least to those who are not ignorant of
mathematics.”</p>

class="sc">m.d.xliii</span>. p. 9.</div>
<p>It will easily be understood, that since the ancient geocentric
hypothesis ascribed to the planets those motions which were apparent
only, and which really arose from the motion of the earth round the
sun in the new hypothesis, the latter scheme must much simplify the
planetary theory. Kepler<a id="fnanchor8-5" href="#note8-5"><span
class="fnanchor">8</span></a> enumerates eleven motions of the
Ptolemaic system, which are at once exterminated and rendered
unnecessary by the new system. Still, as the real motions, both of the
earth and the planets, are unequable, it was requisite to have some
mode of representing their inequalities; and, accordingly, the ancient
theory of eccentrics and epicycles was retained, so far as was
requisite for this purpose. The planets revolved round the sun by
means of a Deferent, and a <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page264">264</a></span> great and small Epicycle; or else by
means of an Eccentric and Epicycle, modified from Ptolemy’s, for
reasons which we shall shortly mention. This mode of representing the
motions of the planets continued in use, until it was expelled by the
discoveries of Kepler.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note8-5"
href="#fnanchor8-5">8</a></span> <i>Myst. Cosm.</i> cap. 1.</div>
<p>Besides the daily rotation of the earth on its axis, and its annual
circuit about the sun, Copernicus attributed to the axis a “motion of
declination,” by which, during the whole annual revolution, the pole
was constantly directed towards the same part of the heavens. This
constancy in the absolute direction of the axis, or its moving
parallel to itself, may be more correctly viewed as not indicating any
separate motion. The axis continues in the same direction, because
there is nothing to make it change its direction; just as a straw,
lying on the surface of a cup of water, continues to point nearly in
the same direction when the cup is carried round a room. And this was
noticed by Copernicus’s adherent, Rothman,<a id="fnanchor9-5"
href="#note9-5"><span class="fnanchor">9</span></a> a few years after
the publication of the work <i>De Revolutionibus</i>. “There is no
occasion,” he says, in a letter to Tycho Brahe, “for the triple motion
of the earth: the annual and diurnal motions suffice.” This error of
Copernicus, if it be looked upon as an error, arose from his referring
the position of the axis to a limited space, which he conceived to be
carried round the sun along with the earth, instead of referring it to
fixed or absolute space. When, in a Planetarium (a machine in which
the motions of the planets are imitated), the earth is carried round
the sun by being fastened to a material radius, it is requisite to
give a motion to the axis by <em>additional</em> machinery, in order
to enable it to <em>preserve</em> its parallelism. A similar confusion
of geometrical conception, produced by a double reference to absolute
space and to the centre of revolution, often leads persons to dispute
whether the moon, which revolves about the earth, always turning to it
the same face, revolves about her axis or not.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note9-5"
href="#fnanchor9-5">9</a></span> Tycho. Epist. i. p. 184, <span
class="sc">a. d.</span> 1590.</div>
<p>It is also to be noticed that the precession of the equinoxes made
it necessary to suppose the axis of the earth to be not
<em>exactly</em> parallel to itself, but to deviate from that position
by a slight annual difference. Copernicus erroneously supposes the
precession to be unequable; and his method of explaining this change,
which is simpler than that of the ancients, becomes more simple still,
when applied to the true state of the facts.</p>
<p>The tendencies of our speculative nature, which carry us onwards in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page265">265</a></span> pursuit of
symmetry and rule, and which thus produced the theory of Copernicus,
as they produce all theories, perpetually show their vigor by
overshooting their mark. They obtain something by aiming at much more.
They detect the order and connection which exist, by imagining
relations of order and connection which have no existence. Real
discoveries are thus mixed with baseless assumptions; profound
sagacity is combined with fanciful conjecture; not rarely, or in
peculiar instances, but commonly, and in most cases; probably in all,
if we could read the thoughts of the discoverers as we read the books
of Kepler. To try wrong guesses is apparently the only way to hit upon
right ones. The character of the true philosopher is, not that he
never conjectures hazardously, but that his conjectures are clearly
conceived and brought into rigid contact with facts. He sees and
compares distinctly the ideas and the things,&#8212;the relations of
his notions to each other and to phenomena. Under these conditions it
is not only excusable, but necessary for him, to snatch at every
semblance of general rule;&#8212;to try all promising forms of
simplicity and symmetry.</p>
<p>Copernicus is not exempt from giving us, in his work, an example of
this character of the inventive spirit. The axiom that the celestial
motions must be <i>circular</i> and <i>uniform</i>, appeared to him to
have strong claims to acceptation; and his theory of the inequalities
of the planetary motions is fashioned upon it. His great desire was to
apply it more rigidly than Ptolemy had done. The time did not come for
rejecting this axiom, till the observations of Tycho Brahe and the
calculations of Kepler had been made.</p>
<p>I shall not attempt to explain, in detail, Copernicus’s system of
the planetary inequalities. He retained epicycles and eccentrics,
altering their centres of motion; that is, he retained what was
<em>true</em> in the old system, <em>translating</em> it into his own.
The peculiarities of his method consisted in making such a combination
of epicycles as to supply the place of the <i>equant</i>,<a
id="fnanchor10-5" href="#note10-5"><span
class="fnanchor">10</span></a> and to make all the motions equable
about the centres of motion. This device was admired for a time, till
Kepler’s elliptic theory expelled it, with all other forms of the
theory of epicycles: but we must observe that Copernicus was aware of
some of the discrepancies which belonged to that theory as it had, up
to that time, been propounded. In the case of Mercury’s orbit, which
is more eccentric than that of the other planets, he makes
suppositions which are complex indeed, but which show his perception
of the imperfection of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page266">266</a></span> the common theory; and he proposes a new
theory of the moon, for the very reason which did at last overturn the
doctrine of epicycles, namely, that the ratio of their distances from
the earth at different times was inconsistent with the circular
hypothesis.<a id="fnanchor11-5" href="#note11-5"><span

<p>It is obvious, that, along with his mathematical clearness of view,
and his astronomical knowledge, Copernicus must have had great
intellectual boldness and vigor, to conceive and fully develop a
theory so different as his was from all received doctrines. His pupil
and expositor, Rheticus, says to Schener, “I beg you to have this
opinion concerning that learned man, my Preceptor; that he was an
ardent admirer and follower of Ptolemy; but when he was compelled by
phenomena and demonstration, he thought he did well to aim at the same
mark at which Ptolemy had aimed, though with a bow and shafts of a
very different material from his. We must recollect what Ptolemy says,
Δεῖ δ’ ἐλευθέρον εἶναι τῇ γνώμῃ τὸν μέλλοντα φιλοσοφεῖν. ‘He who is to
follow philosophy must be a freeman in mind.’” Rheticus then goes on
to defend his master from the charge of disrespect to the ancients:
“That temper,” he says, “is alien from the disposition of every good
man, and most especially from the spirit of philosophy, and from no
one more utterly than from my Preceptor. He was very far from rashly
rejecting the opinions of ancient philosophers, except for weighty
reasons and irresistible facts, through any love of novelty. His
years, his gravity of character, his excellent learning, his
magnanimity and nobleness of spirit, are very far from having any
liability to such a temper, which belongs either to youth, or to
ardent and light minds, or to those τῶν μέγα φρονούντων ἐπὶ θεωρίᾳ
μικρῂ, ‘who think much of themselves and know little,’ as Aristotle
says.” Undoubtedly this deference for the great men of the past,
joined with the talent of seizing the spirit of their methods when the
letter of their theories is no longer tenable, <em>is</em> the true
mental constitution of discoverers.</p>
<p>Besides the intellectual energy which was requisite in order to
construct a system of doctrines so novel as those of Copernicus, some
courage was necessary to the publication of such opinions; certain, as
they were, to be met, to a great extent, by rejection and dispute, and
perhaps by charges of heresy and mischievous tendency. This last
danger, however, must not be judged so great as we might infer from
the angry controversies and acts of authority which occurred in <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page267">267</a></span> Galileo’s time. The
Dogmatism of the stationary period, which identified the cause of
philosophical and religious truth, had not yet distinctly felt itself
attacked by the advance of physical knowledge; and therefore had not
begun to look with alarm on such movements. Still, the claims of
Scripture and of ecclesiastical authority were asserted as paramount
on all subjects; and it was obvious that many persons would be
disquieted or offended with the new interpretation of many scriptural
expressions, which the true theory would make necessary. This evil
Copernicus appears to have foreseen; and this and other causes long
withheld him from publication. He was himself an ecclesiastic; and, by
the patronage of his maternal uncle, was prebendary of the church of
St. John at Thorn, and a canon of the church of Frauenburg, in the
diocese of Ermeland.<a id="fnanchor12-5" href="#note12-5"><span
class="fnanchor">12</span></a> He had been a student at Bologna, and
had taught mathematics at Rome in the year 1500; and he afterwards
pursued his studies and observations at his residence near the mouth
of the Vistula.<a id="fnanchor13-5" href="#note13-5"><span
class="fnanchor">13</span></a> His discovery of his system must have
occurred before 1507, for in 1543 he informs Pope Paulus the Third, in
his dedication, that he had kept his book by him for four times the
nine years recommended by Horace, and then only published it at the
earnest entreaty of his friend Cardinal Schomberg, whose letter is
prefixed to the work. “Though I know,” he says, “that the thoughts of
a philosopher do not depend on the judgment of the many, his study
being to seek out truth in all things as far as that is permitted by
God to human reason: yet when I considered,” he adds, “how absurd my
doctrine would appear, I long hesitated whether I should publish my
book, or whether it were not better to follow the example of the
Pythagoreans and others, who delivered their doctrines only by
tradition and to friends.” It will be observed that he speaks here of
the opposition of the established school of Astronomers, not of
Divines. The latter, indeed, he appears to consider as a less
formidable danger. “If perchance,” he says at the end of his preface,
“there be ματαιολόγοι, vain babblers, who knowing nothing of
mathematics, yet assume the right of judging on account of some place
of Scripture perversely wrested to their purpose, and who blame and
attack my undertaking; I heed them not, and look upon their judgments
as rash and contemptible.” He then goes on to show that the globular
figure of the earth (which was, of course, at that time, an undisputed
point among astronomers), had been opposed on similar grounds by
Lactantius, who, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page268">268</a></span> though a writer of credit in other
respects, had spoken very childishly in that matter. In another
epistle prefixed to the work (by Andreas Osiander), the reader is
reminded that the hypotheses of astronomers are not necessarily
asserted to be true, by those who propose them, but only to be a way
of <em>representing</em> facts. We may observe that, in the time of
Copernicus, when the motion of the earth had not been connected with
the physical laws of matter and motion, it could not be considered so
distinctly real as it necessarily was held to be in after times.</p>

<p>The delay of the publication of Copernicus’s work brought it to the
end of his life; he died in the year 1543, in which it was published.
It was entitled <i>De Revolutionibus Orbium Cœlestium Libri VI</i>. He
received the only copy he ever saw on the day of his death, and never
opened it: he had then, says Gassendi, his biographer, other cares.
His system was, however, to a certain extent, promulgated, and his
fame diffused before that time. Cardinal Schomberg, in his letter of
1536, which has been already mentioned, says, “Some years ago, when I
heard tidings of your merit by the constant report of all persons, my
affection for you was augmented, and I congratulated the men of our
time, among whom you flourish in so much honor. For I had understood
that you were not only acquainted with the discoveries of ancient
mathematicians, but also had formed a new system of the world, in
which you teach that the Earth moves, the Sun occupies the lowest, and
consequently, the middle place, the sphere of the fixed stars remains
immovable and fixed, and the Moon, along with the elements included in
her sphere, placed between the orbits (<i>cœlum</i>) of Mars and
Venus, travels round the sun in a yearly
revolution.”<a id="fnanchor14-5" href="#note14-5"><span class="fnanchor">14</span></a>
The writer goes on to say that he has
heard that Copernicus has written a book (<i>Commentarios</i>), in
which this system is applied to the construction of Tables of the
Planetary Motions (<i>erraticarum stellarum</i>). He then proceeds to
entreat him earnestly to publish his lucubrations.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note14-5"
href="#fnanchor14-5">14</a></span> This passage has so important a
place in the history, that I will give it in the
original:&#8212;“Intellexeram te non modo veterum mathematicorum
inventa egregie callere sed etiam novam mundi rationem constituisse:
Qua doceas terram moveri: solem imum mundi, atque medium locum
obtinere: cœlum octavum immotum atque fixum perpetuo manere: Lunam se
una cum inclusis suæ spheræ elementis, inter Martis et Veneris cœlum
sitam, anniversario cursu circum solem convertere. Atque de hac tota
astronomiæ ratione commentarios a te confectos esse, ac erraticarum
stellarum motus calculis subductos tabulis te contulisse, maxima
omnium cum admiratione. Quamobrem vir doctissime, nisi tibi molestus
sum, te etiam atque etiam oro vehementer ut hoc tuum inventum
studiosis communices, et tuas de mundi sphæra lucubrationes, una cum
Tabulis et si quid habes præterea quod ad eandem rem pertineat primo
quoque tempore ad me mittas.”</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page269">269</a></span> This letter
is dated 1536, and implies that the work of Copernicus was then
written, and known to persons who studied astronomy. Delambre says
that Achilles Gassarus of Lindau, in a letter dated 1540, sends to his
friend George Vogelin of Constance, the book <i>De Revolutionibus</i>.
But Mr. De Morgan<a id="fnanchor15-5" href="#note15-5"><span
class="fnanchor">15</span></a> has pointed out that the printed work
which Gassarus sent to Vogelin was the <i>Narratio</i> by Rheticus of
Feldkirch, a eulogium of Copernicus and his system prefixed to the
second edition of the <i>De Revolutionibus</i>, which appeared in
1566. In this Narration, Rheticus speaks of the work of Copernicus as
a Palingenesia, or New Birth of astronomy. Rheticus, it appears, had
gone to Copernicus for the purpose of getting knowledge about
triangles and trigonometrical tables, and had had his attention called
to the heliocentric theory, of which he became an ardent admirer. He
speaks of his “Preceptor” with strong admiration, as we have seen. “He
appears to me,” says he, “more to resemble Ptolemy than any other
astronomers.” This, it must be recollected, was selecting the highest
known subject of comparison.  ~Additional material in the <a

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Sequel to Copernicus.&#8212;The Reception and
Development of the Copernican Theory.</span></h3>
<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>First Reception of the
Copernican Theory.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> theories of Copernicus
made their way among astronomers, in the manner in which true
astronomical theories always obtain the assent of competent judges.
They led to the construction of Tables of the motion of the sun, moon,
and planets, as the theories of Hipparchus and Ptolemy had done; and
the verification of the doctrines was to be looked for, from the
agreement of these Tables with observation, through a sufficient
course of time. The work <i>De Revolutionibus</i> contains such
Tables. In 1551 Reinhold improved and republished Tables founded on
the principles of Copernicus. “We owe,” he says in his preface, “great
obligations to Copernicus, both for his laborious <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page270">270</a></span> observations, and for
restoring the doctrine of the Motions. But though his geometry is
perfect, the good old man appears to have been, at times, careless in
his numerical calculations. I have, therefore, recalculated the whole,
from a comparison of his observations with those of Ptolemy and
others, following nothing but the general plan of Copernicus’s
demonstrations.” These “Prutenic Tables” were republished in 1571 and
1585, and continued in repute for some time; till superseded by the
Rudolphine Tables of Kepler in 1627. The name <i>Prutenic</i>, or
Prussian, was employed by the author as a mark of gratitude to his
benefactor Albert, Markgrave of Brandenbourg. The discoveries of
Copernicus had inspired neighboring nations with the ambition of
claiming a place in the literary community of Europe. In something of
the same spirit, Rheticus wrote an <i>Encomium Borussiæ</i>, which was
published along with his <i>Narratio</i>.</p>
<p>The Tables founded upon the Copernican system were, at first, much
more generally adopted than the heliocentric doctrine on which they
were founded. Thus Magini published at Venice, in 1587, <i>New
Theories of the Celestial Orbits, agreeing with the Observations of
Nicholas Copernicus</i>. But in the preface, after praising
Copernicus, he says, “Since, however, he, either for the sake of
showing his talents, or induced by his own reasons, has revived the
opinion of Nicetas, Aristarchus, and others, concerning the motion of
the earth, and has disturbed the established constitution of the
world, which was a reason why many rejected, or received with dislike,
his hypothesis, I have thought it worth while, that, rejecting the
suppositions of Copernicus, I should accommodate other causes to his
observations, and to the Prutenic Tables.”</p>
<p>This doctrine, however, was, as we have shown, received with favor
by many persons, even before its general publication. The doctrine of
the motion of the earth was first publicly maintained at Rome by
Widmanstadt,<a id="fnanchor16-5" href="#note16-5"><span
class="fnanchor">16</span></a> who professed to have received it from
Copernicus, and explained the System before the Pope and the
Cardinals, but did not teach it to the public.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note16-5"
href="#fnanchor16-5">16</a></span>  See Venturi, <i>Essai sur les
Ouvrages Physico-Mathématiques de Leonard da Vinci, avec des Fragmens
tirés de ses Manuscrits apportés d’Italie</i>. Paris, 1797; and, as
there quoted, <i>Marini Archiatri Pontificii</i>, tom. ii. p.
251.</div>
<p>Leonardo da Vinci, who was an eminent mathematician, as well as
painter, about 1510, explained how a body, by describing a kind of
spiral, might descend towards a revolving globe, so that its apparent
motion relative to a point in the surface of the globe, might be in a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page271">271</a></span> straight line
leading to the centre. He thus showed that he had entertained in his
thoughts the hypothesis of the earth’s rotation, and was employed in
removing the difficulties which accompanied this supposition, by means
of the consideration of the composition of motions.</p>
<p>In like manner we find the question stirred by other eminent men.
Thus John Muller of Konigsberg, a celebrated astronomer who died in
1476, better known by the name of Regiomontanus, wrote a dissertation
on the subject “Whether the earth be in motion or at rest,” in which
he decides <i>ex professo</i><a id="fnanchor17-5"
href="#note17-5"><span class="fnanchor">17</span></a> against the
motion. Yet such discussions must have made generally known the
arguments for the heliocentric theory.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note17-5"
href="#fnanchor17-5">17</a></span> Schoneri <i>Opera</i>, part ii. p.
129.</div>
<p>We have already seen the enthusiasm with which Rheticus, who was
Copernicus’s pupil in the latter years of his life, speaks of him.
“Thus,” says he, “God has given to my excellent preceptor a reign
without end; which may He vouchsafe to guide, govern, and increase, to
the restoration of astronomical truth. Amen.”</p>
<p>Of the immediate converts of the Copernican system, who adopted it
before the controversy on the subject had attracted attention, I shall
only add <span class="correction" title="emended from
Mastlin">Mæstlin</span>, and his pupil, Kepler. <span
class="correction" title="emended from Mastlin">Mæstlin</span>
published in 1588 an <i>Epitome Astronomiæ</i>, in which the
immobility of the earth is asserted; but in 1596 he edited Kepler’s
<i>Mysterium Cosmographicum</i>, and the <i>Narratio</i> of Rheticus:
and in an epistle of his own, which he inserts, he defends the
Copernican system by those physical reasonings which we shall shortly
have to mention, as the usual arguments in this dispute. Kepler
himself, in the outset of the work just named, says, “When I was at
Tübingen, attending to Michael Mæstlin, being disturbed by the
manifold inconveniences of the usual opinion concerning the world, I
was so delighted with Copernicus, of whom he made great mention in his
lectures, that I not only defended his opinions in our disputations of
the candidates, but wrote a thesis concerning the First Motion which
is produced by the revolution of the earth.” This must have been in
1590.</p>
<p>The differences of opinion respecting the Copernican system, of
which we thus see traces, led to a controversy of some length and
extent. This controversy turned principally upon physical
considerations, which were much more distinctly dealt with by Kepler,
and others of the followers of Copernicus, than they had been by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page272">272</a></span> discoverer
himself. I shall, therefore, give a separate consideration to this
part of the subject. It may be proper, however, in the first place, to
make a few observations on the progress of the doctrine, independently
of these physical speculations.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Diffusion of the Copernican
Theory.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> diffusion of the Copernican opinions in
the world did not take place rapidly at first. Indeed, it was
necessarily some time before the progress of observation and of
theoretical mechanics gave the heliocentric doctrine that superiority
in argument, which now makes us wonder that men should have hesitated
when it was presented to them. Yet there were some speculators of this
kind, who were attracted at once by the enlarged views of the universe
which it opened to them. Among these was the unfortunate Giordano
Bruno of Nola, who was burnt as a heretic at Rome in 1600. The
heresies which led to his unhappy fate were, however, not his
astronomical opinions, but a work which he published in England, and
dedicated to Sir Philip Sydney, under the title of <i>Spaccio della
Bestia Trionfante</i>, and which is understood to contain a bitter
satire of religion and the papal government. Montucla conceives that,
by his rashness in visiting Italy after putting forth such a work, he
compelled the government to act against him. Bruno embraced the
Copernican opinions at an early period, and connected with them the
belief in innumerable worlds besides that which we inhabit; as also
certain metaphysical or theological doctrines which he called the
Nolan philosophy. In 1591 he published <i>De innumerabilibus, immenso,
et infigurabili, seu de Universo et Mundis</i>, in which he maintains
that each star is a sun, about which revolve planets like our earth;
but this opinion is mixed up with a large mass of baseless verbal
speculations.</p>
<p>Giordano Bruno is a disciple of Copernicus on whom we may look with
peculiar interest, since he probably had a considerable share in
introducing the new opinions into England;<a id="fnanchor18-5"
href="#note18-5"><span class="fnanchor">18</span></a> although other
persons, as Recorde, Field, Dee, had adopted it nearly thirty years
earlier; and Thomas Digges ten years before, much more expressly.
Bruno visited this country in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and speaks
of her and of her councillors in terms of praise, which appear to show
that <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page273">273</a></span> his book
was intended for English readers; though he describes the mob which
was usually to be met with in the streets of London with expressions
of great disgust: “Una plebe la quale in essere irrespettevole,
incivile, rozza, rustica, selvatica, et male allevata, non cede ad
altra che pascer possa la terra nel suo seno.”<a id="fnanchor19-5"
href="#note19-5"><span class="fnanchor">19</span></a> The work to
which I refer is <i>La Cena de le Cenere</i>, and narrates what took
place at a supper held on the evening of Ash Wednesday (about 1583,
see p. 145 of the book), at the house of Sir Fulk Greville, in order
to give “Il Nolano” an opportunity of defending his peculiar opinions.
His principal antagonists are two “Dottori d’ Oxonia,” whom Bruno
calls Nundinio and Torquato. The subject is not treated in any very
masterly manner on either side; but the author makes himself have
greatly the advantage not only in argument, but in temper and
courtesy: and in support of his representations of “pedantesca,
ostinatissima ignoranza et presunzione, mista con una rustica
incivilità, che farebbe prevaricar la pazienza di Giobbe,” in his
opponents, he refers to a public disputation which he had held at
Oxford with these doctors of theology, in presence of Prince Alasco,
and many of the English nobility.<a id="fnanchor20-5"

<p>Among the evidences of the difficulties which still lay in the way
of the reception of the Copernican system, we may notice Bacon, who,
as is well known, never gave a full assent to it. It is to be
observed, however, that he does not reject the opinion of the earth’s
motion in so peremptory and dogmatical a manner as he is sometimes
accused of doing: thus in the <i>Thema Cœli</i> he says, “The earth,
then, being supposed to be at rest (for that now appears to us the
<em>more true</em> opinion).” And in his tract <i>On the Cause of the
Tides</i>, he says, “If the tide of the sea be the extreme and
diminished limit of the diurnal motion of the heavens, it will follow
that the earth is immovable; or at least that it moves with a much
slower motion than the water.” In the <i>Descriptio Globi
Intellectualis</i> he gives his reasons for not accepting the
heliocentric theory. “In the system of Copernicus there are many and
grave difficulties: for the threefold motion with which he encumbers
the earth is a serious inconvenience; and the separation of the sun
from the planets, with which he has so many affections in common, is
likewise a harsh step; and the introduction of so many immovable
bodies into nature, as when he makes the sun and the stars immovable,
the bodies which are peculiarly lucid and radiant; and his making the
moon adhere to the earth in a sort of epicycle; and some <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page274">274</a></span> other things which he
assumes, are proceedings which mark a man who thinks nothing of
introducing fictions of any kind into nature, provided his
calculations turn out well.” We have already explained that, in
attributing <em>three</em> motions to the earth, Copernicus had
presented his system encumbered with a complexity not really belonging
to it. But it will be seen shortly, that Bacon’s fundamental objection
to this system was his wish for a system which could be supported by
sound physical considerations; and it must be allowed, that at the
period of which we are speaking, this had not yet been done in favor
of the Copernican hypothesis. We may add, however, that it is not
quite clear that Bacon was in full possession of the details of the
astronomical systems which that of Copernicus was intended to
supersede; and that thus he, perhaps, did not see how much less harsh
were these fictions, as he called them, than those which were the
inevitable alternatives. Perhaps he might even be liable to a little
of that indistinctness, with respect to strictly geometrical
conceptions, which we have remarked in Aristotle. We can hardly
otherwise account for his not seeing any use in resolving the
apparently irregular motion of a planet into separate regular motions.
Yet he speaks slightingly of this important step.<a id="fnanchor21-5"
href="#note21-5"><span class="fnanchor">21</span></a> “The motion of
planets, which is constantly talked of as the motion of regression, or
renitency, from west to east, and which is ascribed to the planets as
a proper motion, is not true; but only arises from appearance, from
the greater advance of the starry heavens towards the west, by which
the planets are left behind to the east.” Undoubtedly those who spoke
of such a motion of <i>regression</i> were aware of this; but they saw
how the motion was simplified by this way of conceiving it, which
Bacon seems not to have seen. Though, therefore, we may admire Bacon
for the steadfastness with which he looked forward to physical
astronomy as the great and proper object of philosophical interest, we
cannot give him credit for seeing the full value and meaning of what
had been done, up to his time, in Formal Astronomy.</p>

<p>Bacon’s contemporary, Gilbert, whom he frequently praises as a
philosopher, was much more disposed to adopt the Copernican opinions,
though even he does not appear to have made up his mind to assent to
the whole of the system. In his work. <i>De Magnete</i> (printed
1600), he gives the principal arguments in favor of the Copernican
system, and decides that the earth revolves on its axis.<a
id="fnanchor22-5" href="#note22-5"><span
class="fnanchor">22</span></a> He connects <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page275">275</a></span> this opinion with his magnetic
doctrines; and especially endeavors by that means to account for the
precession of the equinoxes. But he does not seem to have been equally
confident of its annual motion. In a posthumous work, published in
1661 (<i>De Mundo Nostra Sublunari Philosophia Nova</i>) he appears to
hesitate between the systems of Tycho and Copernicus.<a
id="fnanchor23-5" href="#note23-5"><span
class="fnanchor">23</span></a> Indeed, it is probable that at this
period many persons were in a state of doubt on such subjects. Milton,
at a period somewhat later, appears to have been still undecided. In
the opening of the eighth book of the <i>Paradise Lost</i>, he makes
Adam state the difficulties of the Ptolemaic hypothesis, to which the
archangel Raphael opposes the usual answers; but afterwards suggests
to his pupil the newer system:</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>Milton’s leaning, however, seems to have been for the new system;
we can hardly believe that he would otherwise have conceived so
distinctly, and described with such obvious pleasure, the motion of
the earth:</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>Perhaps the works of the celebrated Bishop Wilkins tended more than
any others to the diffusion of the Copernican system in England, since
even their extravagances drew a stronger attention to them. In 1638,
when he was only twenty-four years old, he published a book entitled
<i>The Discovery of a New World; or a Discourse tending to prove that
it is probable there may be another habitable World in the Moon; with
a Discourse concerning</i> the possibility of a passage thither. The
latter part of his subject was, of course, an obvious mark for the
sneers and witticisms of critics. Two years afterwards, in 1640,
appeared his <i>Discourse concerning a new Planet; tending to prove
that it is probable our Earth is one of the Planets</i>: in which he
urged the reasons in favor of the heliocentric system; and explained
away the opposite arguments, especially those drawn from the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page276">276</a></span> supposed declarations
of Scripture. Probably a good deal was done for the establishment of
those opinions by Thomas Salusbury, who was a warm admirer of Galileo,
and published, in 1661, a translation of several of his works bearing
upon this subject. The mathematicians of this country, in the
seventeenth century, as Napier and Briggs, Horrox and Crabtree,
Oughtred and Seth Ward, Wallis and Wren, were probably all decided
Copernicans. Kepler dedicates one of his works to Napier, and Ward
invented an approximate method of solving Kepler’s problem, still
known as “the simple elliptical hypothesis.” Horrox wrote, and wrote
well, in defence of the Copernican opinion, in his <i>Keplerian
Astronomy defended and promoted</i>, composed (in Latin) probably
about 1635, but not published till 1673, the author having died at the
age of twenty-two, and his papers having been lost. But Salusbury’s
work was calculated for another circle of readers. “The book,” he says
in the introductory address, “being, for subject and design, intended
chiefly for gentlemen, I have been as careless of using a studied
pedantry in my style, as careful in contriving a pleasant and
beautiful impression.” In order, however, to judge of the advantage
under which the Copernican system now came forward, we must consider
the additional evidence for it which was brought to light by Galileo’s
astronomical discoveries.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>The Heliocentric Theory confirmed by
Facts.&#8212;Galileo’s Astronomical Discoveries.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> long interval which elapsed between the
last great discoveries made by the ancients and the first made by the
moderns, had afforded ample time for the development of all the
important consequences of the ancient doctrines. But when the human
mind had been thoroughly roused again into activity, this was no
longer the course of events. Discoveries crowded on each other; one
wide field of speculation was only just opened, when a richer promise
tempted the laborers away into another quarter. Hence the history of
this period contains the beginnings of many sciences, but exhibits
none fully worked out into a complete or final form. Thus the science
of Statics, soon after its revival, was eclipsed and overlaid by that
of Dynamics; and the Copernican system, considered merely with
reference to the views of its author, was absorbed in the commanding
interest of Physical Astronomy.</p>
<p>Still, advances were made which had an important bearing on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page277">277</a></span> heliocentric
theory, in other ways than by throwing light upon its physical
principles. I speak of the new views of the heavens which the
Telescope gave; the visible inequalities of the moon’s surface; the
moon-like phases of the planet Venus; the discovery of the Satellites
of Jupiter, and of the Ring of Saturn. These discoveries excited at
the time the strongest interest; both from the novelty and beauty of
the objects they presented to the sense; from the way in which they
seemed to gratify man’s curiosity with regard to the remote parts of
the universe; and also from that of which we have here to speak, their
bearing upon the conflict of the old and the new philosophy, the
heliocentric and geocentric theories. It may be true, as Lagrange and
Montucla say, that the laws which Galileo discovered in Mechanics
implied a profounder genius than the novelties he detected in the sky:
but the latter naturally attracted the greater share of the attention
of the world, and were matter of keener discussion.</p>
<p>It is not to our purpose to speak here of the details and of the
occasion of the invention of the Telescope; it is well known that
Galileo constructed his about 1609, and proceeded immediately to apply
it to the heavens. The discovery of the Satellites of Jupiter was
almost immediately the reward of his activity; and these were
announced in his <i>Nuncius Sidereus</i>, published at Venice in 1610.
The title of this work will best convey an idea of the claim it made
to public notice: “The <i>Sidereal Messenger</i>, announcing great and
very wonderful spectacles, and offering them to the consideration of
every one, but especially of philosophers and astronomers; which have
been observed by <i>Galileo Galilei</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c., by the
assistance of a perspective glass lately invented by him; namely, in
the face of the moon, in innumerable fixed stars in the milky-way, in
nebulous stars, but especially in four planets which revolve round
Jupiter at different intervals and periods with a wonderful celerity;
which, hitherto not known to any one, the author has recently been the
first to detect, and has decreed to call the <i>Medicean
stars</i>.”</p>
<p>The interest this discovery excited was intense: and men were at
this period so little habituated to accommodate their convictions on
matters of science to newly observed facts, that several of the
“paper-philosophers,” as Galileo termed them, appear to have thought
they could get rid of these new objects by writing books against them.
The effect which the discovery had upon the reception of the
Copernican system was immediately very considerable. It showed that
the real universe was very different from that which ancient
philosophers had imagined, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page278">278</a></span> and suggested at once the thought that
it contained mechanism more various and more vast than had yet been
conjectured. And when the system of the planet Jupiter thus offered to
the bodily eye a model or image of the solar system according to the
views of Copernicus, it supported the belief of such an arrangement of
the planets, by an analogy all but irresistible. It thus, as a
writer<a id="fnanchor24-5" href="#note24-5"><span
class="fnanchor">24</span></a> of our own times has said, “gave the
<em>holding turn</em> to the opinions of mankind respecting the
Copernican system.” We may trace this effect in Bacon, even though he
does not assent to the motion of the earth. “We affirm,” he says,<a
id="fnanchor25-5" href="#note25-5"><span
class="fnanchor">25</span></a> “the <em>sun-following arrangement</em>
(solisequium) of Venus and Mercury; since it has been found by Galileo
that Jupiter also has attendants.”</p>

253.</div>
<p>The <i>Nuncius Sidereus</i> contained other discoveries which had
the same tendency in other ways. The examination of the moon showed,
or at least seemed to show, that she was a solid body, with a surface
extremely rugged and irregular. This, though perhaps not bearing
directly upon the question of the heliocentric theory, was yet a blow
to the Aristotelians, who had, in their philosophy, made the moon a
body of a kind altogether different from this, and had given an
abundant quantity of reasons for the visible marks on her surface, all
proceeding on these preconceived views. Others of his discoveries
produced the same effect; for instance, the new stars invisible to the
naked eye, and those extraordinary appearances called Nebulæ.</p>
<p>But before the end of the year, Galileo had new information to
communicate, bearing more decidedly on the Copernican controversy.
This intelligence was indeed decisive with regard to the motion of
Venus about the sun; for he found that that planet, in the course of
her revolution, assumes the same succession of phases which the moon
exhibits in the course of a month. This he expressed by a Latin
verse:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0 bot">Cynthiæ figuras æmulatur mater amorum:</span><br />
<span class="i0">The Queen of Love like Cynthia shapes her
forms:</span>
</div></div>
<p class="noind">transposing the letters of this line in the published
account, according to the practice of the age; which thus showed the
ancient love for combining verbal puzzles with scientific discoveries,
while it betrayed the newer feeling, of jealousy respecting the
priority of discovery of physical facts.</p>
<p>It had always been a formidable objection to the Copernican theory
that this appearance of the planets had not been observed. The author
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page279">279</a></span> of that theory
had endeavored to account for this, by supposing that the rays of the
sun passed freely through the body of the planet; and Galileo takes
occasion to praise him for not being deterred from adopting the system
which, on the whole, appeared to agree best with the phenomena, by
meeting with some appearances which it did not enable him to
explain.<a id="fnanchor26-5" href="#note26-5"><span
class="fnanchor">26</span></a> Yet while the fate of the theory was
yet undecided, this could not but be looked upon as a weak point in
its defences.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note26-5"
href="#fnanchor26-5">26</a></span> Drinkwater-Bethune, <i>Life of
Galileo</i>, p. 35.</div>
<p>The objection, in another form also, was embarrassing alike to the
Ptolemaic and Copernican systems. Why, it was asked, did not Venus
appear four times as large when nearest to the earth, as when furthest
from it? The author of the Epistle prefixed to Copernicus’s work had
taken refuge in this argument from the danger of being supposed to
believe in the reality of the system; and Bruno had attempted to
answer it by saying, that luminous bodies were not governed by the
same laws of perspective as opake ones. But a more satisfactory answer
now readily offered itself. Venus does not appear four times as large
when she is four times as near, because her <em>bright part</em> is
<em>not</em> four times as large, though her visible diameter is; and
as she is too small for us to see her shape with the naked eye, we
judge of her size only by the quantity of light.</p>
<p>The other great discoveries made in the heavens by means of
telescopes, as that of Saturn’s ring and his satellites, the spots in
the sun, and others, belong to the further progress of astronomy. But
we may here observe, that this doctrine of the motion of Mercury and
Venus about the sun was further confirmed by Kepler’s observation of
the transit of the former planet over the sun in 1631. Our countryman
Horrox was the first person who, in 1639, had the satisfaction of
seeing a transit of Venus.</p>
<p>These events are a remarkable instance of the way in which a
discovery in art (for at this period, the making of telescopes must be
mainly so considered) may influence the progress of science. We shall
soon have to notice a still more remarkable example of the way in
which two sciences (Astronomy and Mechanics) may influence and promote
the progress of each other. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page280">280</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 4.&#8212;<i>The Copernican System opposed on
Theological Grounds.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> doctrine of the Earth’s motion round
the Sun, when it was asserted and promulgated by Copernicus, soon
after 1500, excited no visible alarm among the theologians of his own
time. Indeed, it was received with favor by the most intelligent
ecclesiastics; and lectures in support of the heliocentric doctrine
were delivered in the ecclesiastical colleges. But the assertion and
confirmation of this doctrine by Galileo, about a century later,
excited a storm of controversy, and was visited with severe
condemnation. Galileo’s own behavior appears to have provoked the
interference of the ecclesiastical authorities; but there must have
been a great change in the temper of the times to make it possible for
his adversaries to bring down the sentence of the Inquisition upon
opinions which had been so long current without giving any serious
offence.</p>
<p>[2d Ed.] [It appears to me that the different degree of toleration
accorded to the heliocentric theory in the time of Copernicus and of
Galileo, must be ascribed in a great measure to the controversies and
alarms which had in the mean time arisen out of the Reformation in
religion, and which had rendered the Romish Church more jealous of
innovations in received opinions than it had previously been. It
appears too that the discussion of such novel doctrines was, at that
time at least, less freely tolerated in Italy than in other countries.
In 1597, Kepler writes to Galileo thus: “Confide Galilæe et
progredere. Si bene conjecto, pauci de præcipuis Europæ Mathematicis a
nobis secedere volent; tanta vis est veritatis. Si tibi Italia minus
est idonea ad publicationem et si aliqua habitures es impedimenta,
forsan Germania nobis hanc libertatem concedet.”&#8212;Venturi,
<i>Mem. di Galileo</i>, vol. i. p. 19.</p>
<p>I would not however be understood to assert the condemnation of new
doctrines in science to be either a general or a characteristic
practice of the Romish Church. Certainly the intelligent and
cultivated minds of Italy, and many of the most eminent of her
ecclesiastics among them, have always been the foremost in promoting
and welcoming the progress of science: and, as I have stated, there
were found among the Italian ecclesiastics of Galileo’s time many of
the earliest and most enlightened adherents of the Copernican system.
The condemnation of the doctrine of the earth’s motion, is, so far as
I am aware, the only instance in which the Papal authority has
pronounced a decree upon a point of science. And the most candid of
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page281">281</a></span> adherents
of the Romish Church condemn the assumption of authority in such
matters, which in this one instance, at least, was made by the
ecclesiastical tribunals. The author of the <i>Ages of Faith</i> (book
viii. p. 248) says, “A congregation, it is to be lamented, declared
the new system to be opposed to Scripture, and therefore heretical.”
In more recent times, as I have elsewhere remarked,<a
id="fnanchor27-5" href="#note27-5"><span
class="fnanchor">27</span></a> the Church of Authority and the Church
of Private Judgment have each its peculiar temptations and dangers,
when there appears to be a discrepance between Scripture and
Philosophy.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note27-5"
href="#fnanchor27-5">27</a></span> <i>Phil. Ind. Sci.</i> book x.
chap. 4.</div>
<p>But though we may acquit the popes and cardinals in Galileo’s time
of stupidity and perverseness in rejecting manifest scientific truths,
I do not see how we can acquit them of dissimulation and duplicity.
Those persons appear to me to defend in a very strange manner the
conduct of the ecclesiastical authorities of that period, who boast of
the liberality with which Copernican professors were placed by them in
important offices, at the very time when the motion of the earth had
been declared by the same authorities contrary to Scripture. Such
merits cannot make us approve of their conduct in demanding from
Galileo a public recantation of the system which they thus favored in
other ways, and which they had repeatedly told Galileo he might hold
as much as he pleased. Nor can any one, reading the plain language of
the Sentence passed upon Galileo, and of the Abjuration forced from
him, find any value in the plea which has been urged, that the opinion
was denominated a <em>heresy</em> only in a wide, improper, and
technical sense.</p>
<p>But if we are thus unable to excuse the conduct of Galileo’s
judges, I do not see how we can give our unconditional admiration to
the philosopher himself. Perhaps the conventional decorum which, as we
have seen, was required in treating of the Copernican system, may
excuse or explain the furtive mode of insinuating his doctrines which
he often employs, and which some of his historians admire as subtle
irony, while others blame it as insincerity. But I do not see with
what propriety Galileo can be looked upon as a “Martyr of Science.”
Undoubtedly he was very desirous of promoting what he conceived to be
the cause of philosophical truth; but it would seem that, while he was
restless and eager in urging his opinions, he was always ready to make
such submissions as the spiritual tribunals required. He would really
have acted as a martyr, if he had uttered <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page282">282</a></span> his “E pur si muove,” in the place of
his abjuration, not after it. But even in this case he would have been
a martyr to a cause of which the merit was of a mingled scientific
character; for his own special and favorite share in the reasonings by
which the Copernican system was supported, was the argument drawn from
the flux and reflux of the sea, which argument is altogether false. He
considered this as supplying a mechanical ground of belief, without
which the mere astronomical reasons were quite insufficient; but in
this case he was deserted by the mechanical sagacity which appeared in
his other speculations.]</p>
<p>The heliocentric doctrine had for a century been making its way
into the minds of thoughtful men, on the general ground of its
simplicity and symmetry. Galileo appears to have thought that now,
when these original recommendations of the system had been reinforced
by his own discoveries and reasonings, it ought to be universally
acknowledged as a truth and a reality. And when arguments against the
fixity of the sun and the motion of the earth were adduced from the
expressions of Scripture, he could not be satisfied without
maintaining his favorite opinion to be conformable to Scripture as
well as to Philosophy; and he was very eager in his attempts to obtain
from authority a declaration to this effect. The ecclesiastical
authorities were naturally averse to express themselves in favor of a
novel opinion, startling to the common mind, and contrary to the most
obvious meaning of the words of the Bible; and when they were
compelled to pronounce, they decided against Galileo and his
doctrines. He was accused before the Inquisition in 1615; but at that
period the result was that he was merely recommended to confine
himself to the mathematical reasonings upon the system, and to abstain
from meddling with the Scripture. Galileo’s zeal for his opinions soon
led him again to bring the question under the notice of the Pope, and
the result was a declaration of the Inquisition that the doctrine of
the earth’s motion appeared to be contrary to the Sacred Scripture.
Galileo was prohibited from defending and teaching this doctrine in
any manner, and promised obedience to this injunction. But in 1632 he
published his <span class="correction" title="omitted in
text">“</span><i>Dialogo delli due Massimi Sistemi del Mondo,
Tolemaico e Copernicano</i>:” and in this he defended the heliocentric
system by all the strongest arguments which its admirers used. Not
only so, but he introduced into this <i>Dialogue</i> a character under
the name of Simplicius, in whose mouth was put the defence of all the
ancient dogmas, and who was represented as defeated at all points in
the discussion; <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page283">283</a></span>
and he prefixed to the <i>Dialogue</i> a Notice, <i>To the Discreet
Reader</i>, in which, in a vein of transparent irony, he assigned his
reasons for the publication. “Some years ago,” he says, “a wholesome
edict was promulgated at Rome, which, in order to check the perilous
scandals of the present age, imposed silence upon the Pythagorean
opinion of the motion of the earth. There were not wanting,” he adds,
“persons who rashly asserted that this decree was the result, not of a
judicious inquiry, but of a passion ill-informed; and complaints were
heard that counsellors, utterly unacquainted with astronomical
observations, ought not to be allowed, with their undue prohibitions,
to clip the wings of speculative intellects. At the hearing of rash
lamentations like these, my zeal could not keep silence.” And he then
goes on to say that he wishes, by the publication of his
<i>Dialogue</i> to show that the subject had been fully examined at
Rome. The result of this was that Galileo was condemned for his
infraction of the injunction laid upon him in 1616; his
<i>Dialogue</i> was prohibited; he himself was commanded to abjure on
his knees the doctrine which he had taught; and this abjuration he
performed.</p>
<p>This celebrated event must be looked upon rather as a question of
decorum than a struggle in which the interests of truth and free
inquiry were deeply concerned. The general acceptance of the
Copernican System was no longer a matter of doubt. Several persons in
the highest positions, including the Pope himself, looked upon the
doctrine with favorable eyes; and had shown their interest in Galileo
and his discoveries. They had tried to prevent his involving himself
in trouble by discussing the question on scriptural grounds. It is
probable that his knowledge of those favorable dispositions towards
himself and his opinions led him to suppose that the slightest color
of professed submission to the Church in his belief, would enable his
arguments in favor of the system to pass unvisited: the notice which I
have quoted, in which the irony is quite transparent and the sarcasm
glaringly obvious, was deemed too flimsy a veil for the purpose of
decency, and indeed must have aggravated the offence. But it is not to
be supposed that the inquisitors believed Galileo’s abjuration to be
sincere, or even that they wished it to be so. It is stated that when
Galileo had made his renunciation of the earth’s motion, he rose from
his knees, and stamping on the earth with his foot, said, <i>E pur si
muove</i>&#8212;“And yet it <em>does</em> move.” This is sometimes
represented as the heroic soliloquy of a mind cherishing its
conviction of the truth in spite of persecution; I think we may more
naturally conceive it uttered as a playful <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page284">284</a></span> epigram in the ear of a cardinal’s
secretary, with a full knowledge that it would be immediately repeated
to his master.</p>
<p>[2d Ed.] [Throughout the course of the proceedings against him,
Galileo was treated with great courtesy and indulgence. He was
condemned to a formal imprisonment and a very light discipline. “Te
damnamus ad formalem carcerem hujus S. Officii ad tempus arbitrio
nostro limitandum; et titulo pœnitentiæ salutaris præcipimus ut tribus
annis futuris recites <span class="correction" title="emended from semil">semel</span> in hebdomadâ septem psalmos
penitentiales.” But this confinement was reduced to his being placed
under some slight restrictions, first at the house of Nicolini, the
ambassador of his own sovereign, and afterwards at the country seat of
Archbishop Piccolomini, one of his own warmest friends.</p>
<p>It has sometimes been asserted or insinuated that Galileo was
subjected to bodily torture. An argument has been drawn from the
expressions used in his sentence: “Cum vero nobis videretur non esse a
te integram veritatem pronunciatam circa tuam intentionem; judicavimus
necesse esse venire ad rigorosum examen tui, in quo respondisti
catholicè.” It has been argued by M. Libri (<i>Hist. des Sciences
Mathématiques en Italie</i>, vol. <span class="sc">iv</span>. p. 259),
and M. Quinet (<i>L’Ultramontanisme</i>, <span class="sc">iv</span>.
Leçon, p. 104), that the <i>rigorosum examen</i> necessarily implies
bodily torture, notwithstanding that no such thing is mentioned by
Galileo and his contemporaries, and notwithstanding the consideration
with which he was treated in all other respects: but M. Biot more
justly remarks (<i>Biogr. Univ.</i> Art. <i>Galileo</i>), that such a
procedure is incredible.</p>
<p>To the opinion of M. Biot, we may add that of Delambre, who rejects
the notion of Galileo’s having been put to the torture, as
inconsistent with the general conduct of the authorities towards him,
and as irreconcilable with the accounts of the trial given by Galileo
himself, and by a servant of his, who never quitted him for an
instant. He adds also, that it is inconsistent with the words of his
sentence, “ne tuus iste gravis et perniciosus error ac transgressio
remaneat <em>omnino impunitus</em>;” for the error would have been
already very far from impunity, if Galileo had been previously
subjected to the rack. He adds, very reasonably, “il ne faut noircir
personne sans preuve, pas même l’Inquisition;”&#8212;we must not
calumniate even the Inquisition.]</p>
<p>The ecclesiastical authorities having once declared the doctrine of
the earth’s motion to be contrary to Scripture and heretical, long
adhered in form to this declaration, and did not allow the Copernican
system to be taught in any other way than as an “hypothesis.” The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page285">285</a></span> Padua edition
of Galileo’s works, published in 1744, contains the <i>Dialogue</i>
which now, the editors say, “Esce finalmente a pubblico libero uso
colle debite licenze,” is now at last freely published with the
requisite license; but they add, “quanto alla Quistione principale del
moto della terra, anche noi ci conformiamo alla ritrazione et protesta
dell’ Autore, dichiarando nella piu solenne forma, che non può, nè dee
ammetersi se non come pura Ipotesi Mathematice, che serve a spiegare
piu agevolamento certi fenomeni;” “neither can nor ought to be
admitted except as a convenient hypothesis.” And in the edition of
Newton’s <i>Principia</i>, published in 1760, by Le Sueur and
Jacquier, of the Order of Minims, the editors prefix to the Third Book
their <i>Declaratio</i>, that though Newton assumes the hypothesis of
the motion of the earth, and therefore they had used similar language,
they were, in doing this, assuming a character which did not belong to
them. “Hinc alienam coacti sumus gerere personam.” They add, “Cæterum
latis a summis Pontificibus contra telluris motum Decretis, nos
obsequi profitemur.”</p>
<p>By thus making decrees against a doctrine which in the course of
time was established as an indisputable scientific truth, the See of
Rome was guilty of an unwise and unfortunate stretch of ecclesiastical
authority. But though we do not hesitate to pronounce such a judgment
on this case, we may add that there is a question of no small real
difficulty, which the progress of science often brings into notice, as
it did then. The Revelation on which our religion is founded, seems to
declare, or to take for granted, opinions on points on which Science
also gives her decision; and we then come to this dilemma,&#8212;that
doctrines, established by a scientific use of reason, may seem to
contradict the declarations of Revelation, according to our view of
its meaning;&#8212;and yet, that we cannot, in consistency with our
religious views, make reason a judge of the truth of revealed
doctrines. In the case of Astronomy, on which Galileo was called in
question, the general sense of cultivated and sober-minded men has
long ago drawn that distinction between religious and physical tenets,
which is necessary to resolve this dilemma. On this point, it is
reasonably held, that the phrases which are employed in Scripture
respecting astronomical facts, are not to be made use of to guide our
scientific opinions; they may be supposed to answer their end if they
fall in with common notions, and are thus effectually subservient to
the moral and religions import of Revelation. But the establishment of
this distinction was not accomplished without long and distressing
controversies. Nor, if we wish to <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page286">286</a></span> include all cases in which the same
dilemma may again come into play is it easy to lay down an adequate
canon for the purpose. For we can hardly foresee, beforehand, what
part of the past history of the universe may eventually be found to
come within the domain of science; or what bearing the tenets, which
science establishes, may have upon our view of the providential and
revealed government of the world. But without attempting here to
generalize on this subject, there are two reflections which may be
worth our notice: they are supported by what took place in reference
to Astronomy on the occasion of which we are speaking; and may, at
other periods, be applicable to other sciences.</p>
<p>In the first place, the meaning which any generation puts upon the
phrases of Scripture, depends, more than is at first sight supposed
upon the received philosophy of the time. Hence, while men imagine
that they are contending for Revelation, they are, in fact, contending
for their own interpretation of Revelation, unconsciously adapted to
what they believe to be rationally probable. And the new
interpretation, which the new philosophy requires, and which appears
to the older school to be a fatal violence done to the authority of
religion, is accepted by their successors without the dangerous
results which were apprehended. When the language of Scripture,
invested with its new meaning, has become familiar to men, it is found
that the ideas which it calls up, are quite as reconcilable as the
former ones were with the soundest religious views. And the world then
looks back with surprise at the error of those who thought that the
essence of Revelation was involved in their own arbitrary version of
some collateral circumstance. At the present day we can hardly
conceive how reasonable men should have imagined that religious
reflections on the stability of the earth, and the beauty and use of
the luminaries which revolve round it, would be interfered with by its
being acknowledged that this rest and motion are apparent only.</p>
<p>In the next place, we may observe that those who thus adhere
tenaciously to the traditionary or arbitrary mode of understanding
Scriptural expressions of physical events, are always strongly
condemned by succeeding generations. They are looked upon with
contempt by the world at large, who cannot enter into the obsolete
difficulties with which they encumbered themselves; and with pity by
the more considerate and serious, who know how much sagacity and
rightmindedness are requisite for the conduct of philosophers and
religious men on such occasions; but who know also how weak and vain
is the attempt <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page287">287</a></span>
to get rid of the difficulty by merely denouncing the new tenets as
inconsistent with religious belief, and by visiting the promulgators
of them with severity such as the state of opinions and institutions
may allow. The prosecutors of Galileo are still up to the scorn and
aversion of mankind: although, as we have seen, they did not act till
it seemed that their position compelled them to do so, and then
proceeded with all the gentleness and moderation which were compatible
with judicial forms.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 5.&#8212;<i>The Heliocentric Theory confirmed on
Physical considerations.&#8212;</i>(<i>Prelude to Kepler’s
Astronomical Discoveries.</i>)</h4>
<p><span class="sc">By</span> physical views, I mean, as I have
already said, those which depend on the causes of the motions of
matter, as, for instance, the consideration of the nature and laws of
the force by which bodies fall downwards. Such considerations were
necessarily and immediately brought under notice by the examination of
the Copernican theory; but the loose and inaccurate notions which
prevailed respecting the nature and laws of force, prevented, for some
time, all distinct reasoning on this subject, and gave truth little
advantage over error. The formation of a new Science, the Science of
Motion and its Causes, was requisite, before the heliocentric system
could have justice done it with regard to this part of the
subject.</p>
<p>This discussion was at first carried on, as was to be expected, in
terms of the received, that is, the Aristotelian doctrines. Thus,
Copernicus says that terrestrial things appear to be at rest when they
have a motion according to nature, that is, a circular motion; and
ascend or descend when they have, in addition to this, a rectilinear
motion by which they <span class="correction" title="emended from
endeaver">endeavor</span> to get into their own place. But his
disciples soon began to question the Aristotelian dogmas, and to seek
for sounder views by the use of their own reason. “The great argument
against this system,” says Mæstlin, “is that heavy bodies are said to
move to the centre of the universe, and light bodies from the centre.
But I would ask, where do we get this experience of heavy and light
bodies? and how is our knowledge on these subjects extended so far
that we can reason with certainty concerning the centre of the whole
universe? Is not the only residence and home of all the things which
are heavy and light to us, the earth and the air which surrounds it?
and what is the earth and the ambient air, with respect to the
immensity of the universe? It is a point, a punctule, or something, if
there be any thing, still less. As our light and heavy bodies tend to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page288">288</a></span> the centre of
our earth, it is credible that the sun, the moon, and the other
lights, have a similar affection, by which they remain round as we see
them; but none of these centres is necessarily the centre of the
universe.”</p>
<p>The most obvious and important physical difficulty attendant upon
the supposition of the motion of the earth was thus stated: If the
earth move, how is it that a stone, dropped from the top of a high
tower, falls exactly at the foot of the tower? since the tower being
carried from west to east by the diurnal revolution of the earth, the
stone must be left behind to the west of the place from which it was
let fall. The proper answer to this was, that the motion which the
falling body received from its tendency downwards was
<em>compounded</em> with the motion which, before it fell, it had in
virtue of the earth’s rotation: but this answer could not be clearly
made or apprehended, till Galileo and his pupils had established the
laws of such Compositions of motion arising from different forces.
Rothman, Kepler, and other defenders of the Copernican system, gave
their reply somewhat at a venture, when they asserted that the motion
of the earth was communicated to bodies at its surface. Still, the
facts which indicate and establish this truth are obvious, when the
subject is steadily considered; and the Copernicans soon found that
they had the superiority of argument on this point as well as others.
The attacks upon the Copernican system by Durret, Morin, Riccioli, and
the defence of it by Galileo, Lansberg, Gassendi,<a id="fnanchor28-5"
href="#note28-5"><span class="fnanchor">28</span></a> left on all
candid reasoners a clear impression in favour of the system. Morin
attempted to stop the motion of the earth, which he called breaking
its wings; his <i>Alæ Terræ Fractæ</i> was published in 1643, and
answered by Gassendi. And Riccioli, as late as 1653, in his
<i>Almagestum Novum</i>, enumerated fifty-seven Copernican arguments,
and pretended to refute them all: but such reasonings now made no
converts; and by this time the mechanical objections to the motion of
the earth were generally seen to be baseless, as we shall relate when
we come to speak of the progress of Mechanics as a distinct science.
In the mean time, the beauty and simplicity of the heliocentric theory
were perpetually winning the admiration even of those who, from one
cause or other, refused their assent to it. Thus Riccioli, the last of
its considerable opponents, allows its superiority in these respects;
and acknowledges (in 1653) that the Copernican belief appears rather
to increase than diminish under the condemnation of the decrees of the
Cardinals. He applies to it the lines of Horace:<a id="fnanchor29-5"

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page289">289</a></span> We have
spoken of the influence of the motion of the earth on the motions of
bodies at its surface; but the notion of a physical connection among
the parts of the universe was taken up by Kepler in another point of
view, which would probably have been considered as highly fantastical,
if the result had not been, that it led to by far the most magnificent
and most certain train of truths which the whole expanse of human
knowledge can show. I speak of the persuasion of the existence of
numerical and geometrical laws connecting the distances, times, and
forces of the bodies which revolve about the central sun. That steady
and intense conviction of this governing principle, which made its
development and verification the leading employment of Kepler’s most
active and busy life, cannot be considered otherwise than as an
example of profound sagacity. That it was connected, though dimly and
obscurely, with the notion of a central agency or influence of some
sort, emanating from the sun, cannot be doubted. Kepler, in his first
essay of this kind, the <i>Mysterium Cosmographicum</i>, says, “The
motion of the earth, which Copernicus had proved by
<em>mathematical</em> reasons, I wanted to prove by <em>physical</em>,
or, if you prefer it, metaphysical.” In the twentieth chapter of that
work, he endeavors to make out some relation between the distances of
the Planets from the Sun and their velocities. The inveterate yet
vague notions of forces which preside in this attempt, may be judged
of by such passages as the following:&#8212;“We must suppose one of
two things; either that the moving spirits, in proportion as they are
more removed from the sun, are more feeble; or that there is one
moving spirit in the centre of all the orbits, namely, in the sun,
which urges each body the more vehemently in proportion as it is
nearer; but in more distant spaces languishes in consequence of the
remoteness and attenuation of its virtue.”</p>
<p>We must not forget, in reading such passages, that they were
written under a belief that force was requisite to keep up, as well as
to change the motion of each planet; and that a body, moving in a
circle, would <em>stop</em> when the force of the central point
ceased, instead of moving off in a tangent to the circle, as we now
know it would do. The force which Kepler supposes is a tangential
force, in the direction of the body’s motion, and nearly perpendicular
to the radius; the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page290">290</a></span> force which modern philosophy has
established, is in the direction of the radius, and nearly
perpendicular to the body’s path. Kepler was right no further than in
his suspicion of a connection between the cause of motion and the
distance from the centre; not only was his knowledge imperfect in all
particulars, but his most general conception of the mode of action of
a cause of motion was erroneous.</p>
<p>With these general convictions and these physical notions in his
mind, Kepler endeavored to detect numerical and geometrical relations
among the parts of the solar system. After extraordinary labor,
perseverance, and ingenuity, he was eminently successful in
discovering such relations; but the glory and merit of interpreting
them according to their physical meaning, was reserved for his greater
successor, Newton.  ~Additional material in the <a

taken a view of the discoveries of Kepler, appear to have been
surprised and somewhat discontented that conjectures, apparently so
fanciful and arbitrary as his, should have led to important
discoveries. They seem to have been alarmed at the <em>Moral</em> that
their readers might draw, from the tale of a Quest of Knowledge, in
which the Hero, though fantastical and self-willed, and violating in
his conduct, as they conceived, all right rule and sound philosophy,
is rewarded with the most signal triumphs. Perhaps one or two
reflections may in some measure reconcile us to this result.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note30-5"
href="#fnanchor30-5">30</a></span> Laplace, <i>Précis de l’Hist.
d’Ast.</i> p. 94. “Il est affligeant pour l’esprit humain de voir ce
grand homme, même dans ses derniers ouvrages, se complaire avec
délices dans ses chimériques spéculations, et les regarder comme l’âme
et la vie de l’astronomie.”<br />
&#8195;<i>Hist. of Ast.</i>, L. U. K., p. 53. “This success [of Kepler]

experiment and rigorous induction as the only means to interrogate
nature with success.”<br />

“Kepler’s miraculous good fortune in seizing truths across the wildest
and most absurd theories.” P. 54, “The danger of attempting to follow
his method in the pursuit of truth.”</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page291">291</a></span> In the first
place, we may observe that the leading thought which suggested and
animated all Kepler’s attempts was true, and we may add, sagacious and
philosophical; namely, that there must be <em>some</em> numerical or
geometrical relations among the times, distances, and velocities of
the revolving bodies of the solar system. This settled and constant
conviction of an important truth regulated all the conjectures,
apparently so capricious and fanciful, which he made and examined,
respecting particular relations in the system.</p>
<p>In the next place, we may venture to say, that advances in
knowledge are not commonly made without the previous exercise of some
boldness and license in guessing. The discovery of new truths
requires, undoubtedly, minds careful and scrupulous in examining what
is suggested; but it requires, no less, such as are quick and fertile
in suggesting. What is Invention, except the talent of rapidly calling
before us many possibilities, and selecting the appropriate one? It is
true, that when we have rejected all the inadmissible suppositions,
they are quickly forgotten by most persons; and few think it necessary
to dwell on these discarded hypotheses, and on the process by which
they were condemned, as Kepler has done. But all who discover truths
must have reasoned upon many errors, to obtain each truth; every
accepted doctrine must have been one selected out of many candidates.
In making many conjectures, which on trial proved erroneous, Kepler
was no more fanciful or unphilosophical than other discoverers have
been. Discovery is not a “cautious” or “rigorous” process, in the
sense of abstaining from such suppositions. But there are great
differences in different cases, in the facility with which guesses are
proved to be errors, and in the degree of attention with which the
error and the proof are afterwards dwelt on. Kepler certainly was
remarkable for the labor which he gave to such self-refutations, and
for the candor and copiousness with which he narrated them; his works
are in this way extremely curious and amusing; and are a very
instructive exhibition of the mental process of discovery. But in this
respect, I venture to believe, they exhibit to us the usual process
(somewhat caricatured) of inventive minds: they rather exemplify the
<em>rule</em> of genius than (as has generally been hitherto taught)
the <em>exception</em>. We may add, that if many of Kepler’s guesses
now appear fanciful and absurd, because time and observation have
refuted them, others, which were at the time equally gratuitous, have
been confirmed by succeeding discoveries in a manner which makes them
appear marvellously sagacious; as, for instance, his assertion of the
rotation of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page292">292</a></span> the
sun on his axis, before the invention of the telescope, and his
opinion that the obliquity of the ecliptic was decreasing, but would,
after a long-continued diminution, stop, and then increase again.<a
id="fnanchor31-5" href="#note31-5"><span
class="fnanchor">31</span></a> Nothing can be more just, as well as
more poetically happy, than Kepler’s picture of the philosopher’s
pursuit of scientific truth, conveyed by means of an allusion to
Virgil’s shepherd and shepherdess:</p>

175.</div>
<p>We may notice as another peculiarity of Kepler’s reasonings, the
length and laboriousness of the processes by which he discovered the
errors of his first guesses. One of the most important talents
requisite for a discoverer, is the ingenuity and skill which devises
means for rapidly testing false suppositions as they offer themselves.
This talent Kepler did not possess: he was not even a good
arithmetical calculator, often making mistakes, some of which he
detected and laments, while others escaped him to the last. But his
defects in this respect were compensated by his courage and
perseverance in undertaking and executing such tasks; and, what was
still more admirable, he never allowed the labor he had spent upon any
conjecture to produce any reluctance in abandoning the hypothesis, as
soon as he had evidence of its inaccuracy. The only way in which he
rewarded himself for his trouble, was by describing to the world, in
his lively manner, his schemes, exertions, and feelings.</p>
<p>The <em>mystical</em> parts of Kepler’s opinions, as his belief in
astrology, his persuasion that the earth was an animal, and many of
the loose moral and spiritual as well as sensible analyses by which he
represented to himself the powers which he supposed to prevail in the
universe, do not appear to have interfered with his discovery, but
rather to have stimulated his invention, and animated his exertions.
Indeed, where there are clear scientific ideas on one subject in the
mind, it does not appear that mysticism on others is at all
unfavorable to the successful prosecution of research.</p>
<p>I conceive, then, that we may consider Kepler’s character as
containing the general features of the character of a scientific
discoverer, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page293">293</a></span>
though some of the features are exaggerated, and some too feebly
marked. His spirit of invention was undoubtedly very fertile and
ready, and this and his perseverance served to remedy his deficiency
in mathematical artifice and method. But the peculiar physiognomy is
given to his intellectual aspect by his dwelling in a most prominent
manner on those erroneous trains of thought which other persons
conceal from the world, and often themselves forget, because they find
means of stopping them at the outset. In the beginning of his book
(<i>Argumenta Capitum</i>) he says, “if Christopher Columbus, if
Magellan, if the Portuguese, when they narrate their wanderings, are
not only excused, but if we do not wish these passages omitted, and
should lose much pleasure if they were, let no one blame me for doing
the same.” Kepler’s talents were a kindly and fertile soil, which he
cultivated with abundant toil and vigor; but with great scantiness of
agricultural skill and implements. Weeds and the grain throve and
flourished side by side almost undistinguished; and he gave a peculiar
appearance to his harvest, by gathering and preserving the one class
of plants with as much care and diligence as the other.</p>
<h4 id="b5-4-2"><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Kepler’s Discovery of his
Third Law.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">I shall</span> now give some account of Kepler’s
speculations and discoveries. The first discovery which he attempted,
the relation among the successive distances of the planets from the
sun, was a failure; his doctrine being without any solid foundation,
although propounded by him with great triumph, in a work which he
called <i>Mysterium Cosmographicum</i>, and which was published in
1596. The account which he gives of the train of his thoughts on this
subject, namely, the various suppositions assumed, examined, and
rejected, is curious and instructive, for the reasons just stated; but
we shall not dwell upon these essays, since they led only to an
opinion now entirely abandoned. The doctrine which professed to give
the true relation of the orbits of the different planets, was thus
delivered:<a id="fnanchor32-5" href="#note32-5"><span
class="fnanchor">32</span></a> “The orbit of the earth is a circle:
round the sphere to which this circle belongs, describe a
dodecahedron; the sphere including this will give the orbit of Mars.
Round Mars describe a tetrahedron; the circle including this will be
the orbit of Jupiter. Describe a cube round Jupiter’s orbit; the

<p>But though this part of the <i>Mysterium Cosmographicum</i> was a
failure, the same researches continued to occupy Kepler’s mind; and
twenty-two years later led him to one of the important rules known to
us as “Kepler’s Laws;” namely, to the rule connecting the mean
distances of the planets from the sun with the times of their
revolutions. This rule is expressed in mathematical terms, by saying
that the squares of the periodic times are in the same proportion as
the cubes of the distances; and was of great importance to Newton in
leading him to the law of the sun’s attractive force. We may properly
consider this discovery as the sequel of the train of thought already
noticed. In the beginning of the <i>Mysterium</i>, Kepler had said,
“In the year 1595, I brooded with the whole energy of my mind on the
subject of the Copernican system. There were three things in
particular of which I pertinaciously sought the causes why they are
not other than they are; the number, the size, and the motion of the
orbits.” We have seen the nature of his attempt to account for the two
first of these points. He had also made some essays to connect the
motions of the planets with their distances, but with his success in
this respect he was not himself completely satisfied. But in the fifth
book of the <i>Harmonice Mundi</i>, published in 1619, he says, “What
I prophesied two-and-twenty years ago as soon as I had discovered the
Five Solids among the Heavenly Bodies; what I firmly believed before I
had seen the <i>Harmonics</i> of Ptolemy; what I promised my friends
in the title of this book (<i>On the most perfect Harmony of the
Celestial Motions</i>) which I named before I was sure of my
discovery; what sixteen years ago I regarded as a thing to be sought;
that for which I joined Tycho Brahe, for which I settled in Prague,
for which I have devoted the best part of my life to astronomical
contemplations; at length I have brought to light, and have recognized
its truth beyond my most sanguine expectations.”</p>
<p>The rule thus referred to is stated in the third Chapter of this
fifth Book. “It is,” he says, “a most certain and exact thing that the
proportion which exists between the periodic times of any two planets
is precisely the sesquiplicate of the proportion of their mean
distances; that is, of the radii of the orbits. Thus, the period of
the earth is one year, that of Saturn thirty years; if any one trisect
the proportion, that <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page295">295</a></span> is, take the cube root of it, and double
the proportion so found, that is, square it, he will find the exact
proportion of the distances of the Earth and of Saturn from the sun.
For the cube root of 1 is 1, and the square of this is 1; and the cube
root of 30 is greater than 3, and therefore the square of it is
greater than 9. And Saturn at his mean distance from the sun is at a
little more than 9 times the mean distance of the Earth.”</p>
<p>When we now look back at the time and exertions which the
establishment of this law cost Kepler, we are tempted to imagine that
he was strangely blind in not seeing it sooner. His object, we might
reason, was to discover a law connecting the distances and the
periodic times. What law of connection could be more simple and
obvious, we might say, than that one of these quantities should vary
as some <em>power</em> of the other, or as some <em>root</em>; or as
some combination of the two, which in a more general view, may still
be called a <i>power</i>? And if the problem had been viewed in this
way, the question must have occurred, to <em>what</em> power of the
periodic times are the distances proportional? And the answer must
have been, the trial being made, that they are proportional to the
square of the cube root. This <i>ex-post-facto</i> obviousness of
discoveries is a delusion to which we are liable with regard to many
of the most important principles. In the case of Kepler, we may
observe, that the process of connecting two classes of quantities by
comparing their <em>powers</em>, is obvious only to those who are
familiar with general algebraical views; and that in Kepler’s time,
algebra had not taken the place of geometry, as the most usual vehicle
of mathematical reasoning. It may be added, also, that Kepler always
sought his <em>formal</em> laws by means of <em>physical</em>
reasonings; and these, though vague or erroneous, determined the
nature of the mathematical connection which he assumed. Thus in the
<i>Mysterium</i> he had been led by his notions of moving virtue of
the sun to this conjecture, among others&#8212;that, in the planets,
the increase of the periods will be double of the difference of the
distances; which supposition he found to give him an approach to the
actual proportion of the distances, but one not sufficiently close to
satisfy him.</p>
<p>The greater part of the fifth Book of the <i>Harmonics of the
Universe</i> consists in attempts to explain various relations among
the distances, times, and eccentricities of the planets, by means of
the ratios which belong to certain concords and discords. This portion
of the work is so complex and laborious, that probably few modern
readers have had courage to go through it. Delambre acknowledged that
his patience <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page296">296</a></span>
often failed him during the task;<a id="fnanchor33-5"
href="#note33-5"><span class="fnanchor">33</span></a> and subscribes
to the judgment of Bailly: “After this sublime effort, Kepler
replunges himself in the relations of music to the motions, the
distance, and the eccentricities of the planets. In all these harmonic
ratios there is not one true relation; in a crowd of ideas there is
not one truth: he becomes a man after being a spirit of light.”
Certainly these speculations are of no value, but we may look on them
with toleration, when we recollect that Newton has sought for
analogies between the spaces occupied by the prismatic colors and the
notes of the gamut.<a id="fnanchor34-5" href="#note34-5"><span
class="fnanchor">34</span></a> The numerical relations of Concords are
so peculiar that we can easily suppose them to have other bearings
than those which first offer themselves.</p>

<p>It does not belong to my present purpose to speak at length of the
speculations concerning the forces producing the celestial motions by
which Kepler was led to this celebrated law, or of those which he
deduced from it, and which are found in the <i>Epitome Astronomiæ
Copernicanæ</i>, published in 1622. In that work also (p. 554), he
extended this law, though in a loose manner, to the satellites of
Jupiter. These <em>physical</em> speculations were only a vague and
distant prelude to Newton’s discoveries; and the law, as a
<em>formal</em> rule, was complete in itself. We must now attend to
the history of the other two laws with which Kepler’s name is
associated.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Kepler’s Discovery of his First and
Second Laws.&#8212;Elliptical Theory of the Planets.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> propositions designated as Kepler’s
First and Second Laws are these: That the orbits of the planets are
elliptical; and, That the areas described, or <i>swept</i>, by lines
drawn from the sun to the planet, are proportional to the times
employed in the motion.</p>
<p>The occasion of the discovery of these laws was the attempt to
reconcile the theory of Mars to the theory of eccentrics and
epicycles; the event of it was the complete overthrow of that theory,
and the establishment, in its stead, of the Elliptical Theory of the
planets. Astronomy was now ripe for such a change. As soon as
Copernicus had taught men that the orbits of the planets were to be
referred to the sun, it obviously became a question, what was the true
form of these orbits, and the rule of motion of each planet in its own
orbit. Copernicus represented the motions in longitude by means of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page297">297</a></span> eccentrics and
epicycles, as we have already said; and the motions in latitude by
certain <i>librations</i>, or alternate elevations and depressions of
epicycles. If a mathematician had obtained a collection of true
positions of a planet, the form of the orbit and the motion of the
star would have been determined with reference to the sun as well as
to the earth; but this was not possible, for though the
<em>geocentric</em> position, or the direction in which the planet was
seen, could be observed, its distance from the earth was not known.
Hence, when Kepler attempted to determine the orbit of a planet, he
combined the observed geocentric places with successive modifications
of the theory of epicycles, till at last he was led, by one step after
another, to change the epicyclical into the elliptical theory. We may
observe, moreover, that at every step he endeavored to support his new
suppositions by what he called, in his fanciful phraseology, “sending
into the field a reserve of new physical reasonings on the rout and
dispersion of the veterans;”<a id="fnanchor35-5"
href="#note35-5"><span class="fnanchor">35</span></a> that is, by
connecting his astronomical hypotheses with new imaginations, when the
old ones became untenable. We find, indeed, that this is the spirit in
which the pursuit of knowledge is generally carried on with success;
those men arrive at truth who eagerly endeavor to connect remote
points of their knowledge, not those who stop cautiously at each point
till something compels them to go beyond it.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note35-5"
href="#fnanchor35-5">35</a></span> I will insert this passage, as a
specimen of Kepler’s fanciful mode of narrating the defeats which he
received in the war which he carried on with Mars. “Dum in hunc modum
de Martis motibus triumpho, eique ut planè devicto tabularum carceres
et equationum compedes necto, diversis nuntiatur locis, futilem
victoriam ut bellam totâ mole recrudescere. Nam domi quidam hostis ut
captivus contemptus, rupit omnia equationum vincula, carceresque
tabularum effregit. Foris speculatores profligerunt meas causarum
physicarum arcessitas copias earumque jugum excusserunt resumtà
libertate. Jamque parum abfuit quia hostis fugitivus sese cum
rebellibus suis conjungeret meque in desperationem adigeret: nisi
raptim, nova rationum physicarum subsidia, fusis et palantibus
veteribus, submisissem, et qua se captivus proripuisset, omni
diligentia, edoctus vestigiis ipsius nullâ morâ interpositâ
inhæsisserem.”</div>
<p>Kepler joined Tycho Brahe at Prague in 1600, and found him and
Longomontanus busily employed in correcting the theory of Mars; and he
also then entered upon that train of researches which he published in
1609 in his extraordinary work <i>On the Motions of Mars</i>. In this
work, as in others, he gives an account, not only of his success, but
of his failures, explaining, at length, the various suppositions which
he had made, the notions by which he had been led to invent or to
entertain them, the processes by which he had proved their <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page298">298</a></span> falsehood, and the
alternations of hope and sorrow, of vexation and triumph, through
which he had gone. It will not be necessary for us to cite many
passages of these kinds, curious and amusing as they are.</p>
<p>One of the most important truths contained in the motions of Man is
the discovery that the plane of the orbit of the planet should be
considered with reference to the sun itself, instead of referring it
to any of the other centres of motion which the eccentric hypothesis
introduced: and that, when so considered, it had none of the
librations which Ptolemy and Copernicus had attributed to it. The
fourteenth chapter of the second part asserts, “Plana eccentricorum
esse ἀτάλαντα;” that the planes are <em>unlibrating</em>; retaining
always the same inclination to the ecliptic, and the same <em>line of
nodes</em>. With this step Kepler appears to have been justly
delighted. “Copernicus,” he says, “not knowing the value of what he
possessed (his system), undertook to represent Ptolemy, rather than
nature, to which, however, he had approached more nearly than any
other person. For being rejoiced that the quantity of the latitude of
each planet was increased by the approach of the earth to the planet,
according to his theory, he did not venture to reject the rest of
Ptolemy’s increase of latitude, but in order to express it, devised
librations of the planes of the eccentric, depending not upon its own
eccentric, but (most improbably) upon the orbit of the earth, which
has nothing to do with it. I always fought against this impertinent
tying together of two orbits, even before I saw the observations of
Tycho; and I therefore rejoice much that in this, as in others of my
preconceived opinions, the observations were found to be on my side.”
Kepler established his point by a fair and laborious calculation of
the results of observations of Mars made by himself and Tycho Brahe;
and had a right to exult when the result of these calculations
confirmed his views of the symmetry and simplicity of nature.</p>
<p>We may judge of the difficulty of casting off the theory of
eccentrics and epicycles, by recollecting that Copernicus did not do
it at all, and that Kepler only did it after repeated struggles; the
history of which occupies thirty-nine Chapters of his book. At the end
of them he says, “This prolix disputation was necessary, in order to
prepare the way to the natural form of the equations, of which I am
now to treat.<a id="fnanchor36-5" href="#note36-5"><span
class="fnanchor">36</span></a> My first error was, that the path of a
planet is a perfect circle;&#8212;an opinion which was a more
mischievous thief of my time, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page299">299</a></span> in proportion as it was supported by the
authority of all philosophers, and apparently agreeable to
metaphysics.” But before he attempts to correct this erroneous part of
his hypothesis, he sets about discovering the law according to which
the different parts of the orbit are described in the case of the
earth, in which case the eccentricity is so small that the effect of
the oval form is insensible. The result of this inquiry was<a
id="fnanchor37-5" href="#note37-5"><span
class="fnanchor">37</span></a> the Rule, that the time of describing
any arc of the orbit is proportional to the area intercepted between
the curve and two lines drawn from the sun to the extremities of the
arc. It is to be observed that this rule, at first, though it had the
recommendation of being selected after the unavoidable abandonment of
many, which were suggested by the notions of those times, was far from
being adopted upon any very rigid or cautious grounds. A rule had been
proved at the apsides of the orbit, by calculation from observations,
and had then been extended by conjecture to other parts of the orbit;
and the rule of the areas was only an approximate and inaccurate mode
of representing this rule, employed for the purpose of brevity and
convenience, in consequence of the difficulty of applying,
geometrically, that which Kepler now conceived to be the true rule,
and which required him to find the sum of the lines drawn from the sun
to <em>every</em> point of the orbit. When he proceeded to apply this
rule to Mars, in whose orbit the oval form is much more marked,
additional difficulties came in his way; and here again the true
supposition, that the <em>oval</em> is of that special kind called
<i>ellipse</i>, was adopted at first only in order to simplify
calculation,<a id="fnanchor38-5" href="#note38-5"><span
class="fnanchor">38</span></a> and the deviation from exactness in the
result was attributed to the inaccuracy of those approximate
processes. The supposition of the oval had already been forced upon
Purbach in the case of Mercury, and upon Reinhold in the case of the
Moon. The centre of the epicycle was made to describe an egg-shaped
figure in the former case, and a lenticular figure in the latter.<a

<p>3. The bisection of the eccentricity, and a stationary point of

<p>4. The vicarious hypothesis by a free section of the eccentricity
made to agree as nearly as possible with the truth.</p>
<p>5. The physical hypothesis on the supposition of a perfect
circle.</p>
<p>6. The physical hypothesis on the supposition of a perfect
ellipse.</p>
<p>By the physical hypothesis, he meant the doctrine that the time of
a planet’s describing any part of its orbit is proportional to the
distance of the planet from the sun, for which supposition, as we have
said, he conceived that he had assigned physical reasons.</p>
<p>The two last hypotheses came the nearest to the truth, and differed
from it only by about eight minutes, the one in excess and the other
in defect. And, after being much perplexed by this remaining error, it
at last occurred to him<a id="fnanchor41-5" href="#note41-5"><span
class="fnanchor">41</span></a> that he might take another ellipsis,
exactly intermediate between the former one and the circle, and that
this must give the path and the motion of the planet. Making this
assumption, and taking the areas to represent the times, he now saw<a
id="fnanchor42-5" href="#note42-5"><span
class="fnanchor">42</span></a> that both the longitude and the
distances of Mars would agree with observation to the requisite degree
of accuracy. The rectification of the former hypothesis, when thus
stated, may, perhaps, appear obvious. And Kepler informs us that he
had nearly been anticipated in this step (c. 55). “David Fabricius, to
whom I had communicated my hypothesis of cap. 45, was able, by his
observations, to show that it erred in making the distances too short
at mean longitudes; of which he informed me by letter while I was
laboring, by repeated efforts, to discover the true hypothesis. So
nearly did he get the start of me in detecting the truth.” But this
was less easy than it might seem. When Kepler’s first hypothesis was
enveloped in the complex construction requisite in order to apply it
to each point of the orbit, it was far more difficult to see where the
error lay, and Kepler hit upon it only by noticing the coincidences of
certain numbers, which, as he says, raised him as if from sleep, and
gave him a new light. We may observe, also, that he was perplexed to
reconcile this new view, according to which the planet described an
exact ellipse, with his former opinion, which represented the motion
by means of libration in an epicycle. “This,” he says, “was my
greatest trouble, that, though I considered and reflected till I was
almost mad, I could not find why the planet to which, with so much
probability, and with such an exact <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page301">301</a></span> accordance of the distances, libration
in the diameter of the epicycle was attributed, should, according to
the indication of the equations, go in an elliptical path. What an
absurdity on my part! as if libration in the diameter might not be a
way to the ellipse!”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note41-5"
href="#fnanchor41-5">41</a></span> <i>De Stellâ Martis</i>, c.
58.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note42-5"
href="#fnanchor42-5">42</a></span> Ibid. p. 235.</div>
<p>Another scruple respecting this theory arose from the impossibility
of solving, by any geometrical construction, the problem to which
Kepler was thus led, namely, “To divide the area of a semicircle in a
given ratio, by a line drawn from any point of the diameter.” This is
still termed “Kepler’s Problem,” and is, in fact, incapable of exact
geometrical solution. As, however, the calculation can be performed,
and, indeed, was performed by Kepler himself, with a sufficient degree
of accuracy to show that the elliptical hypothesis is true, the
insolubility of this problem is a mere mathematical difficulty in the
deductive process, to which Kepler’s induction gave rise.</p>
<p>Of Kepler’s physical reasonings we shall speak more at length on
another <a href="#kepler">occasion</a>. His numerous and fanciful
hypotheses had discharged their office, when they had suggested to him
his many lines of laborious calculation, and encouraged him under the
exertions and disappointments to which these led. The result of this
work was the formal laws of the motion of Mars, established by a clear
induction, since they represented, with sufficient accuracy, the best
observations. And we may allow that Kepler was entitled to the praise
which he claims in the motto on his first leaf. Ramus had said that if
any one would construct an astronomy without hypothesis, he would be
ready to resign to him his professorship in the University of Paris.
Kepler quotes this passage, and adds, “it is well, Ramus, that you
have run from this pledge, by quitting life and your professorship;<a
id="fnanchor43-5" href="#note43-5"><span
class="fnanchor">43</span></a> if you held it still, I should, with
justice, claim it.” This was not saying too much, since he had
entirely overturned the hypothesis of eccentrics and epicycles, and
had obtained a theory which was a mere representation of the motions
and distances as they were observed.</p>

<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Application of the
Elliptical Theory to the Planets.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> extension of Kepler’s
discoveries concerning the orbit of Mars to the other planets,
obviously offered itself as a strong probability, and was confirmed by
trial. This was made in the first place upon the orbit of Mercury;
which planet, in consequence of the largeness of its eccentricity,
exhibits more clearly than the others the circumstances of the
elliptical motion. These and various other supplementary portions of
the views to which Kepler’s discoveries had led, appeared in the
latter part of his <i>Epitome Astronomiæ Copernicanæ</i>, published in
1622.</p>
<p>The real verification of the new doctrine concerning the orbits and
motions of the heavenly bodies was, of course, to be found in the
construction of tables of those motions, and in the continued
comparison of such tables with observation. Kepler’s discoveries had
been founded, as we have seen, principally on Tycho’s observations.
Longomontanus (so called as being a native of Langberg in Denmark),
published in 1621, in his <i>Astronomia Danica</i>, tables founded
upon the theories as well as the observations of his countryman.
Kepler<a id="fnanchor44-5" href="#note44-5"><span
class="fnanchor">44</span></a> in 1627 published his tables of the
planets, which he called <i>Rudolphine Tables</i>, the result and
application of his own theory. In 1633, Lansberg, a Belgian, published
also <i>Tabulæ Perpetuæ</i>, a work which was ushered into the world
with considerable pomp and pretension, and in which the author cavils
very keenly at Kepler and Brahe. We may judge of the impression made
upon the astronomical world in general by these rival works, from the
account which our countryman Jeremy Horrox has given of their effect
on him. He had been seduced by the magnificent promises of Lansberg,
and the praises of his admirers, which are prefixed to the work, and
was persuaded that the common opinion which preferred Tycho and Kepler
to him was a prejudice. In 1636, however, he became acquainted with
Crabtree, another young <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page303">303</a></span> astronomer, who lived in the same part
of Lancashire. By him Horrox was warned that Lansberg was not to be
depended on; that his hypotheses were vicious, and his observations
falsified or forced into agreement with his theories. He then read the
works and adopted the opinions of Kepler; and after some hesitation
which he felt at the thought of attacking the object of his former
idolatry, he wrote a dissertation on the points of difference between
them. It appears that, at one time, he intended to offer himself as
the umpire who was to adjudge the prize of excellence among the three
rival theories of Longomontanus, Kepler, and Lansberg; and, in
allusion to the story of ancient mythology, his work was to have been
called <i>Paris Astronomicus</i>; we easily see that he would have
given the golden apple to the Keplerian goddess. Succeeding
observations confirmed his judgment: and the <i>Rudolphine Tables</i>,
thus published seventy-six years after the Prutenic, which were
founded on the doctrines of Copernicus, were for a long time those
universally used.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Application of the Elliptical Theory to
the Moon.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> reduction of the Moon’s motions to rule
was a harder task than the formation of planetary tables, if accuracy
was required; for the Moon’s motion is affected by an incredible
number of different and complex inequalities, which, till their law is
detected, appear to defy all theory. Still, however, progress was made
in this work. The most important advances were due to Tycho Brahe. In
addition to the first and second inequalities of the moon (the
<i>Equation of the Centre</i>, known very early, and the
<i>Evection</i>, which Ptolemy had discovered), Tycho proved that
there was another inequality, which he termed the <i>Variation</i>,<a
id="fnanchor45-5" href="#note45-5"><span
class="fnanchor">45</span></a> which depended on the moon’s position
with respect to the sun, and which at its maximum was forty minutes
and a half, about a quarter of the evection. He also perceived, though
not very distinctly, the necessity of another correction of the moon’s
place depending on the sun’s longitude, which has since been termed
the <i>Annual Equation</i>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note45-5"
href="#fnanchor45-5">45</a></span>  We have seen (<a
href="#v1page180">chap. iii.</a>), that Aboul-Wefa, in the tenth
century, had already noticed this inequality; but his discovery had
been entirely forgotten long before the time of Tycho, and has only
recently been brought again into notice.</div>
<p>These steps concerned the Longitude of the Moon; Tycho also made
important advances in the knowledge of the Latitude. The Inclination
of the Orbit had hitherto been assumed to be the same at all <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page304">304</a></span> times; and the motion
of the Node had been supposed uniform. He found that the inclination
increased and diminished by twenty minutes, according to the position
of the line of nodes; and that the nodes, though they regress upon the
whole, sometimes go forwards and sometimes go backwards.</p>
<p>Tycho’s discoveries concerning the moon are given in his
<i>Progymnasmata</i>, which was published in 1603, two years after the
author’s death. He represents the Moon’s motion in longitude by means
of certain combinations of epicycles and eccentrics. But after Kepler
had shown that such devices are to be banished from the planetary
system, it was impossible not to think of extending the elliptical
theory to the moon. Horrox succeeded in doing this; and in 1638 sent
this essay to his friend Crabtree. It was published in 1673, with the
numerical elements requisite for its application added by Flamsteed.
Flamsteed had also (in 1671&#8211;2) compared this theory with
observation, and found that it agreed far more nearly than the
<i>Philolaic Tables</i> of Bullialdus, or the <i>Carolinian Tables</i>
of Street (<i>Epilogus ad Tabulas</i>). Moreover Horrox, by making the
centre of the ellipse revolve in an epicycle, gave an explanation of
the evection, as well as of the equation of the centre.<a
id="fnanchor46-5" href="#note46-5"><span
class="fnanchor">46</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note46-5"
href="#fnanchor46-5">46</a></span> Horrox (<i>Horrockes</i> as he
himself spelt his name) gave a first sketch of his theory in letters
to his friend Crabtree in 1638: in which the variation of the
eccentricity is not alluded to. But in Crabtree’s letter to Gascoigne
in 1642, he gives Horrox’s rule concerning it; and Flamsteed in his
<i>Epilogue</i> to the Tables, published by Wallis along with Horrox’s
works in 1673, gave an explanation of the theory which made it amount
very nearly to a revolution of the centre of the ellipse in an
epicycle. Halley afterwards made a slight alteration; but hardly, I
think, enough to justify Newton’s assertion (<i>Princip.</i> Lib. iii.
Prop. 35, Schol.), “Halleius centrum ellipseos in epicyclo locavit.”
See Baily’s <i>Flamsteed</i>, p. 683.</div>
<p>Modern astronomers, by calculating the effects of the perturbing
forces of the solar system, and comparing their calculations with
observation, have added many new corrections or equations to those
known at the time of Horrox; and since the Motions of the heavenly
bodies were even then affected by these variations as yet undetected,
it is clear that the Tables of that time must have shown some errors
when compared with observation. These errors much perplexed
astronomers, and naturally gave rise to the question whether the
motions of the heavenly bodies really were exactly regular, or whether
they were not affected by accidents as little reducible to rule as
wind and weather. Kepler had held the opinion of the <em>casualty</em>
of such errors; but Horrox, far more philosophically, argues against
this opinion, though he <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page305">305</a></span> allows that he is much embarrassed by
the deviations. His arguments show a singularly clear and strong
apprehension of the features of the case, and their real import. He
says,<a id="fnanchor47-5" href="#note47-5"><span
class="fnanchor">47</span></a> “these errors of the tables are
alternately in excess and defect; how could this constant compensation
happen if they were casual? Moreover, the alternation from excess to
defect is most rapid in the Moon, most slow in Jupiter and Saturn, in
which planets the error continues sometimes for years. If the errors
were casual, why should they not last as long in the Moon as in
Saturn? But if we suppose the tables to be right in the mean motions,
but wrong in the equations, these facts are just what must happen;
since Saturn’s inequalities are of long period, while those of the
Moon are numerous, and rapidly changing.” It would be impossible, at
the present moment, to reason better on this subject; and the
doctrine, that all the apparent irregularities of the celestial
motions are really regular, was one of great consequence to establish
at this period of the science.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Causes of the further Progress of
Astronomy.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">We</span> are now arrived at the time when theory
and observation sprang forwards with emulous energy. The physical
theories of Kepler, and the reasonings of other defenders of the
Copernican theory, led inevitably, after some vagueness and
perplexity, to a sound science of Mechanics; and this science in time
gave a new face to Astronomy. But in the mean time, while mechanical
mathematicians were generalizing from the astronomy already
established, astronomers were accumulating new facts, which pointed
the way to new theories and new generalizations. Copernicus, while he
had established the permanent length of the year, had confirmed the
motion of the sun’s apogee, and had shown that the eccentricity of the
earth’s orbit, and the obliquity of the ecliptic, were gradually,
though slowly, diminishing. Tycho had accumulated a store of excellent
observations. These, as well as the laws of the motions of the moon
and planets already explained, were materials on which the Mechanics
of the Universe was afterwards to employ its most matured powers. In
the mean time, the telescope had opened other new subjects of notice
and speculation; not only confirming the Copernican doctrine by the
phases of Venus, and the analogical examples of Jupiter and Saturn,
which with their Satellites <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page306">306</a></span> appeared like models of the Solar
System; but disclosing unexpected objects, as the Ring of Saturn, and
the Spots of the Sun. The art of observing made rapid advances, both
by the use of the telescope, and by the sounder notions of the
construction of instruments which Tycho introduced. Copernicus had
laughed at Rheticus, when he was disturbed about single minutes; and
declared that if he could be sure to ten minutes of space, he should
be as much delighted as Pythagoras was when he discovered the property
of the right-angled triangle. But Kepler founded the revolution which
he introduced on a quantity less than this. “Since,” he says,<a
id="fnanchor48-5" href="#note48-5"><span
class="fnanchor">48</span></a> “the Divine Goodness has given us in
Tycho an observer so exact that this error of eight minutes is
impossible, we must be thankful to God for this, and turn it to
account. And these eight minutes, which we must not neglect, will, of
themselves, enable us to reconstruct the whole of astronomy.” In
addition to other improvements, the art of numerical calculation made
an inestimable advance by means of Napier’s invention of Logarithms;
and the progress of other parts of pure mathematics was proportional
to the calls which astronomy and physics made upon them.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note48-5"
href="#fnanchor48-5">48</a></span> <i>De Stellâ Martis</i>, c.
19.</div>
<p>The exactness which observation had attained enabled astronomers
both to verify and improve the existing theories, and to study the yet
unsystematized facts. The science was, therefore, forced along by a
strong impulse on all sides, and its career assumed a new character.
Up to this point, the history of European Astronomy was only the
sequel of the history of Greek Astronomy; for the heliocentric system,
as we have seen, had had a place among the guesses, at least, of the
inventive and acute intellects of the Greek philosophers. But the
discovery of Kepler’s Laws, accompanied, as from the first they were,
with a conviction that the relations thus brought to light were the
effects and exponents of physical causes, led rapidly and irresistibly
to the Mechanical Science of the skies, and collaterally, to the
Mechanical Science of the other parts of Nature: Sound, and Light, and
Heat; and Magnetism, and Electricity, and Chemistry. The history of
these Sciences, thus treated, forms the sequel of the present work,
and will be the subject of the succeeding volumes. And since, as I
have said, our main object in this work is to deduce, from the history
of science, the philosophy of scientific discovery, it may be regarded
as fortunate for our purpose that the history, after this point, so
far changes its aspect as to offer new materials for such
speculations. The details of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page307">307</a></span> a history of astronomy, such as the
history of astronomy since Newton has been, though interesting to the
special lovers of that science, would be too technical, and the
features of the narrative too monotonous and unimpressive, to interest
the general reader, or to suggest a comprehensive philosophy of
science. But when we pass from the Ideas of Space and Time to the
Ideas of Force and Matter, of Mediums by which action and sensation
are produced, and of the Intimate Constitution of material bodies, we
have new fields of inquiry opened to us. And when we find that in
these fields, as well as in astronomy, there are large and striking
trains of unquestioned discovery to be narrated, we may gird ourselves
afresh to the task of writing, and I hope, of reading, the remaining
part of the History of the Inductive Sciences, in the trust that it
will in some measure help us to answer the important questions, What
is Truth? and, How is it to be discovered?</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">WE</span> enter now upon a new region
of the human mind. In passing from Astronomy to Mechanics we make a
transition from the <em>formal</em> to the <em>physical</em>
sciences;&#8212;from time and space to force and matter;&#8212;from
<em>phenomena</em> to <em>causes</em>. Hitherto we have been concerned
only with the paths and orbits, the periods and cycles, the angles and
distances, of the objects to which our sciences applied, namely, the
heavenly bodies. How these motions are produced;&#8212;by what
agencies, impulses, powers, they are determined to be what they
are;&#8212;of what nature are the objects themselves;&#8212;are
speculations which we have hitherto not dwelt upon. The history of
such speculations now comes before us; but, in the first place, we
must consider the history of speculations concerning motion in
general, terrestrial as well as celestial. We must first attend to
Mechanics, and afterwards return to Physical Astronomy.</p>
<p>In the same way in which the development of Pure Mathematics, which
began with the Greeks, was a necessary condition of the progress of
Formal Astronomy, the creation of the science of Mechanics now became
necessary to the formation and progress of Physical Astronomy.
Geometry and Mechanics were studied for their own sakes; but they also
supplied ideas, language, and reasoning to other sciences. If the
Greeks had not cultivated Conic Sections, Kepler could not have
superseded Ptolemy; if the Greeks had cultivated Dynamics,<a
id="fnanchor1-6" href="#note1-6"><span class="fnanchor">1</span></a>
Kepler might have anticipated Newton.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-6"

<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Prelude to the Science of
Statics.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">SOME</span> steps in the science of
Motion, or rather in the science of Equilibrium, had been made by the
ancients, as we have seen. Archimedes established satisfactorily the
doctrine of the Lever, some important properties of the Centre of
Gravity, and the fundamental proposition of Hydrostatics. But this
beginning led to no permanent progress. Whether the distinction
between the principles of the doctrine of Equilibrium and of Motion
was clearly seen by Archimedes, we do not know; but it never was
caught hold of by any of the other writers of antiquity, or by those
of the Stationary Period. What was still worse, the point which
Archimedes had won was not steadily maintained.</p>
<p>We have given some <a href="#v1page81">examples</a> of the general
ignorance of the Greek philosophers on such subjects, in noticing the
strange manner in which Aristotle refers to mathematical properties,
in order to account for the equilibrium of a lever, and the attitude
of a man rising from a chair. And we have seen, in <a
href="#v1page188">speaking</a> of the indistinct ideas of the
Stationary Period, that the attempts which were made to extend the
statical doctrine of Archimedes, failed, in such a manner as to show
that his followers had not clearly apprehended the idea on which his
reasoning altogether depended. The clouds which he had, for a moment,
cloven in his advance, closed after him, and the former dimness and
confusion settled again on the land.</p>
<p>This dimness and confusion, with respect to all subjects of
mechanical reasoning, prevailed still, at the period we now have to
consider; namely, the period of the first promulgation of the
Copernican opinions. This is so important a point that I must
illustrate it further.</p>
<p>Certain general notions of the connection of cause and effect in
motion, exist in the human mind at all periods of its development, and
are implied in the formation of language and in the most familiar
employments of men’s thoughts. But these do not constitute a
<em>science</em> of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page313">313</a></span> Mechanics, any more than the notions of
<i>square</i> and <i>round</i> make a Geometry, or the notions of
<i>months</i> and <i>years</i> make an Astronomy. The unfolding these
Notions into distinct Ideas, on which can be founded principles and
reasonings, is further requisite, in order to produce a science; and,
with respect to the doctrines of Motion, this was long in coming to
pass; men’s thoughts remained long entangled in their primitive and
unscientific confusion.</p>
<p>We may mention one or two features of this confusion, such as we
find in authors belonging to the period now under review.</p>
<p>We have <a href="#v1page71">already</a>, in speaking of the Greek
School Philosophy, noticed the attempt to explain some of the
differences among Motions, by classifying them into Natural Motions
and Violent Motions; and we have spoken of the assertion that heavy
bodies fall quicker in proportion to their greater weight. These
doctrines were still retained: yet the views which they implied were
essentially erroneous and unsound; for they did not refer distinctly
to a measurable Force as the cause of all motion or change of motion;
and they confounded the causes which <em>produce</em> and those which
<em>preserve</em>, motion. Hence such principles did not lead
immediately to any advance of knowledge, though efforts were made to
apply them, in the cases both of terrestrial Mechanics and of the
motions of the heavenly bodies.</p>
<p>The effect of the Inclined Plane was one of the first, as it was
one of the most important, propositions, on which modern writers
employed themselves. It was found that a body, when supported on a
sloping surface, might be sustained or raised by a force or exertion
which would not have been able to sustain or raise it without such
support. And hence, <i>The Inclined Plane</i> was placed in the list
of Mechanical Powers, or simple machines by which the efficacy of
forces is increased: the question was, in what proportion this
increase of efficiency takes place. It is easily seen that the force
requisite to sustain a body is smaller, as the slope on which it rests
is smaller; Cardan (whose work, <i>De Proportionibus Numerorum,
Motuum, Ponderum,</i> &amp;c., was published in 1545) asserts that the
force is double when the angle of inclination is double, and so on for
other proportions; this is probably a guess, and is an erroneous one.
Guido Ubaldi, of Marchmont, published at Pesaro, in 1577, a work which
he called <i>Mechanicorum Liber</i>, in which he endeavors to prove
that an acute wedge will produce a greater mechanical effect than an
obtuse one, without determining in what proportion. There is, he
observes, “a certain repugnance” between the direction in which the
side of the wedge tends to <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page314">314</a></span> move the obstacle, and the direction in
which it really does move. Thus the Wedge and the Inclined Plane are
connected in principle. He also refers the Screw to the Inclined Plane
and the Wedge, in a manner which shows a just apprehension of the
question. Benedetti (1585) treats the Wedge in a different manner; not
exact, but still showing some powers of thought on mechanical
subjects. Michael Varro, whose <i>Tractatus de Motu</i> was published
at Geneva in 1584, deduces the wedge from the composition of
hypothetical motions, in a way which may appear to some persons an
anticipation of the doctrine of the Composition of Forces.</p>
<p>There is another work on subjects of this kind, of which several
editions were published in the sixteenth century, and which treats
this matter in nearly the same way as Varro, and in favour of which a
claim has been made<a id="fnanchor2-6" href="#note2-6"><span
class="fnanchor">2</span></a> (I think an unfounded one), as if it
contained the true principle of this problem. The work is “Jordanus
Nemorarius <i>De Ponderositate</i>.” The date and history of this
author were probably even then unknown; for in 1599, Benedetti,
correcting some of the errors of Tartalea, says they are taken “a
Jordano quodam antiquo.” The book was probably a kind of school-book,
and much used; for an edition printed at Frankfort, in 1533, is stated
to be <i>Cum gratia et privilegio Imperiali, Petro Apiano mathematico
Ingolstadiano ad xxx annos concesso</i>. But this edition does not
contain the Inclined Plane. Though those who compiled the work assert
in words something like the inverse proportion of Weights and their
Velocities, they had not learnt at that time how to apply this maxim
to the Inclined Plane; nor were they ever able to render a sound
reason for it. In the edition of Venice, 1565, however, such an
application is attempted. The reasonings are founded on the
Aristotelian assumption, “that bodies descend more quickly in
proportion as they are heavier.” To this principle are added some
others; as, that “a body is heavier in proportion as it descends more
directly to the centre,” and that, in proportion as a body descends
more obliquely, the intercepted part of the direct descent is smaller.
By means of these principles, the “descending force” of bodies, on
inclined planes, was compared, by a process, which, so far as it forms
a line of proof at all, is a somewhat curious example of confused and
vicious reasoning. When two bodies are supported on two inclined
planes, and are connected by a string passing over the junction of the
planes, so that when one descends the other ascends, <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page315">315</a></span> they must move
through equal spaces on the planes; but on the plane which is more
oblique (that is, more nearly horizontal), the vertical descent will
be smaller in the same proportion in which the plane is longer. Hence,
by the Aristotelian principle, the weight of the body on the longer
plane is less; and, to produce an equality of effect, the body must be
greater in the same proportion. We may observe that the Aristotelian
principle is not only false, but is here misapplied; for its genuine
meaning is, that when bodies <em>fall freely</em> by gravity, they
move quicker in proportion as they are heavier; but the rule is here
applied to the motions which bodies <em>would</em> have, if they were
moved by a force extraneous to their gravity. The proposition was
supposed by the Aristotelians to be true of <em>actual</em>
velocities; it is applied by Jordanus to <em>virtual</em> velocities,
without his being aware what he was doing. This confusion being made,
the result is got at by taking for granted that bodies <em>thus</em>
proved to be equally <em>heavy</em>, have equal powers of descent on
the inclined planes; whereas, in the previous part of the reasoning,
the weight was supposed to be proportional to the descent in the
vertical direction. It is obvious, in all this, that though the author
had adopted the false Aristotelian principle, he had not settled in
his own mind whether the motions of which it spoke were actual or
virtual motions;&#8212;motions in the direction of the inclined plane,
or of the intercepted parts of the vertical, corresponding to these;
nor whether the “descending force” of a body was something different
from its weight. We cannot doubt that, if he had been required to
point out, with any exactness, the cases to which his reasoning
applied, he would have been unable to do so; not possessing any of
those clear fundamental Ideas of Pressure and Force, on which alone
any real knowledge on such subjects must depend. The whole of
Jordanus’s reasoning is an example of the confusion of thought of his
period, and of nothing more. It no more supplied the want of some man
of genius, who should give the subject a real scientific foundation,
than Aristotle’s knowledge of the proportion of the weights on the
lever superseded the necessity of Archimedes’s proof of it.</p>

href="#fnanchor2-6">2</a></span> Mr. Drinkwater’s <i>Life of
Galileo</i>, in the Lib. Usef. Kn. p. 83.</div>
<p>We are not, therefore, to wonder that, though this pretended
theorem was copied by other writers, as by Tartalea, in his <i>Quesiti
et Inventioni Diversi</i>, published in 1554, no progress was made in
the real solution of any one mechanical problem by means of it. Guido
Ubaldi, who, in 1577, writes in such a manner as to show that he had
taken a good hold of his subject for his time, refers to Pappus’s
solution of the problem of the Inclined Plane,  but makes no mention
of that of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page316">316</a></span>
Jordanus and Tartalea.<a id="fnanchor3-6" href="#note3-6"><span
class="fnanchor">3</span></a> No progress was likely to occur, till
the mathematicians had distinctly recovered the genuine Idea of
Pressure, as a Force producing equilibrium, which Archimedes had
possessed, and which was soon to reappear in Stevinus.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note3-6"
href="#fnanchor3-6">3</a></span> Ubaldi mentions and blames Jordanus’s
way of treating the Lever. (See his Preface.)</div>
<p>The properties of the Lever had always continued known to
mathematicians, although, in the dark period, the superiority of the
proof given by Archimedes had not been recognized. We are not to be
surprised, if reasonings like those of Jordanus were applied to
demonstrate the theories of the Lever with apparent success. Writers
on Mechanics were, as we have seen, so vacillating in their mode of
dealing with words and propositions, that their maxims could be made
to prove any thing which was already known to be true.</p>
<p>We proceed to speak of the beginning of the real progress of
Mechanics in modern times.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Revival of the Scientific Idea of
Pressure.&#8212;Stevinus.&#8212;Equilibrium of Oblique
Forces.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> doctrine of the Centre of Gravity was
the part of the mechanical speculations of Archimedes which was most
diligently prosecuted after his time. Pappus and others, among the
ancients, had solved some new problems on this subject, and
Commandinus, in 1565, published <i>De Centro Gravitatis Solidorum</i>.
Such treatises contained, for the most part, only mathematical
consequences of the doctrines of Archimedes; but the mathematicians
also retained a steady conviction of the mechanical property of the
Centre of Gravity, namely, that all the weight of the body might be
collected there, without any change in the mechanical results; a
conviction which is closely connected with our fundamental conceptions
of mechanical action. Such a principle, also, will enable us to
determine the result of many simple mechanical arrangements; for
instance, if a mathematician of those days had been asked whether a
solid ball could be made of such a form, that, when placed on a
horizontal plane, it should go on rolling forwards without limit
merely by the effect of its own weight, he would probably have
answered, that it could not; for that the centre of gravity of the
ball would seek the lowest position it could find, and that, when it
had found this, the ball could have no tendency to roll any further.
And, in making this assertion, the supposed reasoner would not be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page317">317</a></span> anticipating
any wider proof of the impossibility of a <i>perpetual motion</i>
drawn from principles subsequently discovered, but would be referring
the question to certain fundamental convictions, which, whether put
into Axioms or not, inevitably accompany our mechanical
conceptions.</p>
<p>In the same way, Stevinus of Bruges, in 1586, when he published his
<i>Beghinselen der Waaghconst</i> (Principles of Equilibrium), had
been asked why a loop of chain, hung over a triangular beam, could
not, as he asserted it could not, go on moving round and round
perpetually, by the action of its own weight, he would probably have
answered, that the weight of the chain, if it produced motion at all,
must have a tendency to bring it into some certain position, and that
when the chain had reached this position, it would have no tendency to
go any further; and thus he would have reduced the impossibility of
such a perpetual motion, to the conception of gravity, as a force
tending to produce equilibrium; a principle perfectly sound and
correct.</p>
<p>Upon this principle thus applied, Stevinus did establish the
fundamental property of the Inclined Plane. He supposed a loop of
string, loaded with fourteen equal balls at equal distances, to hang
over a triangular support which was composed of two inclined planes
with a horizontal base, and whose sides, being unequal in the
proportion of two to one, supported four and two balls respectively.
He showed that this loop must hang at rest, because any motion would
only bring it into the same condition in which it was at first; and
that the festoon of eight balls which hung down below the triangle
might be removed without disturbing the equilibrium; so that four
balls on the longer plane would balance two balls on the shorter
plane; or in other words, the weights would be as the lengths of the
planes intercepted by the horizontal line.</p>
<p>Stevinus showed his firm possession of the truth contained in this
principle, by deducing from it the properties of forces acting in
oblique directions under all kinds of conditions; in short, he showed
his entire ability to found upon it a complete doctrine of
equilibrium; and upon his foundations, and without any additional
support, the mathematical doctrines of Statics might have been carried
to the highest pitch of perfection they have yet reached. The
formation of the science was finished; the mathematical development
and exposition of it were alone open to extension and change.</p>
<p>[2d Ed.] [“Simon Stevin of Bruges,” as he usually designates
himself in the title-page of his work, has lately become an object of
general interest in his own country, and it has been resolved to erect
a <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page318">318</a></span> statue in
honor of him in one of the public places of his native city. He was
born in 1548, as I learn from M. Quetelet’s notice of him, and died in
1620. Montucla says that he died in 1633; misled apparently by the
preface to Albert Girard’s edition of Stevin’s works, which was
published in 1634, and which speaks of a death which took place in the
preceding year; but on examination it will be seen that this refers to
Girard, not to Stevin.</p>
<p>I ought to have mentioned, in consideration of the importance of
the proposition, that Stevin distinctly states the <i>triangle of
forces</i>; namely, that three forces which act upon a point are in
equilibrium when they are parallel and proportional to the three sides
of any plane triangle. This includes the principle of the
<i>Composition of Statical Forces</i>. Stevin also applies his
principle of equilibrium to cordage, pulleys, funicular polygons, and
especially to the bits of bridles; a branch of mechanics which he
calls <i>Chalinothlipsis</i>.</p>
<p>He has also the merit of having seen very clearly, the distinction
of statical and dynamical problems. He remarks that the question,
“What force will <em>support</em> a loaded wagon on an inclined plane?
is a statical question, depending on simple conditions; but that the
question, What force will <em>move</em> the wagon? requires additional
considerations to be introduced.</p>
<p>In <a href="#b6-4">Chapter iv.</a> of this Book, I have noticed
Stevin’s share in the rediscovery of the <i>Laws of the Equilibrium of
Fluids</i>. He distinctly explains the <i>hydrostatic paradox</i>, of
which the discovery is generally ascribed to Pascal.</p>
<p>Earlier than Stevinus, Leonardo da Vinci must have a place among
the discoverers of the Conditions of Equilibrium of Oblique Forces. He
published no work on this subject; but extracts from his manuscripts
have been published by Venturi, in his <i>Essai sur les Ouvrages
Physico-Mathematiques de Leonard da Vinci, avec des Fragmens tirés de
ses Manuscrits apportés d’Italie</i>, Paris, 1797: and by Libri, in
his <i>Hist. des Sc. Math. en Italie</i>, 1839. I have also myself
examined these manuscripts in the Royal Library at Paris.</p>
<p>It appears that, as early as 1499, Leonardo gave a perfectly
correct statement of the proportion of the forces exerted by a cord
which acts obliquely and supports a weight on a lever. He
distinguishes between the real lever, and the <i>potential levers</i>,
that is, the perpendiculars drawn from the centre upon the directions
of the forces. This is quite sound and satisfactory. These views must
in all probability have been sufficiently promulgated in Italy to
influence the speculations of Galileo; <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page319">319</a></span> whose reasonings respecting the lever
much resemble those of Leonardo.&#8212;Da Vinci also anticipated
Galileo in <em>asserting</em> that the time of descent of a body down
an inclined plane is to the time of descent down its vertical length
in the proportion of the length of the plane to the height. But this
cannot, I think, have been more than a guess: there is no vestige of a
proof given.]</p>
<p>The contemporaneous progress of the other branch of mechanics, the
Doctrine of Motion, interfered with this independent advance of
Statics; and to that we must now turn. We may observe, however, that
true propositions respecting the composition of forces appear to have
rapidly diffused themselves. The <i>Tractatus de Motu</i> of Michael
Varro of Geneva, already noticed, printed in 1584, had asserted, that
the forces which balance each other, acting on the sides of a
right-angled triangular wedge, are in the proportion of the sides of
the triangle; and although this assertion does not appear to have been
derived from a distinct idea of pressure, the author had hence rightly
deduced the properties of the wedge and the screw. And shortly after
this time, Galileo also established the same results on different
principles. In his Treatise <i>Delle Scienze Mecaniche</i> (1592), he
refers the Inclined Plane to the Lever, in a sound and nearly
satisfactory manner; imagining a lever so placed, that the motion of a
body at the extremity of one of its arms should be in the same
direction as it is upon the plane. A slight modification makes this an
unexceptionable proof.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Prelude to the Science of
Dynamics.&#8212;Attempts at the First Law of Motion.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">We</span> have already <a
href="#v1page71">seen</a>, that Aristotle divided Motions into Natural
and Violent. Cardan endeavored to improve this division by making
three classes: <i>Voluntary</i> Motion, which is circular and uniform,
and which is intended to include the celestial motions; <i>Natural</i>
Motion, which is stronger towards the end, as the motion of a falling
body,&#8212;this is in a straight line, because it is motion to an
end, and nature seeks her ends by the shortest road; and thirdly,
<i>Violent</i> Motion, including in this term all kinds different from
the former two. Cardan was aware that such Violent Motion might be
produced by a very small force; thus he asserts, that a spherical body
resting on a horizontal plane may be put in motion by any force which
is sufficient to cleave the air; for which, however, he erroneously
assigns as a reason, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page320">320</a></span> the smallness of the point of contact.<a
id="fnanchor4-6" href="#note4-6"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a>
But the most common mistake of this period was, that of supposing that
as force is requisite to move a body, so a perpetual supply of force
is requisite to keep it in motion. The whole of what Kepler called his
“physical” reasoning, depended upon this assumption. He endeavored to
discover the forces by which the motions of the planets about the sun
might be produced; but, in all cases, he considered the velocity of
the planet as produced by, and exhibiting the effect of, a force which
acted in the direction of the motion. Kepler’s essays, which are in
this respect so feeble and unmeaning, have sometimes been considered
as disclosing some distant anticipation of Newton’s discovery of the
existence and law of central forces. There is, however, in reality, no
other connection between these speculations than that which arises
from the use of the term <i>force</i> by the two writers in two
utterly different meanings. Kepler’s Forces were certain imaginary
qualities which appeared in the actual motion which the bodies had;
Newton’s Forces were causes which appeared by the change of motion:
Kepler’s Forces urged the bodies forwards; Newton’s deflected the
bodies from such a progress. If Kepler’s Forces were destroyed, the
body would instantly stop; if Newton’s were annihilated, the body
would go on uniformly in a straight line. Kepler compares the action
of his Forces to the way in which a body might be driven round, by
being placed among the sails of a windmill; Newton’s Forces would be
represented by a rope pulling the body to the centre. Newton’s Force
is merely mutual attraction; Kepler’s is something quite different
from this; for though he perpetually illustrates his views by the
example of a magnet, he warns us that the sun differs from the magnet
in this respect, that its force is not attractive, but directive.<a
id="fnanchor5-6" href="#note5-6"><span class="fnanchor">5</span></a>
Kepler’s essays may with considerable reason be asserted to be an
anticipation of the Vortices of Descartes; but they can with no
propriety whatever be said to anticipate Newton’s Dynamical
Theory.</p>

<p>The confusion of thought which prevented mathematicians from seeing
the difference between producing and preserving motion, was, indeed,
fatal to all attempts at progress on this subject. We have already  <a
href="#v1page71">noticed</a> the perplexity in which Aristotle
involved himself, by his endeavors to find a reason for the continued
motion of a stone <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page321">321</a></span> after the moving power had ceased to
act; and that he had ascribed it to the effect of the air or other
medium in which the stone moves. Tartalea, whose <i>Nuova Scienza</i>
is dated 1550, though a good <em>pure</em> mathematician, is still
quite in the dark on mechanical matters. One of his propositions, in
the work just mentioned, is (B. i. Prop. 3), “The more a heavy body
recedes from the beginning, or approaches the end of violent motion,
the slower and more inertly it goes;” which he applies to the
horizontal motion of projectiles. In like manner most other writers
about this period conceived that a cannon-ball goes forwards till it
loses all its projectile motion, and then falls downwards. Benedetti,
who has already been mentioned, must be considered as one of the first
enlightened opponents of this and other Aristotelian errors or
puzzles. In his <i>Speculationum Liber</i> (Venice, 1585), he opposes
Aristotle’s mechanical opinions, with great expressions of respect,
but in a very sweeping manner. His chapter xxiv. is headed, “Whether
this eminent man was right in his opinion concerning violent and
natural motion.” And after stating the Aristotelian opinion just
mentioned, that the body is impelled by the air, he says that the air
must impede rather than impel the body, and that<a id="fnanchor6-6"
href="#note6-6"><span class="fnanchor">6</span></a> “the motion of the
body, separated from the mover, arises by a certain natural impression
from the impetuosity (<i>ex impetuositate</i>) received from the
mover.” He adds, that in natural motions this <i>impetuosity</i>
continually increases by the continued action of the
cause,&#8212;namely, the propension of going to the place assigned it
by nature; and that thus the velocity increases as the body moves from
the beginning of its path. This statement shows a clearness of
conception with regard to the cause of accelerated motion, which
Galileo himself was long in acquiring.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note6-6"
href="#fnanchor6-6">6</a></span> P. 184.</div>
<p>Though Benedetti was thus on the way to the First Law of
Motion,&#8212;that all motion is uniform and rectilinear, except so
far as it is affected by extraneous forces;&#8212;this Law was not
likely to be either generally conceived, or satisfactorily proved,
till the other Laws of Motion, by which the action of Forces is
regulated, had come into view. Hence, though a partial apprehension of
this principle had preceded the discovery of the Laws of Motion, we
must place the establishment of the principle in the period when those
Laws were detected and established, the period of Galileo and his
followers. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page322">322</a></span></p>

<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Establishment of the First
Law of Motion.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">AFTER</span> mathematicians had begun
to doubt or reject the authority of Aristotle, they were still some
time in coming to the conclusion, that the distinction of Natural and
Violent Motions was altogether untenable;&#8212;that the velocity of a
body in motion increased or diminished in consequence of the action of
extrinsic causes, not of any property of the motion itself;&#8212;and
that the apparently universal fact, of bodies growing slower and
slower, as if by their own disposition, till they finally stopped,
from which Motions had been called Violent, arose from the action of
external obstacles not immediately obvious, as the friction and the
resistance of the air when a ball runs on the ground, and the action
of gravity, when it is thrown upwards. But the truth to which they
were at last led, was, that such causes would account for <em>all</em>
the diminution of velocity which bodies experience when apparently
left to themselves  and that without such causes, the motion of all
bodies would go on forever, in a straight line and with a uniform
velocity.</p>
<p>Who first announced this Law in a general form, it may be difficult
to point out; its exact or approximate truth was necessarily taken for
granted in all complete investigations on the subject of the laws of
motion of falling bodies, and of bodies projected so as to describe
curves. In Galileo’s first attempt to solve the problem of falling
bodies, he did not carry his analysis back to the notion of force, and
therefore this law does not appear. In 1604 he had an erroneous
opinion on this subject  and we do not know when he was led to the
true doctrine which he published in his <i>Discorso</i>, in 1638. In
his third Dialogue he gives the instance of water in a vessel, for the
purpose of showing that circular motion has a tendency to continue.
And in his first Dialogue on the Copernican System<a id="fnanchor7-6"
href="#note7-6"><span class="fnanchor">7</span></a> (published in
1630), he asserts <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page323">323</a></span> Circular Motion alone to be naturally
uniform, and retains the distinction between Natural and Violent
Motion. In the <i>Dialogues on Mechanics</i>, however, published in
1638, but written apparently at an earlier period, in treating of
Projectiles,<a id="fnanchor8-6" href="#note8-6"><span
class="fnanchor">8</span></a> he asserts the true Law. “Mobile super
planum horizontale projectum mente concipio omni secluso impedimento;
jam constat ex his quæ fusius alibi dicta sunt, illius motum equabilem
et perpetuum super ipso plano futurum esse, si planum in infinitum
extendatur.” “Conceive a movable body upon a horizontal plane, and
suppose all obstacles to motion to be removed; it is then manifest,
from what has been said more at large in another place, that the
body’s motion will be uniform and perpetual upon the plane, if the
plane be indefinitely extended.” His pupil Borelli, in 1667 (in the
treatise <i>De Vi Percussionis</i>), states the proposition generally,
that “Velocity is, by its nature, uniform, and perpetual;” and this
opinion appears to have been, at that time, generally diffused, as we
find evidence in Wallis and others. It is commonly said that Descartes
was the first to state this generally. His <i>Principia</i> were
published in 1644; but his proofs of this First Law of Motion are
rather of a theological than of a mechanical kind. His reason for this
Law is,<a id="fnanchor9-6" href="#note9-6"><span
class="fnanchor">9</span></a> “the immutability and simplicity of the
operation by which God preserves motion in matter. For he only
preserves it precisely as it is in that moment in which he preserves
it, taking no account of that which may have been previously.”
Reasoning of this abstract and <i>à priori</i> kind, though it may be
urged in favor of true opinions after they have been inductively
established, is almost equally capable of being called in on the side
of error, as we have seen in the case of Aristotle’s philosophy. We
ought not, however, to forget that the reference to these abstract and
<i>à priori</i> principles is an indication of the absolute
universality and necessity which we look for in complete Sciences, and
a result of those faculties by which such Science is rendered
possible, and suitable to man’s intellectual nature.</p>

<p>The induction by which the First Law of Motion is established,
consists, as induction consists in all cases, in conceiving clearly
the Law, and in perceiving the subordination of Facts to it. But the
Law speaks of bodies not acted upon by any external force,&#8212;a
case which never occurs in fact; and the difficulty of the step
consisted in bringing all the common cases in which motion is
gradually extinguished, under the notion of the action of a retarding
force. In order to do this, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page324">324</a></span> Hooke and others showed that, by
diminishing the obvious resistances, the retardation also became less;
and men were gradually led to a distinct appreciation of the
Resistance, Friction, &amp;c., which, in all terrestrial motions,
prevent the Law from being evident; and thus they at last established
by experiment a Law which cannot be experimentally exemplified. The
natural uniformity of motion was proved by examining all kinds of
cases in which motion was not uniform. Men culled the abstract Rule
out of the concrete Experiment; although the Rule was, in every case,
mixed with other Rules, and each Rule could be collected from the
Experiment only by supposing the others known. The perfect simplicity
which we necessarily seek for in a law of nature, enables us to
disentangle the complexity which this combination appears at first
sight to occasion.</p>
<p>The First Law of Motion asserts that the motion of a body, when
left to itself will not only be uniform, but rectilinear also. This
latter part of the law is indeed obvious of itself as soon as we
conceive a body detached from all special reference to external points
and objects. Yet, as we have seen, Galileo asserted that the naturally
uniform motion of bodies was that which takes place in a circle.
Benedetti, however, in 1585, had entertained sound notions on this
subject. In commenting on Aristotle’s question, why we obtain an
advantage in throwing by using a sling, he says,<a id="fnanchor10-6"
href="#note10-6"><span class="fnanchor">10</span></a> that the body,
when whirled round, tends to go on in a straight line. In Galileo’s
second Dialogue, he makes one of his interlocutors (Simplicio), when
appealed to on this subject, after thinking intently for a little
while, give the same opinion; and the principle is, from this time,
taken for granted by the authors who treat of the motion of
projectiles. Descartes, as might be supposed, gives the same reason
for this as for the other part of the law, namely, the immutability of
the Deity.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Formation and Application of the Notion
of Accelerating Force.&#8212;Laws of Falling Bodies.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">We</span> have seen how rude and vague were the
attempts of Aristotle and his followers to obtain a philosophy of
bodies falling downwards or thrown in any direction. If the First Law
of Motion had been clearly known, it would then, perhaps, have been
seen that the way to understand and analyze the motion of any body, is
to consider the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page325">325</a></span>
Causes of <em>change</em> of motion which at each instant operate upon
it; and thus men would have been led to the notion of Accelerating
Forces, that is, Forces which act upon bodies already in motion, and
accelerate, retard, or deflect their motions. It was, however, only
after many attempts that they reached this point. They began by
considering the <em>whole motion</em> with reference to certain
ill-defined abstract Notions, instead of considering, with a clear
apprehension of the conditions of Causation, the <em>successive
parts</em> of which the motion consists. Thus, they spoke of the
tendency of bodies to the Centre, or to their Own Place;&#8212;of
Projecting Force, of Impetus, of Retraction;&#8212;with little or no
profit to knowledge. The indistinctness of their notions may, perhaps,
be judged of from their speculations concerning projectiles.
Santbach,<a id="fnanchor11-6" href="#note11-6"><span
class="fnanchor">11</span></a> in 1561, imagined that a body thrown
with great velocity, as, for instance, a ball from a cannon, went in a
straight line till all its velocity was exhausted, and then fell
directly downwards. He has written a treatise on gunnery, founded on
this absurd assumption. To this succeeded another doctrine, which,
though not much more philosophical than the former, agreed much better
with the phenomena. Nicolo Tartalea (<i>Nuova Scienza</i>, Venice,
1550; <i>Quesiti et Inventioni Diversi</i>, 1554) and <span
class="correction" title="emended from Gualtier">Gualter</span> Rivius
(<i>Architectura</i>, &amp;c., Basil, 1582) represented the path of a
cannon-ball as consisting, first of a straight line in the direction
of the original projection, then of an arc of a circle in which it
went on till its motion became vertical downwards, and then of a
vertical line in which it continued to fall. The latter of these
writers, however, was aware that the path must, from the first, be a
curve; and treated it as a straight line, only because the curvature
is very slight. Even Santbach’s figure represents the path of the ball
as partially descending before its final fall, but then it descends by
<em>steps</em>, not in a curve. Santbach, therefore, did not conceive
the <em>Composition</em> of the effect of gravity with the existing
motion, but supposed them to act alternately; Rivius, however,
understood this Composition, and saw that gravity must act as a
deflecting force at every point of the path. Galileo, in his second
Dialogue,<a id="fnanchor12-6" href="#note12-6"><span
class="fnanchor">12</span></a> makes Simplicius come to the same
conclusion. “Since,” he says, “there is nothing to support the body,
when it quits that which projects it, it cannot be but that its proper
gravity must operate,” and it must immediately begin to decline
downwards.</p>

href="#fnanchor12-6">12</a></span> P. 147.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page326">326</a></span> The Force of
Gravity which thus produces deflection and curvature in the path of a
body thrown <em>obliquely</em>, constantly increases the velocity of a
body when it falls <em>vertically</em> downwards. The universality of
this increase was obvious, both from reasoning and in fact; the law of
it could only be discovered by closer consideration; and the full
analysis of the problem required a distinct measure of the quantity of
Accelerating Force. Galileo, who first solved this problem, began by
viewing it as a question of fact, but conjectured the solution by
taking for granted that the rule must be the simplest possible.
“Bodies,” he says,<a id="fnanchor13-6" href="#note13-6"><span
class="fnanchor">13</span></a> “will fall in the most simple way,
because Natural Motions are always the most simple. When a stone
falls, if we consider the matter attentively, we shall find that there
is no addition, no increase, of the velocity more simple than that
which is always added in the same manner,” that is, when equal
additions take place in equal times; “which we shall easily understand
if we attend to the close connection of motion and time.” From this
Law, thus assumed, he deduced that the spaces described from the
beginning of the motion must be as the squares of the times; and,
again, assuming that the laws of descent for balls rolling down
inclined planes, must be the same as for bodies falling freely, he
verified this conclusion by experiment.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note13-6"
href="#fnanchor13-6">13</a></span> <i>Dial. Sc.</i> iv. p. 91.</div>
<p>It will, perhaps, occur to the reader that this argument, from the
simplicity of the assumed law, is somewhat insecure. It is not always
easy for us to discern what that greatest simplicity is, which nature
adopts in her laws. Accordingly, Galileo was led wrong by this way of
viewing the subject before he was led right. He at first supposed,
that the Velocity which the body had acquired at any point must be
proportional to the <em>Space</em> described from the point where the
motion began. This false law is as simple in its enunciation as the
true law, that the Velocity is proportional to the <em>Time</em>: it
had been asserted as the true law by M. Varro (<i>De Motu
Tractatus</i>, Genevæ, 1584), and by Baliani, a gentleman of Genoa,
who published it in 1638. It was, however, soon rejected by Galileo,
though it was afterwards taken up and defended by Casræus, one of
Galileo’s opponents. It so happens, indeed, that the false law is not
only at variance with fact, but with itself: it involves a
mathematical self-contradiction. This circumstance, however, was
accidental: it would be easy to state laws of the increase of velocity
which should be simple, and yet false in fact, though quite possible
in their own nature. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page327">327</a></span></p>
<p>The Law of Velocity was hitherto, as we have seen, treated as a law
of phenomena, without reference to the Causes of the law. “The cause
of the acceleration of the motions of falling bodies is not,” Galileo
observes, “a necessary part of the investigation. Opinions are
different. Some refer it to the approach to the centre; others say
that there is a certain extension of the centrical medium, which,
closing behind the body, pushes it forwards. For the present, it is
enough for us to demonstrate certain properties of Accelerated Motion,
the acceleration being according to the very simple Law, that the
Velocity is proportional to the Time. And if we find that the
properties of such motion are verified by the motions of bodies
descending freely, we may suppose that the assumption agrees with the
laws of bodies falling freely by the action of gravity.”<a
id="fnanchor14-6" href="#note14-6"><span
class="fnanchor">14</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note14-6"
href="#fnanchor14-6">14</a></span> Gal. <i>Op.</i> iii. 91, 92.</div>
<p>It was, however, an easy step to conceive this acceleration as
caused by the continual action of Gravity. This account had already
been given by Benedetti, as we have seen. When it was once adopted,
Gravity was considered as a <i>constant</i> or <i>uniform</i> force;
on this point, indeed, the adherents of the law of Galileo and of that
of Casræus were agreed; but the question was, what <em>is</em> a
Uniform Force? The answer which Galileo was led to give was obviously
this;&#8212;<em>that</em> is a Uniform Force which generates equal
velocities in equal successive times; and this principle leads at once
to the doctrine, that Forces are to be compared by comparing the
Velocities generated by them in equal times.</p>
<p>Though, however, this was a consequence of the rule by which
Gravity is represented as a Uniform Force, the subject presents some
difficulty at first sight. It is not immediately obvious that we may
thus measure forces by the Velocity <em>added</em> in a given time,
without taking into account the velocity they have already. If we
communicate velocity to a body by the hand or by a spring, the effect
we produce in a second of time is lessened, when the body has already
a velocity which withdraws it from the pressure of the agent. But it
appears that this is not so in the case of gravity; the velocity added
in one second is the same, whatever downward motion the body already
possesses. A body falling from rest acquires a velocity, in one
second, of thirty-two feet; and if a cannon-ball were shot downwards
with a velocity of 1000 feet a second, it would equally, at the end of
one second, have received an accession of 32 feet to its velocity.</p>
<p>This conception of Gravity as a Uniform Force,&#8212;as constantly
and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page328">328</a></span> equally
<em>increasing</em> the velocity of a descending body,&#8212;will
become clear by a little attention; but it undoubtedly presents
difficulty at first. Accordingly, we find that Descartes did not
accept it. “It is certain,” he says, “that a stone is not equally
disposed to receive a new motion or increase of velocity when it is
already moving very quickly, and when it is moving slowly.”</p>
<p>Descartes showed, by other expressions, that he had not caught hold
of the true notion of accelerating force. Thus, he says in a letter to
Mersenne, “I am astonished at what you tell me, of having found, by
experiment, that bodies thrown up in the air take neither more nor
less time to rise than to fall again; and you will excuse me if I say
that I look upon the experiment as a very difficult one to make
accurately.” Yet it is clear from the Notion of a Constant Force that
(omitting the resistance of the air) this equality must take place;
for the Force which will gradually destroy the whole velocity in a
certain time in ascending, will, in the same time, generate again the
same velocity by the same gradations inverted; and therefore the same
space will be passed over in the same time in the descent and in the
ascent.</p>
<p>Another difficulty arose from a necessary consequence of the Laws
of Falling Bodies thus established;&#8212;the proposition, namely,
that in acquiring its motion, a body passes through every intermediate
degree of velocity, from the smallest conceivable, up to that which it
at last acquires. When a body falls from rest, it begins to fall with
<em>no</em> velocity; the velocity increases with the time; and in
one-thousandth part of a second, the body has only acquired
one-thousandth part of the velocity which it has at the end of one
second.</p>
<p>This is certain, and manifest on consideration; yet there was at
first much difficulty raised on the subject of this assertion; and
disputes took place concerning the velocity with which a body
<em>begins</em> to fall. On this subject also Descartes did not form
clear notions. He writes to a correspondent, “I have been revising my
notes on Galileo, in which I have not said expressly that falling
bodies do not pass through every degree of slowness, but I said that
this cannot be known without knowing what Weight is, which comes to
the same thing; as to your example, I grant that it proves that every
degree of velocity is infinitely divisible, but not that a falling
body actually passes through all these divisions.”</p>
<p>The Principles of the Motion of Falling Bodies being thus
established by Galileo, the Deduction of the principal mathematical
consequences was, as is usual, effected with great rapidity, and is to
be found <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page329">329</a></span> in his
works, and in those of his scholars and successors. The motion of
bodies falling freely was, however, in such treatises, generally
combined with the motion of bodies Falling along Inclined Planes; a
part of the theory of which we have still to speak.</p>
<p>The Notion of Accelerating Force and of its operation, once formed,
was naturally applied in other cases than that of bodies falling
freely. The different velocities with which heavy and light bodies
fall were explained by the different resistance of the air, which
diminishes the accelerating force;<a id="fnanchor15-6"
href="#note15-6"><span class="fnanchor">15</span></a> and it was
boldly asserted, that in a vacuum a lock of wool and a piece of lead
would fall equally quickly. It was also maintained<a id="fnanchor16-6"
href="#note16-6"><span class="fnanchor">16</span></a> that any falling
body, however large and heavy, would always have its velocity in some
degree diminished by the air in which it falls, and would at last be
reduced to a state of uniform motion, as soon as the resistance
upwards became equal to the accelerating force downwards. Though the
law of progress of a body to this limiting velocity was not made out
till the <i>Principia</i> of Newton appeared, the views on which
Galileo made this assertion are perfectly sound, and show that he had
clearly conceived the nature and operation of accelerating and
retarding force.</p>

<p>When Uniform Accelerating Forces had once been mastered, there
remained only mathematical difficulties in the treatment of Variable
Forces. A Variable Force was measured by the <i>Limit</i> of the
increment of the Velocity, compared with the increment of the Time;
just as a Variable Velocity was measured by the Limit of the increment
of the Space compared with that of the Time.</p>
<p>With this introduction of the Notion of Limits, we are, of course,
led to the Higher Geometry, either in its geometrical or its
analytical form. The general laws of bodies falling by the action of
any Variable Forces were given by Newton in the Seventh Section of the
<i>Principia</i>. The subject is there, according to Newton’s
preference of geometrical methods, treated by means of the Quadrature
of Curves; the Doctrine of Limits being exhibited in a peculiar manner
in the First Section of the work, in order to prepare the way for such
applications of it. Leibnitz, the Bernouillis, Euler, and since their
time, many other mathematicians, have treated such questions by means
of the analytical method of limits, the Differential Calculus. The
Rectilinear Motion of bodies acted upon by variable forces is, of
course, a simpler problem than their Curvilinear Motion, to which we
have now to proceed. But it <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page330">330</a></span> may be remarked that Newton, having
established the laws of Curvilinear Motion independently, has, in a
great part of his Seventh Section, deduced the simpler case of the
Rectilinear Motion from the move complex problem, by reasonings of
great ingenuity and beauty.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Establishment of the Second Law of
Motion.&#8212;Curvilinear Motions.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">A slight</span> degree of distinctness in men’s
mechanical notions enabled them to perceive, as we have already
explained, that a body which traces a curved line must be urged by
some force, by which it is constantly made to deviate from that
rectilinear path, which it would pursue if acted upon by no force.
Thus, when a body is made to describe a circle, as when a stone is
whirled round in a sling, we find that the string does exert such a
force on the stone; for the string is stretched by the effort, and if
it be too slender, it may thus be broken. This <i>centrifugal
force</i> of bodies moving in circles was noticed even by the
ancients. The effect of force to produce curvilinear motion also
appears in the paths described by projectiles. We have already seen
that though Tartalea did not perceive this correctly, Rivius, about
the same time, did.</p>
<p>To see that a transverse force would produce a curve, was one step;
to determine what the curve is, was another step, which involved the
discovery of the Second Law of Motion. This step was made by Galileo.
In his <i>Dialogues on Motion</i>, he asserts that a body projected
horizontally will retain a uniform motion in the horizontal direction,
and will have, compounded with this, a uniformly accelerated motion
downwards, that is, the motion of a body falling vertically from rest;
and will thus describe the curve called a parabola.</p>
<p>The Second Law of Motion consists of this assertion in a general
form;&#8212;namely, that in all cases the motion which the force will
produce is compounded with the motion which the body previously has.
This was not obvious; for Cardan had maintained,<a id="fnanchor17-6"
href="#note17-6"><span class="fnanchor">17</span></a> that “if a body
is moved by two motions at once, it will come to the place resulting
from their composition slower than by either of them.” The proof of
the truth of the law to Galileo’s mind was, so far as we collect from
the Dialogue itself, the simplicity of the supposition, and his clear
perception of the causes which, in some cases, produced an obvious
deviation in practice <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page331">331</a></span> from this theoretical result. For it may
be observed, that the curvilinear paths ascribed to military
projectiles by Rivius and Tartalea, and by other writers who followed
them, as Digges and Norton in our own country, though utterly
different from the theoretical form, the parabola, do, in fact,
approach nearer the true paths of a cannon or musket ball than a
parabola would do; and this approximation more especially exists in
that which at first sight appears most absurd in the old theory;
namely, the assertion that the ball, which ascends in a sloping
direction, finally descends vertically. In consequence of the
resistance of the air, this is really the path of a projectile; and
when the velocity is very great, as in military projectiles, the
deviation from the parabolic form is very manifest. This cause of
discrepancy between the theory, which does not take resistance into
the account, and the fact, Galileo perceived; and accordingly he
says,<a id="fnanchor18-6" href="#note18-6"><span
class="fnanchor">18</span></a> that the velocities of the projectiles,
in such cases, may be considered as excessive and supernatural. With
the due allowance to such causes, he maintained that his theory was
verified, and might be applied in practice. Such practical
applications of the doctrine of projectiles no doubt had a share in
establishing the truth of Galileo’s views. We must not forget,
however, that the full establishment of this second law of motion was
the result of the theoretical and experimental discussions concerning
the motion of the earth: its fortunes were involved in those of the
Copernican system; and it shared the triumph of that doctrine. This
triumph was already decisive, indeed, in the time of Galileo, but not
complete till the time of Newton.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 4.&#8212;<i>Generalization of the Laws of
Equilibrium.&#8212;Principle of Virtual Velocities.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">It</span> was known, even as early as Aristotle,
that the two weights which balance each other on the lever, if they
move at all, move with velocities which are in the inverse proportions
of the weights. The peculiar resources of the Greek language, which
could state this relation of inverse proportionality in a single word
(ἀντιπέπονθεν), fixed it in men’s minds, and prompted them to
generalize from this property. Such attempts were at first made with
indistinct ideas, and on conjecture only, and had, therefore, no
scientific value. This is the judgment which we must pass on the book
of Jordanus Nemorarius, which <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page332">332</a></span> we have <a href="#v1page314">already</a>
mentioned. Its reasonings are professedly on Aristotelian principles,
and exhibit the common Aristotelian absence of all distinct mechanical
ideas. But in Varro, whose <i>Tractatus de Motu</i> appeared in 1584,
we find the principle, in a general form, not satisfactorily proved,
indeed, but much more distinctly conceived. This is his first theorem:
“Duarum virium connexarum quarum (si moveantur) motus erunt ipsis
ἀντιπεπονθῶς proportionales, neutra alteram movebit, sed equilibrium
facient.” The proof offered of this is, that the resistance to a force
is as the motion produced; and, as we have seen, the theorem is
rightly applied in the example of the wedge. From this time it appears
to have been usual to prove the properties of machines by means of
this principle. This is done, for instance, in <i>Les Raisons des
Forces Mouvantes</i>, the production of Solomon de Caus, engineer to
the Elector Palatine, published at Antwerp in 1616; in which the
effect of Toothed-Wheels and of the Screw is determined in this
manner, but the Inclined Plane is not treated of. The same is the case
in Bishop Wilkins’s <i>Mathematical Magic</i>, in 1648.</p>
<p>When the true doctrine of the Inclined Plane had been established,
the laws of equilibrium for all the simple machines or Mechanical
Powers, as they had usually been enumerated in books on Mechanics,
were brought into view; for it was easy to see that the <i>Wedge</i>
and the <i>Screw</i> involved the same principle as the <i>Inclined
Plane</i>, and the <i>Pulley</i> could obviously be reduced to the
<i>Lever</i>. It was, also, not difficult for a person with clear
mechanical ideas to perceive how any other combination of bodies, on
which pressure and traction are exerted, may be reduced to these
simple machines, so as to disclose the relation of the forces. Hence
by the discovery of Stevinus, all problems of equilibrium were
essentially solved.</p>
<p>The conjectural generalization of the property of the lever, which
we have just mentioned, enabled mathematicians to express the solution
of all these problems by means of one proposition. This was done by
saying, that in raising a weight by any machine, we <em>lose</em> in
Time what we <em>gain</em> in Force; the weight raised moves as much
<em>slower</em> than the power, as it is <em>larger</em> than the
power. This was explained with great clearness by Galileo, in the
preface to his <i>Treatise on Mechanical Science</i>, published in
1592.</p>
<p>The motions, however, which we here suppose the parts of the
machine to have, are not motions which the forces produce; for at
present we are dealing with the case in which the forces balance each
other, and therefore produce no motion. But we ascribe to the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page333">333</a></span> Weights and Powers
hypothetical motions, arising from some other cause; and then, by the
construction of the machine, the velocities of the Weights and Powers
must have certain definite ratios. These velocities, being thus
hypothetically supposed and not actually produced, are called
<i>Virtual</i> Velocities. And the general law of equilibrium is, that
in any machine, the Weights which balance each other, are reciprocally
to each other as their Virtual Velocities. This is called the
<i>Principle of Virtual Velocities</i>.</p>
<p>This Principle (which was afterwards still further generalized) is,
by some of the admirers of Galileo, dwelt upon as one of his great
services to Mechanics. But if we examine it more nearly, we shall see
that it has not much importance in our history. It is a
generalization, but a generalization established rather by enumeration
of cases, than by any induction proceeding upon one distinct Idea,
like those generalizations of Facts by which Laws are primarily
established. It rather serves verbally to conjoin Laws previously
known, than to exhibit a connection in them: it is rather a help for
the memory than a proof for the reason.</p>
<p>The Principle of Virtual Velocities is so far from implying any
clear possession of mechanical ideas, that any one who knows the
property of the Lever, whether he is capable of seeing the reason for
it or not, can see that the greater weight moves slower in the exact
proportion of its greater magnitude. Accordingly, Aristotle, whose
entire want of sound mechanical views we have shown, has yet noticed
this truth. When Galileo treats of it, instead of offering any reasons
which could independently establish this principle, he gives his
readers a number of analogies and illustrations, many of them very
loose ones. Thus the raising a great weight by a small force, he
illustrates by supposing the weight broken into many small parts, and
conceiving those parts raised one by one. By other persons, the
analogy, already intimated, of gain and loss is referred to as an
argument for the principle in question. Such images may please the
fancy, but they cannot be accepted as mechanical reasons.</p>
<p>Since Galileo neither first enunciated this rule, nor ever proved
it as an independent principle of Mechanics, we cannot consider the
discovery of it as one of his mechanical achievements. Still less can
we compare his reference to this principle with Stevinus’s proof of
the Inclined Plane; which, as we have seen, was rigorously inferred
from the sound axiom, that a body cannot put itself in motion. If we
were to assent to the really self-evident axioms of Stevinus, only in
virtue <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page334">334</a></span> of the
unproved verbal generalization of Galileo, we should be in great
danger of allowing ourselves to be referred successively from one
truth to another, without any reasonable hope of ever arriving at any
thing ultimate and fundamental.</p>
<p>But though this Principle of Virtual Velocity cannot be looked upon
as a great discovery of Galileo, it is a highly useful rule; and the
various forms under which he and his successors urged it, tended much
to dissipate the vague wonder with which the effects of machines had
been looked upon; and thus to diffuse sounder and clearer notions on
such subjects.</p>
<p>The Principle of Virtual Velocities also affected the progress of
mechanical science in another way: it suggested some of the analogies
by the aid of which the Third Law of Motion was made out; leading to
the adoption of the notion of <i>Momentum</i> as the arithmetical
product of weight and velocity. Since on a machine on which a weight
of two pounds at one part balances three pounds at another part, the
former weight would move through three inches while the latter would
move through two inches; we see (since three multiplied into two is
equal to two multiplied into three) that the <em>Product</em> of the
weight and the velocity is the same for the two balancing weights; and
if we call this Product <i>Momentum</i>, the Law of Equilibrium is,
that when two weights balance on a machine, the Momentum of the two
would be the same, if they were put in motion.</p>
<p>The Notion of Momentum was here employed in connection with Virtual
Velocities; but it also came under consideration in treating of Actual
Velocities, as we shall soon see.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 5.&#8212;<i>Attempts at the Third Law of
Motion.&#8212;Notion of Momentum.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">In</span> the questions we have hitherto had to
consider respecting Motion, no regard is had to the Size of the body
moved, but only to the Velocity and Direction of the motion. We must
now trace the progress of knowledge respecting the mode in which the
Mass of the body influences the effect of Force. This is a more
difficult and complex branch of the subject; but it is one which
requires to be noticed, as obviously as the former. Questions
belonging to this department of Mechanics, as well as to the others,
occur in Aristotle’s Mechanical Problems. “Why,” says he, “is it, that
neither very small nor very large bodies go far when we throw them;
but, in order that this may <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page335">335</a></span> happen, the thing thrown must have a
certain proportion to the agent which throws it? Is it that what is
thrown or pushed must react<a id="fnanchor19-6" href="#note19-6"><span
class="fnanchor">19</span></a> against that which pushes it; and that
a body so large as not to yield at all, or so small as to yield
entirely, and not to react, produces no throw or push?” The same
confusion of ideas prevailed after his time; and mechanical questions
were in vain discussed by means of general and abstract terms,
employed with no distinct and steady meaning; such as <i>impetus</i>,
<i>power</i>, <i>momentum</i>, <i>virtue</i>, <i>energy</i>, and the
like. From some of these speculations we may judge how thorough the
confusion in men’s heads had become. Cardan perplexes himself with the
difficulty, already mentioned, of the comparison of the forces of
bodies at rest and in motion. If the Force of a body depends on its
velocity, as it appears to do, how is it that a body at rest has any
Force at all, and how can it resist the slightest effort, or exert any
pressure? He flatters himself that he solves the question, by
asserting that bodies at rest have an occult motion. “Corpus movetur
occulto motu quiescendo.”&#8212;Another puzzle, with which he appears
to distress himself rather more wantonly, is this: “If one man can
draw half of a certain weight, and another man also one half; when the
two act together, these proportions should be compounded; so that they
ought to be able to draw one half of one half, or one quarter only.”
The talent which ingenious men had for getting into such perplexities,
was certainly at one time very great. Arriaga,<a id="fnanchor20-6"
href="#note20-6"><span class="fnanchor">20</span></a> who wrote in
1639, is troubled to discover how several flat weights, lying one upon
another on a board, should produce a greater pressure than the lowest
one alone produces, since that alone touches the board. Among other
solutions, he suggests that the board affects the upper weight, which
it does not touch, by determining its <i>ubication</i>, or
<i>whereness</i>.</p>

href="#fnanchor20-6">20</a></span> Rod. de Arriaga, <i>Cursus
Philosophicus</i>. Paris, 1639.</div>
<p>Aristotle’s doctrine, that a body ten times as heavy as another,
will fall ten times as fast, is another instance of the confusion of
Statical and Dynamical Forces: the Force of the greater body, while
<em>at rest</em>, is ten times as great as that of the other; but the
Force as measured by the <em>velocity</em> produced, is equal in the
two cases. The two bodies would fall downwards with the same rapidity,
except so far as they are affected by accidental causes. The merit of
proving this by experiment, and thus refuting the Aristotelian dogma,
is usually ascribed to Galileo, who made his experiment from the
famous leaning tower of Pisa, about 1590. But others about the same
time had not <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page336">336</a></span>
overlooked so obvious a fact&#8212;F. Piccolomini, in his <i>Liber
Scientiæ de Natura</i>, published at Padua, in 1597, says, “On the
subject of the motion of heavy and light bodies, Aristotle has put
forth various opinions, which are contrary to sense and experience,
and has delivered rules concerning the proportion of quickness and
slowness, which are palpably false. For a stone twice as great does
<em>not</em> move twice as fast.” And Stevinus, in the Appendix to his
Statics, describes his having made the experiment, and speaks with
great correctness of the apparent deviations from the rule, arising
from the resistance of the air. Indeed, the result followed by very
obvious reasoning; for ten bricks, in contact with each other, side by
side, would obviously fall in the same time as one; and these might be
conceived to form a body ten times as large as one of them.
Accordingly, Benedetti, in 1585, reasons in this manner with regard to
bodies of different size, though he retains Aristotle’s error as to
the different velocity of bodies of different density.</p>
<p>The next step in this subject is more clearly due to Galileo; he
discovered the true proportion which the Accelerating Force of a body
falling down an inclined plane bears to the Accelerating Force of the
same body falling freely. This was at first a happy conjecture; it was
then confirmed by experiments, and, finally, after some hesitation, it
was referred to its true principle, the Third Law of Motion, with
proper elementary simplicity. The Principle here spoken of is
this:&#8212;that for the same body, the Dynamical effect of force is
as the Statical effect; that is, the Velocity which any force
generates in a given time when it puts the body in motion, is
proportional to the Pressure which the same force produces in a body
at rest. The Principle, so stated, appears very simple and obvious;
yet this was not the form in which it suggested itself either to
Galileo or to other persons who sought to prove it. Galileo, in his
<i>Dialogues on Motion</i>, assumes, as his fundamental proposition on
this subject, one much less evident than that we have quoted, but one
in which that is involved. His Postulate is,<a id="fnanchor21-6"
href="#note21-6"><span class="fnanchor">21</span></a> that when the
same body falls down different planes of the same height, the
velocities acquired are equal. He confirms and illustrates this by a
very ingenious experiment on a pendulum, showing that the weight
swings to the same height whatever path it be compelled to follow.
Torricelli, in his treatise published 1644, says that he had heard
that Galileo had, towards the end of his life, proved his <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page337">337</a></span> assumption, but that,
not having seen the proof, he will give his own. In this he refers us
to the right principle, but appears not distinctly to conceive the
proof, since he estimates <em>momentum</em> indiscriminately by the
statical Pressure of a body, and by its Velocity when in motion; as if
these two quantities were self-evidently equal. Huyghens, in 1673,
expresses himself dissatisfied with the proof by which Galileo’s
assumption was supported in the later editions of his works. His own
proof rests on this principle;&#8212;that if a body fall down one
inclined plane, and proceed up another with the velocity thus
acquired, it cannot, under any circumstances, ascend to a higher
position than that from which it fell. This principle coincides very
nearly with Galileo’s experimental illustration. In truth, however,
Galileo’s principle, which Huyghens thus slights, may be looked upon
as a satisfactory statement of the true law  namely, that, in the same
body, the velocity produced is as the pressure which produces it. “We
are agreed,” he says,<a id="fnanchor22-6" href="#note22-6"><span
class="fnanchor">22</span></a> “that, in a movable body, the
<i>impetus</i>, <i>energy</i>, <i>momentum</i>, or <i>propension to
motion</i>, is as great as is the <i>force</i> or <i>least
resistance</i> which suffices to <i>support</i> it.” The various terms
here used, both for dynamical and statical Force, show that Galileo’s
ideas were not confused by the ambiguity of any one term, as appears
to have happened to some mathematicians. The principle thus announced,
is, as we shall see, one of great extent and value; and we read with
interest the circumstances of its discovery, which are thus
narrated.<a id="fnanchor23-6" href="#note23-6"><span
class="fnanchor">23</span></a> When Viviani was studying with Galileo,
he expressed his dissatisfaction at the want of any clear reason for
Galileo’s postulate respecting the equality of velocities acquired
down inclined planes of the same heights; the consequence of which
was, that Galileo, as he lay, the same night, sleepless through
indisposition, discovered the proof which he had long sought in vain,
and introduced it in the subsequent editions. It is easy to see, by
looking at the proof, that the discoverer had had to struggle, not for
intermediate steps of reasoning between remote notions, as in a
problem of geometry, but for a clear possession of ideas which were
near each other, and which he had not yet been able to bring into
contact, because he had not yet a sufficiently firm grasp of them.
Such terms as Momentum and Force had been sources of confusion from
the time of Aristotle; and it required considerable steadiness of
thought to compare the forces of bodies at rest and in motion under
the obscurity and vacillation thus produced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page338">338</a></span> The term
<i>Momentum</i> had been introduced to express the force of bodies in
motion, before it was known what that effect was. Galileo, in his
<i>Discorso intorno alle Cose che stanno in su l’ Acqua</i>, says,
that “Momentum is the force, efficacy, or virtue, with which the
motion moves and the body moved resists, depending not upon weight
only, but upon the velocity, inclination, and any other cause of such
virtue.” When he arrived at more precision in his views, he
determined, as we have seen, that, in the same body, the Momentum is
<em>proportional</em> to the Velocity; and, hence it was easily seen
that in different bodies it was proportional to the Velocity and Mass
jointly. The principle thus enunciated is capable of very extensive
application, and, among other consequences, leads to a determination
of the results of the mutual Percussion of Bodies. But though Galileo,
like others of his predecessors and contemporaries, had speculated
concerning the problem of Percussion, he did not arrive at any
satisfactory conclusion; and the problem remained for the
mathematicians of the next generation to solve.</p>
<p>We may here notice Descartes and his Laws of Motion, the
publication of which is sometimes spoken of as an important event in
the history of Mechanics. This is saying far too much. The
<i>Principia</i> of Descartes did little for physical science. His
assertion of the Laws of Motion, in their most general shape, was
perhaps an improvement in form; but his Third Law is false in
substance. Descartes claimed several of the discoveries of Galileo and
others of his contemporaries; but we cannot assent to such claims,
when we find that, as we shall see, he did not understand, or would
not apply, the Laws of Motion when he had them before him. If we were
to compare Descartes with Galileo, we might say, that of the
mechanical truths which were easily attainable in the beginning of the
seventeenth century, Galileo took hold of as many, and Descartes of as
few, as was well possible for a man of genius.</p>

Vinci, Fracastoro, Maurolycus, Commandinus, Benedetti, he adds
(<i>Hist. des Sciences Mathématiques en Italie</i>, t. iii. p. 131):
“This short analysis is sufficient to show that, at the period at
which we are arrived, Aristotle no longer reigned unquestioned in the
Italian Schools. If we had to write the history of philosophy, we
should prove by a multitude of facts that it was the Italians who
overthrew the ancient idol of philosophers. Men go on incessantly
repeating that the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page339">339</a></span> struggle was begun by Descartes, and
they proclaim him the legislator of modern philosophers. But when we
examine the philosophical writings of Fracastoro, of Benedetti, of
Cardan, and above all, those of Galileo; when we see on all sides
energetic protests raised against the peripatetic doctrines; we ask,
what there remained for the inventor of vortices to do, in overturning
the natural philosophy of Aristotle? In addition to this, the
memorable labors of the School of Cosenza, of Telesius, of Giordano
Bruno, of Campanella; the writings of Patricius, who was, besides, a
good geometer; of Nizolius, whom Leibnitz esteemed so highly, and of
the other metaphysicians of the same epoch,&#8212;prove that the
ancient philosophy had already lost its empire on that side the Alps,
when Descartes threw himself upon the enemy now put to the rout. The
yoke was cast off in Italy, and all Europe had only to follow the
example, without its being necessary to give a new impulse to real
science.”</p>
<p>In England, we are accustomed to hear Francis Bacon, rather than
Descartes, spoken of as the first great antagonist of the Aristotelian
schools, and the legislator of modern philosophy. But it is true, both
of one and the other, that the overthrow of the ancient system had
been effectively begun before their time by the practical discoverers
here mentioned, and others who, by experiment and reasoning,
established truths inconsistent with the received Aristotelian
doctrines. Gilbert in England, Kepler in Germany, as well as Benedetti
and Galileo in Italy, gave a powerful impulse to the cause of real
knowledge, before the influence of Bacon and Descartes had produced
any general effect. What Bacon really did was this;&#8212;that by the
august image which he presented of a future Philosophy, the rival of
the Aristotelian, and far more powerful and extensive, he drew to it
the affections and hopes of all men of comprehensive and vigorous
minds, as well as of those who attended to special trains of
discovery. He announced a New Method, not merely a correction of
special current errors; he thus converted the Insurrection into a
Revolution, and established a new philosophical Dynasty. Descartes
had, in some degree, the same purpose; and, in addition to this, he
not only proclaimed himself the author of a New Method, but professed
to give a complete system of the results of the Method. His physical
philosophy was put forth as complete and demonstrative, and thus
involved the vices of the ancient dogmatism. Telesius and Campanella
had also grand notions of an entire reform in the method of
philosophizing, as I have noticed in the <i>Philosophy of the
Inductive Sciences</i>, Book xii.] <span class="pagenum"><a

<span class="sc">Sequel to the Epoch of Galileo.&#8212;Period of
Verification and Deduction.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> evidence on which Galileo
rested the truth of the Laws of Motion which he asserted, was, as we
have seen, the simplicity of the laws themselves, and the agreement of
their consequences with facts; proper allowances being made for
disturbing causes. His successors took up and continued the task of
making repeated comparisons of the theory with practice, till no doubt
remained of the exactness of the fundamental doctrines: they also
employed themselves in simplifying, as much as possible, the mode of
stating these doctrines, and in tracing their consequences in various
problems by the aid of mathematical reasoning. These employments led
to the publication of various Treatises on Falling Bodies, Inclined
Planes, Pendulums, Projectiles, Spouting Fluids, which occupied a
great part of the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>The authors of these treatises may be considered as the School of
Galileo. Several of them were, indeed, his pupils or personal friends.
Castelli was his disciple and astronomical assistant at Florence, and
afterwards his correspondent. Torricelli was at first a pupil of
Castelli, but became the inmate and amanuensis of Galileo in 1641, and
succeeded him in his situation at the court of Florence on his death,
which took place a few months afterwards. Viviani formed one of his
family during the three last years of his life; and surviving him and
his contemporaries (for Viviani lived even into the eighteenth
century), has a manifest pleasure and pride in calling himself the
last of the disciples of Galileo. Gassendi, an eminent French
mathematician and professor, visited him in 1628; and it shows us the
extent of his reputation when we find Milton referring thus to his
travels in Italy:<a id="fnanchor24-6" href="#note24-6"><span
class="fnanchor">24</span></a> “There it was that I found and visited
the famous Galileo, grown old, a prisoner in the Inquisition, for
thinking in astronomy otherwise than the Franciscan and Dominican
licensers thought.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note24-6"
href="#fnanchor24-6">24</a></span> <i>Speech for the Liberty of
Unlicensed Printing.</i></div>
<p>Besides the above writers, we may mention, as persons who pursued
and illustrated Galileo’s doctrines, Borelli, who was professor at
Florence and Pisa; Mersenne, the correspondent of Descartes, who was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page341">341</a></span> professor at
Paris; Wallis, who was appointed Savilian professor at Oxford in 1649,
his predecessor being ejected by the parliamentary commissioners. It
is not necessary for us to trace the progress of purely mathematical
inventions, which constitute a great part of the works of these
authors; but a few circumstances may be mentioned.</p>
<p>The question of the proof of the Second Law of Motion was, from the
first, identified with the controversy respecting the truth of the
Copernican System; for this law supplied the true answer to the most
formidable of the objections against the motion of the earth; namely,
that if the earth were moving, bodies which were dropt from an
elevated object would be left behind by the place from which they
fell. This argument was reproduced in various forms by the opponents
of the new doctrine; and the answers to the argument, though they
belong to the history of Astronomy, and form part of the Sequel to the
Epoch of Copernicus, belong more peculiarly to the history of
Mechanics, and are events in the sequel to the Discoveries of Galileo.
So far, indeed, as the mechanical controversy was concerned, the
advocates of the Second Law of Motion appealed, very triumphantly, to
experiment. Gassendi made many experiments on this subject publicly,
of which an account is given in his <i>Epistolæ tres de Motu Impresso
a Motore Translato</i><a id="fnanchor25-6" href="#note25-6"><span
class="fnanchor">25</span></a> It appeared in these experiments, that
bodies let fall downwards, or cast upwards, forwards, or backwards,
from a ship, or chariot, or man, whether at rest, or in any degree of
motion, had always the same motion relatively to the <em>motor</em>.
In the application of this principle to the system of the world,
indeed, Gassendi and other philosophers of his time were greatly
hampered; for the deference which religious scruples required, did not
allow them to say that the earth really moved, but only that the
physical reasons against its motion were invalid. This restriction
enabled Riccioli and other writers on the geocentric side to involve
the subject in metaphysical difficulties; but the conviction of men
was not permanently shaken by these, and the Second Law of Motion was
soon assumed as unquestioned.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note25-6"
href="#fnanchor25-6">25</a></span> Mont. ii. 199.</div>
<p>The Laws of the Motion of Falling Bodies, as assigned by Galileo,
were confirmed by the reasonings of Gassendi and Fermat, and the
experiments of Riccioli and Grimaldi; and the effect of resistance was
pointed out by <span class="correction" title="here spelled
Marsenne">Mersenne</span> and Dechales. The parabolic motion of
Projectiles was more especially illustrated by experiments on the jet
which spouts from an orifice in a vessel full of fluid. This mode of
experimenting <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page342">342</a></span>
is well adapted to attract notice, since the curve described, which is
transient and invisible in the case of a single projectile, becomes
permanent and visible when we have a continuous stream. The doctrine
of the motions of fluids has always been zealously cultivated by the
Italians. Castelli’s treatise, <i>Della Misura dell’ Acque
Corrente</i> (1638), is the first work on this subject, and Montucla
with justice calls him “the creator of a new branch of hydraulics;”<a
id="fnanchor26-6" href="#note26-6"><span
class="fnanchor">26</span></a> although he mistakenly supposed the
velocity of efflux to be as the depth of the orifice from the surface.
<span class="correction" title="here spelled Marsenne">Mersenne</span>
and Torricelli also pursued this subject, and after them, many
others.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note26-6"
href="#fnanchor26-6">26</a></span> Mont. ii. 201.</div>
<p>Galileo’s belief in the near approximation of the curve described
by a cannon-ball or musket-ball to the theoretical parabola, was
somewhat too obsequiously adopted by succeeding practical writers on
artillery. They underrated, as he had done, the effect of the
resistance of the air, which is in effect so great as entirely to
change the form and properties of the curve. Notwithstanding this, the
parabolic theory was employed, as in Anderson’s <i>Art of Gunnery</i>
(1674); and Blondel, in his <i>Art de jeter les Bombes</i> (1688), not
only calculated Tables on this supposition, but attempted to answer
the objections which had been made respecting the form of the curve
described. It was not till a later period (1740), when Robins made a
series of careful and sagacious experiments on artillery, and when
some of the most eminent mathematicians calculated the curve, taking
into account the resistance, that the Theory of Projectiles could be
said to be verified in fact.</p>
<p>The Third Law of Motion was still in some confusion when Galileo
died, as we have seen. The next great step made in the school of
Galileo was the determination of the Laws of the motions of bodies in
their Direct Impact, so far as this impact affects the motion of
translation. The difficulties of the problem of Percussion arose, in
part, from the heterogeneous nature of Pressure (of a body at rest),
and Momentum (of a body in motion); and, in part, from mixing together
the effects of percussion on the parts of a body, as, for instance,
cutting, bruising, and breaking, with its effect in moving the
whole.</p>
<p>The former difficulty had been seen with some clearness by Galileo
himself. In a posthumous addition to his <i>Mechanical Dialogues</i>,
he says, “There are two kinds of resistance in a movable body, one
internal, as when we say it is more difficult to lift a weight of a
thousand pounds than a weight of a hundred; another respecting space,
as <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page343">343</a></span> when we say
that it requires more force to throw a stone one hundred paces than
fifty.”<a id="fnanchor27-6" href="#note27-6"><span
class="fnanchor">27</span></a> Reasoning upon this difference, he
comes to the conclusion that “the Momentum of percussion is infinite,
since there is no resistance, however great, which is not overcome by
a force of percussion, however small.”<a id="fnanchor28-6"
href="#note28-6"><span class="fnanchor">28</span></a> He further
explains this by observing that the resistance to percussion must
occupy some portion of time, although this portion may be insensible.
This correct mode of removing the apparent incongruity of continuous
and instantaneous force, was a material step in the solution of the
problem.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note27-6"
href="#fnanchor27-6">27</a></span> <i>Op.</i> iii. 210.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note28-6"
href="#fnanchor28-6">28</a></span> iii. 211.</div>
<p>The Laws of the mutual Impact of bodies were erroneously given by
Descartes in his <i>Principia</i>; and appear to have been first
correctly stated by Wren, Wallis, and Huyghens, who about the same
time (1669) sent papers to the Royal Society of London on the subject.
In these solutions, we perceive that men were gradually coming to
apprehend the Third Law of Motion in its most general sense; namely,
that the Momentum (which is proportional to the Mass of the body and
its Velocity jointly) may be taken for the measure of the effect; so
that this Momentum is as much diminished in the striking body by the
resistance it experiences, as it is increased in the body struck by
the Impact. This was sometimes expressed by saying that “the Quantity
of Motion remains unaltered,” <i>Quantity of Motion</i> being used as
synonymous with <i>Momentum</i>. Newton expressed it by saying that
“Action and Reaction are equal and opposite,” which is still one of
the most familiar modes of expressing the Third Law of Motion.</p>
<p>In this mode of stating the Law, we see an example of a propensity
which has prevailed very generally among mathematicians; namely, a
disposition to present the fundamental laws of rest and of motion as
if they were equally manifest, and, indeed, identical. The close
analogy and connection which exists between the principles of
equilibrium and of motion, often led men to confound the evidence of
the two; and this confusion introduced an ambiguity in the use of
words, as we have seen in the case of Momentum, Force, and others. The
same may be said of <i>Action</i> and <i>Reaction</i>, which have both
a statical and a dynamical signification. And by this means, the most
general statements of the laws of motion are made to coincide with the
most general statical propositions. For instance, Newton deduced from
his principles the conclusion, that by the mutual action of bodies,
the motion of their centre of gravity cannot be affected. Marriotte,
in his <i>Traité de la</i> <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page344">344</a></span> <i>Percussion</i> (1684), had asserted
this proposition for the case of direct impact. But by the reasoners
of Newton’s time, the dynamical proposition, that the motion of the
centre of gravity is not altered by the actual free motion and impact
of bodies, was associated with the statical proposition, that when
bodies are in equilibrium, the centre of gravity cannot be made to
ascend or descend by the <em>virtual</em> motions of the bodies. This
latter is a proposition which was assumed as self-evident by
Torricelli; but which may more philosophically be proved from
elementary statical principles.</p>
<p>This disposition to identify the elementary laws of equilibrium and
of motion, led men to think too slightingly of the ancient solid and
sufficient foundation of Statics, the doctrine of the lever. When the
progress of thought had opened men’s minds to a more general view of
the subject, it was considered as a blemish in the science to found it
on the properties of one particular machine. Descartes says in his
Letters, that “it is ridiculous to prove the pulley by means of the
lever.” And Varignon was led by similar reflections to the project of
his <i>Nouvelle Mécanique</i>, in which the whole of statics should be
founded on the composition of forces. This project was published in
1687; but the work did not appear till 1725, after the death of the
author. Though the attempt to reduce the equilibrium of all machines
to the composition of forces, is philosophical and meritorious, the
attempt to reduce the composition of Pressures to the composition of
<em>Motions</em>, with which Varignon’s work is occupied, was a
retrograde step in the subject, so far as the progress of distinct
mechanical ideas was concerned.</p>
<p>Thus, at the period at which we have now arrived, the Principles of
Elementary Mechanics were generally known and accepted; and there was
in the minds of mathematicians a prevalent tendency to reduce them to
the most simple and comprehensive form of which they admitted. The
execution of this simplification and extension, which we term the
generalization of the laws, is so important an event, that though it
forms part of the natural sequel of Galileo, we shall treat of it in a
separate <a href="#v1page352">chapter</a>. But we must first bring up
the history of the mechanics of fluids to the corresponding point.

Fluids.</span></h3>
<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Rediscovery of the Laws of
Equilibrium of Fluids.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">WE</span> have <a
href="#v1page98">already</a> said, that the true laws of the
equilibrium of fluids were discovered by Archimedes, and rediscovered
by Galileo and Stevinus; the intermediate time having been occupied by
a vagueness and confusion of thought on physical subjects, which made
it impossible for men to retain such clear views as Archimedes had
disclosed. Stevinus must be considered as the earliest of the authors
of this rediscovery; for his work (<i>Principles of Statik and
Hydrostatik</i>) was published in Dutch about 1585; and in this, his
views are perfectly distinct and correct. He restates the doctrines of
Archimedes, and shows that, as a consequence of them, it follows that
the pressure of a fluid on the bottom of a vessel may be much greater
than the weight of the fluid itself: this he proves, by imagining some
of the upper portions of the vessel to be filled with fixed solid
bodies, which take the place of the fluid, and yet do not alter the
pressure on the base. He also shows what will be the pressure on any
portion of a base in an oblique position; and hence, by certain
mathematical artifices which make an approach to the Infinitesimal
Calculus, he finds the whole pressure on the base in such cases. This
mode of treating the subject would take in a large portion of our
elementary Hydrostatics as the science now stands. Galileo saw the
properties of fluids no less clearly, and explained them very
distinctly, in 1612, in his <i>Discourse on Floating Bodies</i>. It
had been maintained by the Aristotelians, that <em>form</em> was the
cause of bodies floating; and collaterally, that ice was
<em>condensed</em> water; apparently from a confusion of thought
between <em>rigidity</em> and <em>density</em>. Galileo asserted, on
the contrary, that ice is <em>rarefied</em> water, as appears by its
floating: and in support of this, he proved, by various experiments,
that the floating of bodies does not depend on their form. The happy
genius of Galileo is the more remarkable in this case, as the
controversy was a good deal perplexed by the mixture of phenomena of
another kind, due to what is usually called <i>capillary</i> or
<i>molecular attraction</i>. Thus it is a fact, that a <i>ball</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page346">346</a></span> of ebony sinks
in water, while a <i>flat slip</i> of the same material lies on the
surface; and it required considerable sagacity to separate such cases
from the general rule. Galileo’s opinions were attacked by various
writers, as Nozzolini, Vincenzio di Grazia, Ludovico delle Colombe;
and defended by his pupil Castelli, who published a reply in 1615.
These opinions were generally adopted and diffused; but somewhat
later, Pascal pursued the subject more systematically, and wrote his
<i>Treatise of the Equilibrium of Fluids</i> in 1653; in which he
shows that a fluid, inclosed in a vessel, necessarily presses equally
in all directions, by imagining two <i>pistons</i> or sliding plugs,
applied at different parts, the surface of one being centuple that of
the other: it is clear, as he observes, that the force of one man
acting at the first piston, will balance the force of one hundred men
acting at the other. “And thus,” says he, “it appears that a vessel
full of water is a new Principle of Mechanics, and a new Machine which
will multiply force to any degree we choose.” Pascal also referred the
equilibrium of fluids to the “principle of virtual velocities,” which
regulates the equilibrium of other machines. This, indeed, Galileo had
done before him. It followed from this doctrine, that the pressure
which is exercised by the lower parts of a fluid arises from the
weight of the upper parts.</p>
<p>In all this there was nothing which was not easily assented to; but
the extension of these doctrines to the air required an additional
effort of mechanical conception. The pressure of the air on all sides
of us, and its weight above us, were two truths which had never yet
been apprehended with any kind of clearness. Seneca, indeed,<a
id="fnanchor29-6" href="#note29-6"><span
class="fnanchor">29</span></a> talks of the “gravity of the air,” and
of its power of diffusing itself when condensed, as the causes of
wind; but we can hardly consider such propriety of phraseology in him
as more than a chance; for we see the value of his philosophy by what
he immediately adds: “Do you think that we have forces by which we
move ourselves, and that the air is left without any power of moving?
when even water has a motion of its own, as we see in the growth of
plants.” We can hardly attach much value to such a recognition of the
gravity and elasticity of the air.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note29-6"
href="#fnanchor29-6">29</a></span> <i>Quæst. Nat.</i> v. 5.</div>
<p>Yet the effects of these causes were so numerous and obvious, that
the Aristotelians had been obliged to invent a principle to account
for them; namely, “Nature’s Horror of a Vacuum.” To this principle
were referred many familiar phenomena, as suction, breathing, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page347">347</a></span> action of a
pair of bellows, its drawing water if immersed in water, its refusing
to open when the rent is stopped up. The action of a cupping
instrument, in which the air is rarefied by fire; the fact that water
is supported when a full inverted bottle is placed in a basin; or when
a full tube, open below and closed above, is similarly placed; the
running out of the water, in this instance, when the top is opened;
the action of a siphon, of a syringe, of a pump; the adhesion of two
polished plates, and other facts, were all explained by the <i>fuga
vacui</i>. Indeed, we must contend that the principle was a very good
one, inasmuch as it brought together all these facts which are really
of the same kind, and referred them to a common cause. But when urged
as an ultimate principle, it was not only <em>unphilosophical</em>,
but <em>imperfect</em> and <em>wrong</em>. It was
<em>unphilosophical</em>, because it introduced the notion of an
emotion, Horror, as an account of physical facts; it was
<em>imperfect</em>, because it was at best only a law of phenomena,
not pointing out any physical cause; and it was <em>wrong</em>,
because it gave an unlimited extent to the effect. Accordingly, it led
to mistakes. Thus Mersenne, in 1644, speaks of a siphon which shall go
over a mountain, being ignorant then that the effect of such an
instrument was limited to a height of thirty-four feet. A few years
later, however, he had detected this mistake; and in his third volume,
published in 1647, he puts his siphon in his <i>emendanda</i>, and
speaks correctly of the weight of air as supporting the mercury in the
tube of Torricelli. It was, indeed, by finding this horror of a vacuum
to have a limit at the height of thirty-four feet, that the true
principle was suggested. It was discovered that when attempts were
made to raise water higher than this. Nature tolerated a vacuum above
the water which rose. In 1643, Torricelli tried to produce this vacuum
at a smaller height, by using, instead of water, the heavier fluid,
quicksilver; an attempt which shows that the true explanation, the
balance of the weight of the water by another pressure, had already
suggested itself. Indeed, this appears from other evidence. Galileo
had already taught that the air has weight; and Baliani, writing to
him in 1630, says,<a id="fnanchor30-6" href="#note30-6"><span
class="fnanchor">30</span></a> “If we were in a vacuum, the weight of
the air above our heads would be felt.” Descartes also appears to have
some share in this discovery; for, in a letter of the date of 1631, he
explains the suspension of mercury in a tube, closed at top, by the
pressure of the column of air reaching to the clouds.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note30-6"
href="#fnanchor30-6">30</a></span> Drinkwater’s <i>Galileo</i>, p.
90.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page348">348</a></span> Still men’s
minds wanted confirmation in this view; and they found such
confirmation, when, in 1647, Pascal showed practically, that if we
alter the length of the superincumbent column of air by going to a
high place, we alter the weight which it will support. This celebrated
experiment was made by Pascal himself on a church-steeple in Paris,
the column of mercury in the Torricellian tube being used to compare
the weights of the air; but he wrote to his brother-in-law, who lived
near the high mountain of Puy de Dôme in Auvergne, to request him to
make the experiment there, where the result would be more decisive.
“You see,” he says, “that if it happens that the height of the mercury
at the top of the hill be less than at the bottom (which I have many
reasons to believe, though all those who have thought about it are of
a different opinion), it will follow that the weight and pressure of
the air are the sole cause of this suspension, and not the horror of a
vacuum: since it is very certain that there is more air to weigh on it
at the bottom than at the top; while we cannot say that nature abhors
a vacuum at the foot of a mountain more than on its summit.”&#8212;M.
Perrier, Pascal’s correspondent, made the observation as he had
desired, and found a difference of three inches of mercury, “which,”
he says, “ravished us with admiration and astonishment.”</p>
<p>When the least obvious case of the operation of the pressure and
weight of fluids had thus been made out, there were no further
difficulties in the progress of the theory of Hydrostatics. When
mathematicians began to consider more general cases than those of the
action of gravity, there arose differences in the way of stating the
appropriate principles: but none of these differences imply any
different conception of the fundamental nature of fluid
equilibrium.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Discovery of the Laws of Motion of
Fluids.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> art of conducting water in pipes, and
of directing its motion for various purposes, is very old. When
treated systematically, it has been termed <i>Hydraulics</i>: but
<i>Hydrodynamics</i> is the general name of the science of the laws of
the motions of fluids, under those or other circumstances. The Art is
as old as the commencement of civilization: the Science does not
ascend higher than the time of Newton, though attempts on such
subjects were made by Galileo and his scholars.</p>
<p>When a fluid spouts from an orifice in a vessel, Castelli saw that
the velocity of efflux depends on the depth of the orifice below the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page349">349</a></span> surface: but he
erroneously judged the velocity to be exactly proportional to the
depth. Torricelli found that the fluid, under the inevitable causes of
defect which occur in the experiment, would spout nearly to the height
of the surface: he therefore inferred, that the full velocity is that
which a body would acquire in falling through the depth; and that it
is consequently proportional to the square root of the
depth.&#8212;This, however, he stated only as a result of experience,
or law of phenomena, at the end of his treatise, <i>De Motu
Naturaliter Accelerato</i>, printed in 1643.</p>
<p>Newton treated the subject theoretically in the <i>Principia</i>
(1687); but we must allow, as Lagrange says, that this is the least
satisfactory passage of that great work. Newton, having made his
experiments in another manner than Torricelli, namely, by measuring
the quantity of the efflux instead of its velocity, found a result
inconsistent with that of Torricelli. The velocity inferred from the
quantity discharged, was only that due to <em>half</em> the depth of
the fluid.</p>
<p>In the first edition of the <i>Principia</i>,<a id="fnanchor31-6"
href="#note31-6"><span class="fnanchor">31</span></a> Newton gave a
train of reasoning by which he theoretically demonstrated his own
result, going upon the principle, that the momentum of the issuing
fluid is equal to the momentum which the column vertically over the
orifice would generate by its gravity. But Torricelli’s experiments,
which had given the velocity due to the whole depth, were confirmed on
repetition: how was this discrepancy to be explained?</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note31-6"
href="#fnanchor31-6">31</a></span> B. ii. Prop. xxxvii.</div>
<p>Newton explained the discrepancy by observing the contraction which
the jet, or vein of water, undergoes, just after it leaves the
orifice, and which he called the <i>vena contracta</i>. At the
orifice, the velocity is that due to half the height; at the <i>vena
contracta</i> it is that due to the whole height. The former velocity
regulates the quantity of the discharge; the latter, the path of the
jet.</p>
<p>This explanation was an important step in the subject; but it made
Newton’s original proof appear very defective, to say the least. In
the second edition of the <i>Principia</i> (1714), Newton attacked the
problem in a manner altogether different from his former
investigation. He there assumed, that when a round vessel, containing
fluid, has a hole in its bottom, the descending fluid may be conceived
to be a conoidal mass, which has its base at the surface of the fluid,
and its narrow end at the orifice. This portion of the fluid he calls
the <i>cataract</i>; and supposes that while this part descends, the
surrounding <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page350">350</a></span>
parts remain immovable, as if they were frozen; in this way he finds a
result agreeing with Torricelli’s experiments on the velocity of the
efflux.</p>
<p>We must allow that the assumptions by which this result is obtained
are somewhat arbitrary; and those which Newton introduces in
attempting to connect the problem of issuing fluids with that of the
resistance to a body moving in a fluid, are no less so. But even up to
the present time, mathematicians have not been able to reduce problems
concerning the motions of fluids to mathematical principles and
calculations, without introducing some steps of this arbitrary kind.
And one of the uses of experiments on this subject is, to suggest
those hypotheses which may enable us, in the manner most consonant
with the true state of things, to reduce the motions of fluids to
those general laws of mechanics, to which we know they must be
subject.</p>
<p>Hence the science of the Motion of Fluids, unlike all the other
primary departments of Mechanics, is a subject on which we still need
experiments, to point out the fundamental principles. Many such
experiments have been made, with a view either to compare the results
of deduction and observation, or, when this comparison failed, to
obtain purely empirical rules. In this way the resistance of fluids,
and the motion of water in pipes, canals, and rivers, has been
treated. Italy has possessed, from early times, a large body of such
writers. The earlier works of this kind have been collected in sixteen
quarto volumes. Lecchi and Michelotti about 1765, Bidone more
recently, have pursued these inquiries. Bossut, Buat, Hachette, in
France, have labored at the same task, as have Coulomb and Prony,
Girard and Poncelet. Eytelwein’s German treatise (<i>Hydraulik</i>)
contains an account of what others and himself have done. Many of
these trains of experiments, both in France and Italy, were made at
the expense of governments, and on a very magnificent scale. In
England less was done in this way during the last century, than in
most other countries. The <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>, for
instance, scarcely contain a single paper on this subject founded on
experimental investigations.<a id="fnanchor32-6"
href="#note32-6"><span class="fnanchor">32</span></a> Dr. Thomas
Young, who was at the head of his countrymen in so many branches of
science, was one of the first to call back attention to this: and Mr.
Rennie and others have recently made valuable experiments. In many of
the questions now spoken of, the accordance which engineers are able
to obtain, between their calculated and observed results, <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page351">351</a></span> is very great: but
these calculations are performed by means of empirical formulæ, which
do not connect the facts with their causes, and still leave a wide
space to be traversed, in order to complete the science.</p>

<p>In the mean time, all the other portions of Mechanics were reduced
to general laws, and analytical processes; and means were found of
including Hydrodynamics, notwithstanding the difficulties which attend
its special problems, in this common improvement of form. This
progress we must relate.</p>
<p>[2d Ed.] [The hydrodynamical problems referred to above are, the
laws of a fluid issuing from a vessel, the laws of the motion of water
in pipes, canals, and rivers, and the laws of the resistance of
fluids. To these may be added, as an hydrodynamical problem important
in theory, in experiment, and in the comparison of the two, the laws
of waves. Newton gave, in the <i>Principia</i>, an explanation of the
waves of water (Lib. ii. Prop. 44), which appears to proceed upon an
erroneous view of the nature of the motion of the fluid: but in his
solution of the problem of sound, appeared, for the first time, a
correct view of the propagation of an undulation in a fluid. The
history of this subject, as bearing upon the theory of sound, is given
in <a href="#b8-3">Book viii.</a>: but I may here remark, that the
laws of the motion of waves have been pursued experimentally by
various persons, as Bremontier (<i>Recherches sur le Mouvement des
Ondes</i>, 1809), Emy (<i>Du Mouvement des Ondes</i>, 1831), the
Webers (<i>Wellenlehre</i>, 1825); and by Mr. Scott Russell
(<i>Reports of the British Association</i>, 1844). The analytical
theory has been carried on by Poisson, Cauchy, and, among ourselves,
by Prof. Kelland (<i>Edin. Trans.</i>) and Mr. Airy (in the article
<i>Tides</i>, in the <i>Encyclopædia Metropolitana</i>). And though
theory and experiment have not yet been brought into complete
accordance, great progress has been made in that work, and the
remaining chasm between the two is manifestly due only to the
incompleteness of both.]</p>
<p>Perhaps the most remarkable case of fluid motion recently
discussed, is one which Mr. Scott Russell has presented
experimentally; and which, though novel, is easily seen to follow from
known principles; namely, the <i>Great Solitary Wave</i>. A wave may
be produced, which shall move along a canal unaccompanied by any other
wave: and the simplicity of this case makes the mathematical
conditions and consequences more simple than they are in most other
problems of Hydrodynamics. <span class="pagenum"><a

<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Generalization of the Second
Law of Motion.&#8212;Central Forces.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> Second Law of Motion being
proved for constant Forces which act in parallel lines, and the Third
Law for the Direct Action of bodies, it still required great
mathematical talent, and some inductive power, to see clearly the laws
which govern the motion of any number of bodies, acted upon by each
other, and by any forces, anyhow varying in magnitude and direction.
This was the task of the generalization of the laws of motion.</p>
<p>Galileo had convinced himself that the velocity of projection, and
that which gravity alone would produce, are “both maintained, without
being altered, perturbed, or impeded in their mixture.” It is to be
observed, however, that the truth of this result depends upon a
particular circumstance, namely, that gravity, at all points, acts in
lines, which, as to sense, are parallel. When we have to consider
cases in which this is not true, as when the force tends to the centre
of a circle, the law of composition cannot be applied in the same way;
and, in this case, mathematicians were met by some peculiar
difficulties.</p>
<p>One of these difficulties arises from the apparent inconsistency of
the statical and dynamical measures of force. When a body moves in a
circle, the force which urges the body to the centre is only a
<em>tendency</em> to motion; for the body does not, in fact, approach
to the centre; and this mere tendency to motion is combined with an
actual motion, which takes place in the circumference. We appear to
have to compare two things which are heterogeneous. Descartes had
noticed this difficulty, but without giving any satisfactory solution
of it.<a id="fnanchor33-6" href="#note33-6"><span
class="fnanchor">33</span></a> If we combine the actual motion to or
from the centre with the traverse motion about the centre, we obtain a
result which is false on mechanical principles. Galileo endeavored in
this way to find the curve described by a body which falls towards the
earth’s centre, and is, at the same time, carried <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page353">353</a></span> round by the motion
of the earth; and obtained an erroneous result. Kepler and Fermat
attempted the same problem, and obtained solutions different from that
of Galileo, but not more correct.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note33-6"
href="#fnanchor33-6">33</a></span> <i>Princip.</i> P. iii. 59.</div>
<p>Even Newton, at an early period of his speculations, had an
erroneous opinion respecting this curve, which he imagined to be a
kind of spiral. Hooke animadverted upon this opinion when it was laid
before the Royal Society of London in 1679, and stated, more truly,
that, supposing no resistance, it would be “an eccentric ellipsoid,”
that is, a figure resembling an ellipse. But though he had made out
the approximate form of the curve, in some unexplained way, we have no
reason to believe that he possessed any means of determining the
mathematical properties of the curve described in such a case. The
perpetual composition of a central force with the previous motion of
the body, could not be successfully treated without the consideration
of the Doctrine of Limits, or something equivalent to that doctrine.
The first example which we have of the right solution of such a
problem occurs, so far as I know, in the Theorems of Huyghens
concerning Circular Motion, which were published, without
demonstration, at the end of his <i>Horologium Oscillatorium</i>, in
1673. It was there asserted that when equal bodies describe circles,
if the times are equal, the centrifugal forces will be as the
diameters of the circles; if the velocities are equal, the forces will
be reciprocally as the diameters, and so on. In order to arrive at
these propositions, Huyghens must, virtually at least, have applied
the Second Law of Motion to the limiting elements of the curve,
according to the way in which Newton, a few years later, gave the
demonstration of the theorems of Huyghens in the <i>Principia</i>.</p>
<p>The growing persuasion that the motions of the heavenly bodies
about the sun might be explained by the action of central forces, gave
a peculiar interest to these mechanical speculations, at the period
now under review. Indeed, it is not easy to state separately, as our
present object requires us to do, the progress of Mechanics, and the
progress of Astronomy. Yet the distinction which we have to make is,
in its nature, sufficiently marked. It is, in fact, no less marked
than the distinction between speaking logically and speaking truly.
The framers of the science of motion were employed in establishing
those notions, names, and rules, in conformity to which <em>all</em>
mechanical <em>truth must</em> be expressed; but <em>what was the
truth</em> with regard to the mechanism of the universe remained to be
determined by other means. Physical Astronomy, at the period of which
we speak, eclipsed and overlaid <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page354">354</a></span> theoretical Mechanics, as, a little
previously, Dynamics had eclipsed and superseded Statics.</p>
<p>The laws of variable force and of curvilinear motion were not much
pursued, till the invention of Fluxions and of the Differential
Calculus again turned men’s minds to these subjects, as easy and
interesting exercises of the powers of these new methods. Newton’s
<i>Principia</i>, of which the first two Books are purely dynamical,
is the great exception to this assertion; inasmuch as it contains
correct solutions of a great variety of the most general problems of
the science; and indeed is, even yet, one of the most complete
treatises which we possess upon the subject.</p>
<p>We have seen that Kepler, in his attempts to explain the
curvilinear motions of the planets by means of a central force,
failed, in consequence of his belief that a continued transverse
action of the central body was requisite to keep up a continual
motion. Galileo had founded his theory of projectiles on the principle
that such an action was not necessary; yet Borelli, a pupil of
Galileo, when, in 1666, he published his theory of the Medicean Stars
(the satellites of Jupiter), did not keep quite clear of the same
errors which had vitiated Kepler’s reasonings. In the same way, though
Descartes is sometimes spoken of as the first promulgator of the First
Law of Motion, yet his theory of Vortices must have been mainly
suggested by a want of an entire confidence in that law. When he
represented the planets and satellites as owing their motions to
oceans of fluid diffused through the celestial spaces, and constantly
whirling round the central bodies, he must have felt afraid of
trusting the planets to the operation of the laws of motion in free
space. Sounder physical philosophers, however, began to perceive the
real nature of the question. As early as 1666, we read, in the
Journals of the Royal Society, that “there was read a paper of Mr.
Hooke’s explicating the inflexion of a direct motion into a curve by a
supervening attractive principle;” and before the publication of the
<i>Principia</i> in 1687, Huyghens, as we have seen, in Holland, and,
in our own country, Wren, Halley, and Hooke, had made some progress in
the true mechanics of circular motion,<a id="fnanchor34-6"
href="#note34-6"><span class="fnanchor">34</span></a> and had
distinctly contemplated the problem of the motion of a body in an
ellipse by a central force, though they could not solve it. Halley
went to Cambridge in 1684,<a id="fnanchor35-6" href="#note35-6"><span
class="fnanchor">35</span></a> for the express purpose of consulting
Newton upon the subject of the production of the elliptical motion of
the planets by means of a central <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page355">355</a></span> force, and, on the 10th of December,<a
id="fnanchor36-6" href="#note36-6"><span
class="fnanchor">36</span></a> announced to the Royal Society that he
had seen Mr. Newton’s book, <i>De Motu Corporum</i>. The feeling that
mathematicians were on the brink of discoveries such as are contained
in this work was so strong, that Dr. Halley was requested to remind
Mr. Newton of his promise of entering them in the Register of the
Society, “for securing the invention to himself till such time as he
can be at leisure to publish it.” The manuscript, with the title
<i>Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica</i>, was presented to
the society (to which it was dedicated) on the 28th of April, 1686.
Dr. Vincent, who presented it, spoke of the novelty and dignity of the
subject; and the president (Sir J. Hoskins) added, with great truth,
“that the method was so much the more to be prized as it was both
invented and perfected at the same time.”</p>

<p>The reader will recollect that we are here speaking of the
<i>Principia</i> as a Mechanical Treatise only; we shall afterwards
have to consider it as containing the greatest discoveries of Physical
Astronomy. As a work on Dynamics, its merit is, that it exhibits a
wonderful store of refined and beautiful mathematical artifices,
applied to solve all the most general problems which the subject
offered. The <i>Principia</i> can hardly be said to contain any new
inductive discovery respecting the principles of mechanics; for though
Newton’s <i>Axioms or Laws of Motion</i> which stand at the beginning
of the book, are a much clearer and more general statement of the
grounds of Mechanics than had yet appeared, they do not involve any
doctrines which had not been previously stated or taken for granted by
other mathematicians.</p>
<p>The work, however, besides its unrivalled mathematical skill,
employed in tracing out, deductively, the consequences of the laws of
motion, and its great cosmical discoveries, which we shall hereafter
treat of, had great philosophical value in the history of Dynamics, as
exhibiting a clear conception of the new character and functions of
that science. In his Preface, Newton says, “Rational Mechanics must be
the science of the Motions which result from any Forces, and of the
Forces which are required for any Motions, accurately propounded and
demonstrated. For many things induce me to suspect, that all natural
phenomena may depend upon some Forces by which the particles of bodies
are either drawn towards each other, and cohere, or repel and recede
from each other: and these Forces being hitherto unknown, philosophers
have pursued their researches in vain. And I hope <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page356">356</a></span> that the principles
expounded in this work will afford some light, either to this mode of
philosophizing, or to some mode which is more true.”</p>
<p>Before we pursue this subject further, we must trace the remainder
of the history of the Third Law.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Generalization of the Third Law of
Motion.&#8212;Centre of Oscillation.&#8212;Huyghens.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> Third Law of Motion, whether expressed
according to Newton’s formula (by the equality of Action and
Reaction), or in any other of the ways employed about the same time,
easily gave the solution of mechanical problems in all cases of
<em>direct</em> action; that is, when each body acted directly on
others. But there still remained the problems in which the action is
<em>indirect</em>;&#8212;when bodies, in motion, act on each other by
the intervention of levers, or in any other way. If a rigid rod,
passing through two weights, be made to swing about its upper point,
so as to form a pendulum, each weight will act and react on the other
by means of the rod, considered as a lever turning about the point of
suspension. What, in this case, will be the effect of this action and
reaction? In what time will the pendulum oscillate by the force of
gravity? Where is the point at which a single weight must be placed to
oscillate in the same time? in other words, where is the <i>Centre of
Oscillation</i>?</p>
<p>Such was the problem&#8212;an example only of the general problem
of indirect action&#8212;which mathematicians had to solve. That it
was by no means easy to see in what manner the law of the
communication of motion was to be extended from simpler cases to those
where rotatory motion was produced, is shown by this;&#8212;that
Newton, in attempting to solve the mechanical problem of the
Precession of the Equinoxes, fell into a serious error on this very
subject. He assumed that, when a part has to communicate rotatory
movement to the whole (as the protuberant portion of the terrestrial
spheroid, attracted by the sun and moon, communicates a small movement
to the whole mass of the earth), the quantity of the <em>motion</em>,
“motus,” will not be altered by being communicated. This principle is
true, if, by <i>motion</i>, we understand what is called <i>moment of
inertia</i>, a quantity in which both the velocity of each particle
and its distance from the axis of rotation are taken into account: but
Newton, in his calculations of its amount, considered the velocity
only; thus making <i>motion</i>, in this case, identical with the
<i>momentum</i> which he introduces in treating of the simpler case
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page357">357</a></span> of the third
law of motion, when the action is direct. This error was retained even
in the later editions of the <i>Principia</i>.<a id="fnanchor37-6"

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note37-6"

<p>The question of the centre of oscillation had been proposed by
Mersenne somewhat earlier,<a id="fnanchor38-6" href="#note38-6"><span
class="fnanchor">38</span></a> in 1646. And though the problem was out
of the reach of any principles at that time known and understood, some
of the mathematicians of the day had rightly solved some cases of it,
by proceeding as if the question had been to find the <i>Centre of
Percussion</i>. The Centre of Percussion is the point about which the
momenta of all the parts of a body balance each other, when it is in
motion about any axis, and is stopped by striking against an obstacle
placed at that centre. Roberval found this point in some easy cases;
Descartes also attempted the problem; their rival labors led to an
angry controversy: and Descartes was, as in his physical speculations
he often was, very presumptuous, though not more than half right.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note38-6"
href="#fnanchor38-6">38</a></span> Mont. ii. 423.</div>
<p>Huyghens was hardly advanced beyond boyhood when Mersenne first
proposed this problem; and, as he says,<a id="fnanchor39-6"
href="#note39-6"><span class="fnanchor">39</span></a> could see no
principle which even offered an opening to the solution, and had thus
been repelled at the threshold. When, however, he published his
<i>Horologium Oscillatorium</i> in 1673, the fourth part of that work
was on the Centre of Oscillation or Agitation; and the principle which
he then assumed, though not so simple and self-evident as those to
which such problems were afterwards referred, was perfectly correct
and general, and led to exact solutions in all cases. The reader has
already seen repeatedly in the course of this history, complex and
derivative principles presenting themselves to men’s minds, before
simple and elementary ones. The “hypothesis” assumed by Huyghens was
this; “that if any weights are put in motion by the force of gravity,
they <em>cannot</em> move so that the centre of gravity of them all
shall rise <em>higher</em> than the place from which it descended.”
This being assumed, it is easy to show that the centre of gravity
will, under all circumstances, rise <em>as high</em> as its original
position; and this consideration leads to a determination of the
oscillation of a compound pendulum. We may observe, in the principle
thus selected, a conviction that, in all mechanical action, the centre
of gravity may be taken as the representative of the whole system.
This conviction, as we have seen, may be traced in the axioms of
Archimedes and Stevinus; and Huyghens, when he proceeds upon it,
undertakes to show,<a id="fnanchor40-6" href="#note40-6"><span
class="fnanchor">40</span></a> that he assumes only this, that a heavy
body cannot, of itself, move upwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page358">358</a></span> Clear as
Huyghen’s principle appeared to himself, it was, after some time,
attacked by the Abbé Catelan, a zealous Cartesian. Catelan also put
forth principles which he conceived were evident, and deduced from
them conclusions contradictory to those of Huyghens. His principles,
now that we know them to be false, appear to us very gratuitous. They
are these; “that in a compound pendulum, the sum of the velocities of
the component weights is equal to the sum of the velocities which they
would have acquired if they had been detached pendulums;” and “that
the time of the vibration of a compound pendulum is an arithmetic mean
between the times of the vibrations of the weights, moving as detached
pendulums.” Huyghens easily showed that these suppositions would make
the centre of gravity ascend to a greater height than that from which
it fell; and after some time, James Bernoulli stept into the arena,
and ranged himself on the side of Huyghens. As the discussion thus
proceeded, it began to be seen that the question really was, in what
manner the Third Law of Motion was to be extended to cases of indirect
action; whether by distributing the action and reaction according to
statical principles, or in some other way. “I propose it to the
consideration of mathematicians,” says Bernoulli in 1686, “what law of
the communication of velocity is observed by bodies in motion, which
are sustained at one extremity by a fixed fulcrum, and at the other by
a body also moving, but more slowly. Is the excess of velocity which
must be communicated from the one body to the other to be distributed
in the same proportion in which a load supported on the lever would be
distributed?” He adds, that if this question be answered in the
affirmative, Huyghens will be found to be in error; but this is a
mistake. The principle, that the action and reaction of bodies thus
moving are to be distributed according to the rules of the lever, is
true; but Bernoulli mistook, in estimating this action and reaction by
the <em>velocity</em> acquired at any moment; instead of taking, as he
should have done, the <em>increment</em> of velocity which gravity
tended to impress in the next instant. This was shown by the Marquis
de l’Hôpital; who adds, with justice, “I conceive that I have thus
fully answered the call of Bernoulli, when he says, I propose it to
the consideration of mathematicians, &amp;c.”</p>
<p>We may, from this time, consider as known, but not as fully
established, the principle that “When bodies in motion affect each
other, the action and reaction are distributed according to the laws
of Statics;” although there were still found occasional difficulties
in the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page359">359</a></span>
generalization and application of the role. James Bernoulli, in 1703,
gave “a General Demonstration of the Centre of Oscillation, drawn from
the nature of the Lever.” In this demonstration<a id="fnanchor41-6"
href="#note41-6"><span class="fnanchor">41</span></a> he takes as a
fundamental principle, that bodies in motion, connected by levers,
balance, when the products of their momenta and the lengths of the
levers are equal in opposite directions. For the proof of this
proposition, he refers to Marriotte, who had asserted it of weights
acting by percussion,<a id="fnanchor42-6" href="#note42-6"><span
class="fnanchor">42</span></a> and in order to prove it, had balanced
the effect of a weight on a lever by the effect of a jet of water, and
had confirmed it by other experiments.<a id="fnanchor43-6"
href="#note43-6"><span class="fnanchor">43</span></a> Moreover, says
Bernoulli, there is no one who denies it. Still, this kind of proof
was hardly satisfactory or elementary enough. John Bernoulli took up
the subject after the death of his brother James, which happened in
1705. The former published in 1714 his <i>Meditatio de Naturâ Centri
Oscillationis</i>. In this memoir, he assumes, as his brother had
done, that the effects of forces on a lever in motion are distributed
according to the common rules of the lever.<a id="fnanchor44-6"
href="#note44-6"><span class="fnanchor">44</span></a> The principal
generalization which he introduced was, that he considered gravity as
a force soliciting to motion, which might have different intensities
in different bodies. At the same time, Brook Taylor in England solved
the problem, upon the same principles as Bernoulli; and the question
of priority on this subject was one point in the angry intercourse
which, about this time, became common between the English
mathematicians and those of the Continent. Hermann also, in his
<i>Phoronomia</i>, published in 1716, gave a proof which, as he
informs us, he had devised before he saw John Bernoulli’s. This proof
is founded on the statical equivalence of the “<i>solicitations of
gravity</i>” and the “<i>vicarious solicitations</i>” which correspond
to the actual motion of each part; or, as it has been expressed by
more modern writers, the equilibrium of the <i>impressed</i> and
<i>effective forces</i>.</p>

<p>It was shown by John Bernoulli and Hermann, and was indeed easily
proved, that the proposition assumed by Huyghens as the foundation of
his solution, was, in fact, a consequence of the elementary principles
which belong to this branch of mechanics. But this assumption of
Huyghens was an example of a more general proposition, which by some
mathematicians at this time had been put forward as an original and
elementary law; and as a principle which ought to supersede the usual
measure of the forces of bodies in motion; this principle they called
“<i>the Conservation of Vis Viva</i>.” The attempt to <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page360">360</a></span> make this change was
the commencement of one of the most obstinate and curious of the
controversies which form part of the history of mechanical science.
The celebrated Leibnitz was the author of the new opinion. In 1686, he
published, in the Leipsic Acts, “A short Demonstration of a memorable
Error of Descartes and others, concerning the natural law by which
they think that God always preserves the same quantity of motion; in
which they pervert mechanics.” The principle that the same quantity of
motion, and therefore of moving force, is always preserved in the
world, follows from the equality of action and reaction; though
Descartes had, after his fashion, given a theological reason for it;
Leibnitz allowed that the quantity of moving force remains always the
same, but denied that this force is measured by the quantity of motion
or momentum. He maintained that the same force is requisite to raise a
weight of one pound through four feet, and a weight of four pounds
through one foot, though the momenta in this case are as one to two.
This was answered by the Abbé de Conti; who truly observed, that
allowing the effects in the two cases to be equal, this did not prove
the forces to be equal; since the effect, in the first case, was
produced in a double time, and therefore it was quite consistent to
suppose the force only half as great. Leibnitz, however, persisted in
his innovation; and in 1695 laid down the distinction between <i>vires
mortuæ</i>, or pressures, and <i>vires vivæ</i>, the name he gave to
his own measure of force. He kept up a correspondence with John
Bernoulli, whom he converted to his peculiar opinions on this subject;
or rather, as Bernoulli says,<a id="fnanchor45-6"
href="#note45-6"><span class="fnanchor">45</span></a> made him think
for himself, which ended in his proving directly that which Leibnitz
had defended by indirect reasons. Among other arguments, he had
pretended to show (what is certainly not true), that if the common
measure of forces be adhered to, a perpetual motion would be possible.
It is easy to collect many cases which admit of being very simply and
conveniently reasoned upon by means of the <i>vis viva</i>, that is,
by taking the force to be proportional to the <em>square</em> of the
velocity, and not to the velocity itself. Thus, in order to give the
arrow <em>twice</em> the velocity, the bow must be <em>four</em> times
as strong; and in all cases in which no account is taken of the time
of producing the effect, we may conveniently use similar methods.</p>

href="#fnanchor45-6">45</a></span> <i>Op.</i> iii. 40.</div>
<p>But it was not till a later period that the question excited any
general notice. The Academy of Sciences of Paris in 1724 proposed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page361">361</a></span> as a subject
for their prize dissertation the laws of the impact of bodies.
Bernoulli, as a competitor, wrote a treatise, upon Leibnitzian
principles, which, though not honored with the prize, was printed by
the Academy with commendation.<a id="fnanchor46-6"
href="#note46-6"><span class="fnanchor">46</span></a> The opinions
which he here defended and illustrated were adopted by several
mathematicians; the controversy extended from the mathematical to the
literary world, at that time more attentive than usual to mathematical
disputes, in consequence of the great struggle then going on between
the Cartesian and the Newtonian system. It was, however, obvious that
by this time the interest of the question, so far as the progress of
Dynamics was concerned, was at an end; for the combatants all agreed
as to the results in each particular case. The Laws of Motion were now
established; and the question was, by means of what definitions and
abstractions could they be best expressed;&#8212;a metaphysical, not a
physical discussion, and therefore one in which “the paper
philosophers,” as Galileo called them, could bear a part. In the first
volume of the <i>Transactions of the Academy of St. Petersburg</i>,
published in 1728, there are three Leibnitzian memoirs by Hermann,
Bullfinger, and Wolff. In England, Clarke was an angry assailant of
the German opinion, which S’Gravesande maintained. In France, Mairan
attacked the <i>vis viva</i> in 1728; “with strong and victorious
reasons,” as the Marquise du Chatelet declared, in the first edition
of her <i>Treatise on Fire</i>.<a id="fnanchor47-6"
href="#note47-6"><span class="fnanchor">47</span></a> But shortly
after this praise was published, the Chateau de Cirey, where the
Marquise usually lived, became a school of Leibnitzian opinions, and
the resort of the principal partisans of the <i>vis viva</i>. “Soon,”
observes Mairan, “their language was changed; the <i>vis viva</i> was
enthroned by the side of the <i>monads</i>.” The Marquise tried to
retract or explain away her praises; she urged arguments on the other
side. Still the question was not decided; even her friend Voltaire was
not converted. In 1741 he read a memoir <i>On the Measure and Nature
of Moving Forces</i>, in which he maintained the old opinion. Finally,
D’Alembert in 1743 declared it to be, as it truly was, a mere question
of words; and by the turn which Dynamics then took, it ceased to be of
any possible interest or importance to mathematicians.</p>

<p>The representation of the laws of motion and of the reasonings
depending on them, in the most general form, by means of analytical
language, cannot be said to have been fully achieved till the time of
D’Alembert; but as we have already seen, the discovery of these laws
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page362">362</a></span> had taken place
somewhat earlier; and that law which is more particularly expressed in
D’Alembert’s Principle (<i>the equality of the action gained and
lost</i>) was, it has been seen, rather led to by the general current
of the reasoning of mathematicians about the end of the seventeenth
century than discovered by any one. Huyghens, Marriotte, the two
Bernoulli’s, L’Hôpital, Taylor, and Hermann, have each of them their
name in the history of this advance; but we cannot ascribe to any of
them any great real inductive sagacity shown in what they thus
contributed, except to Huyghens, who first seized the principle in
such a form as to find the centre of oscillation by means of it.
Indeed, in the steps taken by the others, language itself had almost
made the generalization for them at the time when they wrote; and it
required no small degree of acuteness and care to distinguish the old
cases, in which the law had already been applied, from the new cases,
in which they had to apply it.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="sc">WE</span> have now finished the
history of the discovery of Mechanical Principles, strictly so called.
The three Laws of Motion, generalized in the manner we have described,
contain the materials of the whole structure of Mechanics; and in the
remaining progress of the science, we are led to no new truth which
was not implicitly involved in those previously known. It may be
thought, therefore, that the narrative of this progress is of
comparatively small interest. Nor do we maintain that the application
and development of principles is a matter of so much importance to the
philosophy of science, as the advance towards and to them. Still,
there are many circumstances in the latter stages of the progress of
the science of Mechanics, which well deserve notice, and make a rapid
survey of that part of its history indispensable to our purpose.</p>
<p>The Laws of Motion are expressed in terms of Space and Number; the
development of the consequences of these laws must, therefore, be
performed by means of the reasonings of mathematics; and the science
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page363">363</a></span> of Mechanics
may assume the various aspects which belong to the different modes of
dealing with mathematical quantities. Mechanics, like pure
mathematics, may be geometrical or may be analytical; that is, it may
treat space either by a direct consideration of its properties, or by
a symbolical representation of them: Mechanics, like pure mathematics,
may proceed from special cases, to problems and methods of extreme
generality;&#8212;may summon to its aid the curious and refined
relations of symmetry, by which general and complex conditions are
simplified;&#8212;may become more powerful by the discovery of more
powerful analytical artifices;&#8212;may even have the generality of
its principles further expanded, inasmuch as symbols are a more
general language than words. We shall very briefly notice a series of
modifications of this kind.</p>
<p>1. <i>Geometrical Mechanics. Newton, &amp;c.</i>&#8212;The first
great systematical Treatise on Mechanics, in the most general sense,
is the two first Books of the <i>Principia</i> of Newton. In this
work, the method employed is predominantly geometrical: not only space
is not represented symbolically, or by reference to number; but
numbers, as, for instance, those which measure time and force, are
represented by spaces; and the laws of their changes are indicated by
the properties of curve lines. It is well known that Newton employed,
by preference, methods of this kind in the exposition of his theorems,
even where he had made the discovery of them by analytical
calculations. The intuitions of space appeared to him, as they have
appeared to many of his followers, to be a more clear and satisfactory
road to knowledge, than the operations of symbolical language.
Hermann, whose <i>Phoronomia</i> was the next great work on this
subject, pursued a like course; employing curves, which he calls “the
scale of velocities,” “of forces,” &amp;c. Methods nearly similar were
employed by the two first Bernoullis, and other mathematicians of that
period; and were, indeed, so long familiar, that the influence of them
may still be traced in some of the terms which are used on such
subjects; as, for instance, when we talk of “reducing a problem to
quadratures,” that is, to the finding the area of the curves employed
in these methods.</p>
<p>2. <i>Analytical Mechanics. Euler.</i>&#8212;As analysis was more
cultivated, it gained a predominancy over geometry; being found to be
a far more powerful instrument for obtaining results; and possessing a
beauty and an evidence, which, though different from those of
geometry, had great attractions for minds to which they became
familiar. The person who did most to give to analysis the generality
and  <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page364">364</a></span> symmetry
which are now its pride, was also the person who made Mechanics
analytical; I mean Euler. He began his execution of this task in
various memoirs which appeared in the <i>Transactions of the Academy
of Sciences at St. Petersburg</i>, commencing with its earliest
volumes; and in 1736, he published there his <i>Mechanics, or the
Science of Motion analytically expounded; in the way of a Supplement
to the Transactions of the Imperial Academy of Sciences</i>. In the
preface to this work, he says, that though the solutions of problems
by Newton and Hermann were quite satisfactory, yet he found that he
had a difficulty in applying them to new problems, differing little
from theirs; and that, therefore, he thought it would be useful to
extract an analysis out of their synthesis.</p>
<p>3. <i>Mechanical Problems.</i>&#8212;In reality, however, Euler has
done much more than merely give analytical methods, which may be
applied to mechanical problems: he has himself applied such methods to
an immense number of cases. His transcendent mathematical powers, his
long and studious life, and the interest with which he pursued the
subject, led him to solve an almost inconceivable number and variety
of mechanical problems. Such problems suggested themselves to him on
all occasions. One of his memoirs begins, by stating that, happening
to think of the line of Virgil,</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0 bot">Anchora de prorà jacitur stant litore
puppes;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The anchor drops, the rushing keel is
staid;</span><br /></div></div>
<p class="noind">he could not help inquiring what would be the nature
of the ship’s motion under the circumstances here described. And in
the last few days of his life, after his mortal illness had begun,
having seen in the newspapers some statements respecting balloons, he
proceeded to calculate their motions; and performed a difficult
integration, in which this undertaking engaged him. His Memoirs occupy
a very large portion of the <i>Petropolitan Transactions</i> during
his life, from 1728 to 1783; and he declared that he should leave
papers which might enrich the publications of the Academy of
Petersburg for twenty years after his death;&#8212;a promise which has
been more than fulfilled; for, up to 1818, the volumes usually contain
several Memoirs of his. He and his contemporaries may be said to have
exhausted the subject; for there are few mechanical problems which
have been since treated, which they have not in some manner touched
upon.</p>
<p>I do not dwell upon the details of such problems; for the next
great step in Analytical Mechanics, the publication of D’Alembert’s
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page365">365</a></span> Principle in
1743, in a great degree superseded their interest. The Transactions of
the Academies of Paris and Berlin, as well as St. Petersburg, are
filled, up to this time, with various questions of this kind. They
require, for the most part, the determination of the motions of
several bodies, with or without weight, which pull or push each other
by means of threads, or levers, to which they are fastened, or along
which they can slide; and which, having a certain impulse given them
at first, are then left to themselves, or are compelled to move in
given lines and surfaces. The postulate of Huyghens, respecting the
motion of the centre of gravity, was generally one of the principles
of the solution; but other principles were always needed in addition
to this; and it required the exercise of ingenuity and skill to detect
the most suitable in each case. Such problems were, for some time, a
sort of trial of strength among mathematicians: the principle of
D’Alembert put an end to this kind of challenges, by supplying a
direct and general method of resolving, or at least of throwing into
equations, any imaginable problem. The mechanical difficulties were in
this way reduced to difficulties of pure mathematics.</p>
<p>4. <i>D’Alembert’s Principle.</i>&#8212;D’Alembert’s Principle is
only the expression, in the most general form, of the principle upon
which John Bernoulli, Hermann, and others, had solved the problem of
the centre of oscillation. It was thus stated, “The motion
<em>impressed</em> on each particle of any system by the forces which
act upon it, may be resolved into two, the <em>effective</em> motion,
and the motion gained or <em>lost</em>: the effective motions will be
the real motions of the parts, and the motions gained and lost will be
such as would keep the system at rest.” The distinction of
<i>statics</i>, the doctrine of equilibrium, and <i>dynamics</i>, the
doctrine of motion, was, as we have seen, fundamental; and the
difference of difficulty and complexity in the two subjects was well
understood, and generally recognized by mathematicians. D’Alembert’s
principle reduces every dynamical question to a statical one; and
hence, by means of the conditions which connect the possible motions
of the system, we can determine what the actual motions must be. The
difficulty of determining the laws of equilibrium, in the application
of this principle in complex cases is, however, often as great as if
we apply more simple and direct considerations.</p>
<p>5. <i>Motion in Resisting Media. Ballistics.</i>&#8212;We shall
notice more particularly the history of some of the problems of
mechanics. Though John Bernoulli always spoke with admiration of
Newton’s <i>Principia</i>, and of its author, he appears to have been
well disposed to point out <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page366">366</a></span> real or imagined blemishes in the work.
Against the validity of Newton’s determination of the path described
by a body projected in any part of the solar system, Bernoulli urges a
cavil which it is difficult to conceive that a mathematician, such as
he was, could seriously believe to be well founded. On Newton’s
determination of the path of a body in a resisting medium, his
criticism is more just. He pointed out a material error in this
solution: this correction came to Newton’s knowledge in London, in
October, 1712, when the impression of the second edition of the
Principia was just drawing to a close, under the care of Cotes at
Cambridge; and Newton immediately cancelled the leaf and corrected the
error.<a id="fnanchor48-6" href="#note48-6"><span
class="fnanchor">48</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note48-6"
href="#fnanchor48-6">48</a></span> MS. Correspondence in Trin. Coll.
Library.</div>
<p>This problem of the motion of a body in a resisting medium, led to
another collision between the English and the German mathematicians.
The proposition to which we have referred, gave only an indirect view
of the nature of the curve described by a projectile in the air; and
it is probable that Newton, when he wrote the <i>Principia</i>, did
not see his way to any direct and complete solution of this problem.
At a later period, in 1718, when the quarrel had waxed hot between the
admirers of Newton and Leibnitz, Keill, who had come forward as a
champion on the English side, proposed this problem to the foreigners
as a challenge. Keill probably imagined that what Newton had not
discovered, no one of his time would be able to discover. But the
sedulous cultivation of analysis by the Germans had given them
mathematical powers beyond the expectations of the English; who,
whatever might be their talents, had made little advance in the
effective use of general methods; and for a long period seemed to be
fascinated to the spot, in their admiration of Newton’s excellence.
Bernoulli speedily solved the problem; and reasonably enough,
according to the law of honor of such challenges, called upon the
challenger to produce his solution. Keill was unable to do this; and
after some attempts at procrastination, was driven to very paltry
evasions. Bernoulli then published his solution, with very just
expressions of scorn towards his antagonist. And this may, perhaps, be
considered as the first material addition which was made to the
<i>Principia</i> by subsequent writers.</p>
<p>6. <i>Constellation of Mathematicians.</i>&#8212;We pass with
admiration along the great series of mathematicians, by whom the
science of theoretical mechanics has been cultivated, from the time of
Newton to our own. There is no group of men of science whose fame is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page367">367</a></span> higher or
brighter. The great discoveries of Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, had
fixed all eyes on those portions of human knowledge on which their
successors employed their labors. The certainty belonging to this line
of speculation seemed to elevate mathematicians above the students of
other subjects; and the beauty of mathematical relations, and the
subtlety of intellect which may be shown in dealing with them, were
fitted to win unbounded applause. The successors of Newton and the
Bernoullis, as Euler, Clairaut, D’Alembert, Lagrange, Laplace, not to
introduce living names, have been some of the most remarkable men of
talent which the world has seen. That their talent is, for the most
part, of a different kind from that by which the laws of nature were
discovered, I shall have occasion to explain elsewhere; for the
present, I must endeavor to arrange the principal achievements of
those whom I have mentioned.</p>
<p>The series of persons is connected by social relations. Euler was
the pupil of the first generation of Bernoullis, and the intimate
friend of the second generation; and all these extraordinary men, as
well as Hermann, were of the city of Basil, in that age a spot fertile
of great mathematicians to an unparalleled degree. In 1740, Clairaut
and Maupertuis visited John Bernoulli, at that time the Nestor of
mathematicians, who died, full of age and honors, in 1748. Euler,
several of the Bernoullis, Maupertuis, Lagrange, among other
mathematicians of smaller note, were called into the north by
Catharine of Russia and Frederic of Prussia, to inspire and instruct
academies which the brilliant fame then attached to science, had
induced those monarchs to establish. The prizes proposed by these
societies, and by the French Academy of Sciences, gave occasion to
many of the most valuable mathematical works of the century.</p>
<p id="b6-6-7">7. <i>The Problem of Three Bodies.</i>&#8212;In 1747,
Clairaut and D’Alembert sent, on the same day, to this body, their
solutions of the celebrated “Problem of Three Bodies,” which, from
that time, became the great object of attention of
mathematicians;&#8212;the bow in which each tried his strength, and
endeavored to shoot further than his predecessors.</p>
<p>This problem was, in fact, the astronomical question of the effect
produced by the attraction of the sun, in disturbing the motions of
the moon about the earth; or by the attraction of one planet,
disturbing the motion of another planet about the sun; but being
expressed generally, as referring to one body which disturbs any two
others, it became a mechanical problem, and the history of it belongs
to the present subject. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page368">368</a></span></p>
<p>One consequence of the synthetical form adopted by Newton in the
<i>Principia</i>, was, that his successors had the problem of the
solar system to begin entirely anew. Those who would not do this, made
no progress, as was long the case with the English. Clairaut says,
that he tried for a long time to make some use of Newton’s labors; but
that, at last, he resolved to take up the subject in an independent
manner. This, accordingly, he did, using analysis throughout, and
following methods not much different from those still employed. We do
not now speak of the comparison of this theory with observation,
except to remark, that both by the agreements and by the discrepancies
of this comparison, Clairaut and other writers were perpetually driven
on to carry forwards the calculation to a greater and greater degree
of accuracy.</p>
<p>One of the most important of the cases in which this happened, was
that of the movement of the Apogee of the Moon; and in this case, a
mode of approximating to the truth, which had been depended on as
nearly exact, was, after having caused great perplexity, found by
Clairaut and Euler to give only half the truth. This same Problem of
Three Bodies was the occasion of a memoir of Clairaut, which gained
the prize of the Academy of St. Petersburg in 1751; and, finally, of
his <i>Théorie de la Lune</i>, published in 1765. D’Alembert labored
at the same time on the same problem; and the value of their methods,
and the merit of the inventors, unhappily became a subject of
controversy between those two great mathematicians. Euler also, in
1753, published a <i>Theory of the Moon</i>, which was, perhaps, more
useful than either of the others, since it was afterwards the basis of
Mayer’s method, and of his Tables. It is difficult to give the general
reader any distinct notion of these solutions. We may observe, that
the quantities which determine the moon’s position, are to be
determined by means of certain algebraical equations, which express
the mechanical conditions of the motion. The operation, by which the
result is to be obtained, involves the process of integration; which,
in this instance, cannot be performed in an immediate and definite
manner; since the quantities thus to be operated on depend upon the
moon’s position, and thus require us to know the very thing which we
have to determine by the operation. The result must be got at,
therefore, by successive approximations: we must first find a quantity
near the truth; and then, by the help of this, one nearer still; and
so on; and, in this manner, the moon’s place will be given by a
converging series of terms. The form of these terms depends upon the
relations of position between the sun <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page369">369</a></span> and moon, their apogees, the moon’s
nodes, and other quantities; and by the variety of combinations of
which these admit, the terms become very numerous and complex. The
magnitude of the terms depends also upon various circumstances; as the
relative force of the sun and earth, the relative times of the solar
and lunar revolutions, the eccentricities and inclinations of the two
orbits. These are combined so as to give terms of different orders of
magnitudes; and it depends upon the skill and perseverance of the
mathematician how far he will continue this series of terms. For there
is no limit to their number: and though the methods of which we have
spoken do theoretically enable us to calculate as many terms as we
please, the labor and the complexity of the operations are so serious
that common calculators are stopped by them. None but very great
mathematicians have been able to walk safely any considerable distance
into this avenue,&#8212;so rapidly does it darken as we proceed. And
even the possibility of doing what has been done, depends upon what we
may call accidental circumstances; the smallness of the inclinations
and eccentricities of the system, and the like. “If nature had not
favored us in this way,” Lagrange used to say, “there would have been
an end of the geometers in this problem.” The expected return of the
comet of 1682 in 1759, gave a new interest to the problem, and
Clairaut proceeded to calculate the case which was thus suggested.
When this was treated by the methods which had succeeded for the moon,
it offered no prospect of success, in consequence of the absence of
the favorable circumstances just referred to, and, accordingly,
Clairaut, after obtaining the six equations to which he reduces the
solution,<a id="fnanchor49-6" href="#note49-6"><span
class="fnanchor">49</span></a> adds, “Integrate them who can” (Intègre
maintenant qui pourra). New methods of approximation were devised for
this case.</p>

<p>The problem of three bodies was not prosecuted in consequence of
its analytical beauty, or its intrinsic attraction; but its great
difficulties were thus resolutely combated from necessity; because in
no other way could the theory of universal gravitation be known to be
true or made to be useful. The construction of <i>Tables of the
Moon</i>, an object which offered a large pecuniary reward, as well as
mathematical glory, to the successful adventurer, was the main purpose
of these labors.</p>
<p>The <i>Theory of the Planets</i> presented the Problem of Three
Bodies in a new form, and involved in peculiar difficulties; for the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page370">370</a></span> approximations
which succeed in the Lunar theory fail here. Artifices somewhat
modified are required to overcome the difficulties of this case.</p>
<p>Euler had investigated, in particular, the motions of Jupiter and
Saturn, in which there was a secular acceleration and retardation,
known by observation, but not easily explicable by theory. Euler’s
memoirs, which gained the prize of the French Academy, in 1748 and
1752, contained much beautiful analysis; and Lagrange published also a
theory of Jupiter and Saturn, in which he obtained results different
from those of Euler. Laplace, in 1787, showed that this inequality
arose from the circumstance that two of Saturn’s years are very nearly
equal to five of Jupiter’s.</p>
<p>The problems relating to Jupiter’s <i>Satellites</i>, were found to
be even more complex than those which refer to the planets: for it was
necessary to consider each satellite as disturbed by the other three
at once; and thus there occurred the Problem of <i>Five</i> Bodies.
This problem was resolved by Lagrange.<a id="fnanchor50-6"

<p>Again, the newly-discovered <i>small Planets</i>, Juno, Ceres,
Vesta, Pallas, whose orbits almost coincide with each other, and are
more inclined and more eccentric than those of the ancient planets,
give rise, by their perturbations, to new forms of the problem, and
require new artifices.</p>
<p>In the course of these researches respecting Jupiter, Lagrange and
Laplace were led to consider particularly the <i>secular
Inequalities</i> of the solar system; that is, those inequalities in
which the duration of the cycle of change embraces very many
revolutions of the bodies themselves. Euler in 1749 and 1755, and
Lagrange<a id="fnanchor51-6" href="#note51-6"><span
class="fnanchor">51</span></a> in 1766, had introduced the method of
the <i>Variation of the Elements</i> of the orbit; which consists in
tracing the effect of the perturbing forces, not as directly altering
the place of the planet, but as producing a change from one instant to
another, in the dimensions and position of the Elliptical orbit which
the planet describes.<a id="fnanchor52-6" href="#note52-6"><span
class="fnanchor">52</span></a> Taking this view, he <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page371">371</a></span> determines the
secular changes of each of the <i>elements</i> or determining
quantities of the orbit. In 1773, Laplace also attacked this subject
of secular changes, and obtained expressions for them. On this
occasion, he proved the celebrated proposition that, “the mean motions
of the planets are invariable:” that is, that there is, in the
revolutions of the system, no progressive change which is not finally
stopped and reversed; no increase, which is not, after some period,
changed into decrease; no retardation which is not at last succeeded
by acceleration; although, in some cases, millions of years may elapse
before the system reaches the turning-point. Thomas Simpson noticed
the same consequence of the laws of universal attraction. In 1774 and
1776, Lagrange<a id="fnanchor53-6" href="#note53-6"><span
class="fnanchor">53</span></a> still labored at the secular equations;
extending his researches to the nodes and inclinations; and showed
that the invariability of the mean motions of the planets, which
Laplace had proved, neglecting the fourth powers of the eccentricities
and inclinations of the orbits,<a id="fnanchor54-6"
href="#note54-6"><span class="fnanchor">54</span></a> was true,
however far the approximation was carried, so long as the squares of
the disturbing masses were neglected. He afterwards improved his
methods;<a id="fnanchor55-6" href="#note55-6"><span
class="fnanchor">55</span></a> and, in 1783, he endeavored to extend
the calculation of the changes of the elements to the periodical
equations, as well as the secular.</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note52-6"
href="#fnanchor52-6">52</a></span> In the first edition of this
History, I had ascribed to Lagrange the invention of the Method of
Variation of Elements in the theory of Perturbations. But justice to
Euler requires that we should assign this distinction to him; at
least, next to Newton, whose mode of representing the paths of bodies
by means of a <i>Revolving Orbit</i>, in the Ninth Section of the
<i>Principia</i>, may be considered as an anticipation of the method
of variation of elements. In the fifth volume of the <i>Mécanique
Céleste</i>, livre xv. p. 305, is an abstract of Euler’s paper of
1749; where Laplace adds, “C’est le premier essai de la méthode de la
variation des constantes arbitraires.” And in page 310 is an abstract
of the paper of 1756: and speaking of the method, Laplace says, “It
consists in regarding the elements of the elliptical motion as
variable in virtue of the perturbing forces. Those elements are, 1,
the axis major; 2, the epoch of the body being at the apse; 3, the
eccentricity; 4, the movement of the apse; 5, the inclination; 6, the
longitude of the node;” and he then proceeds to show how Euler did
this. It is possible that Lagrange knew nothing of Euler’s paper. See
<i>Méc. Cél.</i> vol. v. p. 312. But Euler’s conception and treatment
of the method are complete, so that he must be looked upon as the
author of it.</div>

<p>8. <i>Mécanique Céleste</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>&#8212;Laplace also
resumed the consideration of the secular changes; and, finally,
undertook his vast work, the <i>Mécanique Céleste</i>, which he
intended to contain a complete view of the existing state of this
splendid department of science. We may see, in the exultation which
the author obviously feels at the thought of erecting this monument of
his age, the enthusiasm which had been excited by the splendid course
of mathematical successes of which I have given a sketch. The two
first volumes of this great work appeared in 1799. The third and
fourth volumes were published in 1802 and 1805 respectively. Since its
publication, little has been added to the solution of the great
problems of which it treats. In 1808, Laplace presented to the French
Bureau des Longitudes, a Supplement to the <i>Mécanique Céleste</i>;
the object of which was to improve still further <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page372">372</a></span> the mode of obtaining
the secular variations of the elements. Poisson and Lagrange proved
the invariability of the major axes of the orbits, as far as the
second order of the perturbing forces. Various other authors have
since labored at this subject. Burckhardt, in 1808, extended the
perturbing function as far as the sixth order of the eccentricities.
Gauss, Hansen, and Bessel, Ivory, MM. Lubbock, Plana, Pontécoulant,
and Airy, have, at different periods up to the present time, either
extended or illustrated some particular part of the theory, or applied
it to special cases; as in the instance of Professor Airy’s
calculation of an inequality of Venus and the earth, of which the
period is 240 years. The approximation of the Moon’s motions has been
pushed to an almost incredible extent by M. Damoiseau, and, finally,
Plana has once more attempted to present, in a single work (three
thick quarto volumes), all that has hitherto been executed with regard
to the theory of the Moon.</p>
<p>I give only the leading points of the progress of analytical
dynamics. Hence I have not spoken in detail of the theory of the
Satellites of Jupiter, a subject on which Lagrange gained a prize for
a Memoir, in 1766, and in which Laplace discovered some most curious
properties in 1784. Still less have I referred to the purely
speculative question of <i>Tautochronous Curves</i> in a resisting
medium, though it was a subject of the labors of Bernoulli, Euler,
Fontaine, D’Alembert, Lagrange, and Laplace. The reader will rightly
suppose that many other curious investigations are passed over in
utter silence.</p>
<p>[2d Ed.] [Although the analytical calculations of the great
mathematicians of the last century had determined, in a demonstrative
manner, a vast series of inequalities to which the motions of the sun,
moon, and planets were subject in virtue of their mutual attraction,
there were still unsatisfactory points in the solutions thus given of
the great mechanical problems suggested by the System of the Universe.
One of these points was the want of any evident mechanical
significance in the successive members of these series. Lindenau
relates that Lagrange, near the end of his life, expressed his sorrow
that the methods of approximation employed in Physical Astronomy
rested on arbitrary processes, and not on any insight into the results
of mechanical action. But something was subsequently done to remove
the ground of this complaint. In 1818, Gauss pointed out that secular
equations may be conceived to result from the disturbing body being
distributed along its orbit so as to form a ring, and thus made the
result conceivable more distinctly than as a mere result of
calculation. And it appears <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page373">373</a></span> to me that Professor Airy’s treatise
entitled <i>Gravitation</i>, published at Cambridge in 1834, is of
great value in supplying similar modes of conception with regard to
the mechanical origin of many of the principal inequalities of the
solar system.</p>
<p>Bessel in 1824, and Hansen in 1828, published works which are
considered as belonging, along with those of Gauss, to a new era in
physical astronomy.<a id="fnanchor56-6" href="#note56-6"><span
class="fnanchor">56</span></a> Gauss’s <i>Theoria Motuum Corporum
Celestium</i>, which had Lalande’s medal assigned to it by the French
Institute, had already (1810) resolved all problems concerning the
determination of the place of a planet or comet in its orbit in
function of the elements. The value of Hansen’s labors respecting the
Perturbations of the Planets was recognized by the Astronomical
Society of London, which awarded to them its gold medal.</p>

<p>The investigations of M. Damoiseau, and of MM. Plana and Carlini,
on the Problem of the Lunar Theory, followed nearly the same course as
those of their predecessors. In these, as in the <i>Mécanique
Céleste</i> and in preceding works on the same subject, the Moon’s
co-ordinates (time, radius vector, and latitude) were expressed in
function of her true longitude. The integrations were effected in
series, and then by reversion of the series, the longitude was
expressed in function of the time; and then in the same manner the
other two co-ordinates. But Sir John Lubbock and M. Pontécoulant have
made the <em>mean</em> longitude of the moon, that is, the time, the
independent variable, and have expressed the moon’s co-ordinates in
terms of sines and cosines of angles increasing proportionally to the
time. And this method has been adopted by M. Poisson (<i>Mem.
Inst.</i> xiii. 1835, p. 212). M. Damoiseau, like Laplace and
Clairaut, had deduced the successive coefficients of the lunar
inequalities by numerical equations. But M. Plana expresses explicitly
each coefficient in general terms of the letters expressing the
constants of the problem, arranging them according to the order of the
quantities, and substituting numbers at the end of the operation only.
By attending to this arrangement, MM. Lubbock and Pontécoulant have
verified or corrected a large portion of the terms contained in the
investigations of MM. Damoiseau and Plana. Sir John Lubbock has
calculated the polar co-ordinates of the Moon directly; M. Poisson, on
the other hand, has obtained the variable elliptical elements; M.
Pontécoulant conceives that the method of variation or arbitrary <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page374">374</a></span> constants may most
conveniently be reserved for secular inequalities and inequalities of
long periods.</p>
<p>MM. Lubbock and Pontécoulant have made the mode of treating the
Lunar Theory and the Planetary Theory agree with each other, instead
of following two different paths in the calculation of the two
problems, which had previously been done.</p>
<p>Prof. Hansen, also, in his <i>Fundamenta Nova Investigationis
Orbitæ veræ quam Luna perlustrat</i> (<i>Gothæ</i>, 1838), gives a
general method, including the Lunar Theory and the Planetary Theory as
two special cases. To this is annexed a solution of the <i>Problem of
Four Bodies</i>.</p>
<p>I am here speaking of the Lunar and Planetary Theories as
Mechanical Problems only. Connected with this subject, I will not omit
to notice a very general and beautiful method of solving problems
respecting the motion of systems <span class="correction"
title="omitted in text">of</span> mutually attracting bodies, given by
Sir W. R. Hamilton, in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> for
1834&#8211;5 (“On a General Method in Dynamics”). His method consists
in investigating the <i>Principal Function</i> of the co-ordinates of
the bodies: this function being one, by the differentiation of which,
the co-ordinates of the bodies of the system may be found. Moreover,
an approximate value of this function being obtained, the same formulæ
supply a means of successive approximation without limit.]</p>
<p>9. <i>Precession. Motion of Rigid Bodies.</i>&#8212;The series of
investigations of which I have spoken, extensive and complex as it is,
treats the moving bodies as points only, and takes no account of any
peculiarity of their form or motion of their parts. The investigation
of the motion of a body of any magnitude and form, is another branch
of analytical mechanics, which well deserves notice. Like the former
branch, it mainly owed its cultivation to the problems suggested by
the solar system. Newton, as we have seen, endeavored to calculate the
effect of the attraction of the sun and moon in producing the
<i>precession of the equinoxes</i>; but in doing this he made some
mistakes. In 1747, D’Alembert solved this problem by the aid of his
“Principle;” and it was not difficult for him to show, as he did in
his <i>Opuscules</i>, in 1761, that the same method enabled him to
determine the motion of a body of any figure acted upon by any forces.
But, as the reader will have observed in the course of this narrative,
the great mathematicians of this period were always nearly abreast of
each other in their advances.&#8212;Euler,<a id="fnanchor57-6"
href="#note57-6"><span class="fnanchor">57</span></a> in the mean
time, had published, in 1751, a solution of the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page375">375</a></span> problem of the
precession; and in 1752, a memoir which he entitled <i>Discovery of a
New Principle of Mechanics</i>, and which contains a solution of the
general problem of the alteration of rotary motion by forces.
D’Alembert noticed with disapprobation the assumption of priority
which this title implied, though allowing the merit of the memoir.
Various improvements were made in these solutions; but the final form
was given them by Euler; and they were applied to a great variety of
problems in his <i>Theory of the Motion of Solid and Rigid Bodies</i>,
which was written<a id="fnanchor58-6" href="#note58-6"><span
class="fnanchor">58</span></a> about 1760, and published in 1765. The
formulæ in this work were much simplified by the use of a discovery of
Segner, that every body has three axes which were called Principal
Axes, about which alone (in general) it would permanently revolve. The
equations which Euler and other writers had obtained, were attacked as
erroneous by Landen in the Philosophical Transactions for 1785; but I
think it is impossible to consider this criticism otherwise than as an
example of the inability of the English mathematicians of that period
to take a steady hold of the analytical generalizations to which the
great Continental authors had been led. Perhaps one of the most
remarkable calculations of the motion of a rigid body is that which
Lagrange performed with regard to the <i>Moon’s Libration</i>; and by
which he showed that the Nodes of the Moon’s Equator and those of her
Orbit must always coincide.</p>

<p>10. <i>Vibrating Strings.</i>&#8212;Other mechanical questions,
unconnected with astronomy, were also pursued with great zeal and
success. Among these was the problem of a vibrating string, stretched
between two fixed points. There is not much complexity in the
mechanical conceptions which belong to this case, but considerable
difficulty in reducing them to analysis. Taylor, in his <i>Method of
Increments</i>, published in 1716, had annexed to his work a solution
of this problem; obtained on suppositions, limited indeed, but
apparently conformable to the most common circumstances of practice.
John Bernoulli, in 1728, had also treated the same problem. But it
assumed an interest altogether new, when, in 1747, D’Alembert
published his views on the subject; in which he maintained that,
instead of one kind of curve only, there were an infinite number of
different curves, which answered the conditions of the question. The
problem, thus put forward by one great mathematician, was, as usual,
taken up by the others, whose names the reader is now so familiar with
in such an association. In <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page376">376</a></span> 1748, Euler not only assented to the
generalization of D’Alembert, but held that it was not necessary that
the curves so introduced should be defined by any algebraical
condition whatever. From this extreme indeterminateness D’Alembert
dissented; while Daniel Bernoulli, trusting more to physical and less
to analytical reasonings, maintained that both these generalizations
were inapplicable in fact, and that the solution was really
restricted, as had at first been supposed, to the form of the
trochoid, and to other forms derivable from that. He introduced, in
such problems, the “Law of Coexistent Vibrations,” which is of eminent
use in enabling us to conceive the results of complex mechanical
conditions, and the real import of many analytical expressions. In the
mean time, the wonderful analytical genius of Lagrange had applied
itself to this problem. He had formed the Academy of Turin, in
conjunction with his friends Saluces and Cigna; and the first memoir
in their Transactions was one by him on this subject: in this and in
subsequent writings he has established, to the satisfaction of the
mathematical world, that the functions introduced in such cases are
not necessarily continuous, but are arbitrary to the same degree that
the motion is so practically; though capable of expression by a series
of circular functions. This controversy, concerning the degree of
lawlessness with which the conditions of the solution may be assumed,
is of consequence, not only with respect to vibrating strings, but
also with respect to many problems, belonging to a branch of Mechanics
which we now have to mention, the Doctrine of Fluids.</p>
<p>11. <i>Equilibrium of Fluids. Figure of the Earth.
Tides.</i>&#8212;The application of the general doctrines of Mechanics
to fluids was a natural and inevitable step, when the principles of
the science had been generalized. It was easily seen that a fluid is,
for this purpose, nothing more than a body of which the parts are
movable amongst each other with entire facility; and that the
mathematician must trace the consequences of this condition upon his
equations. This accordingly was done, by the founders of mechanics,
both for the cases of the equilibrium and of motion. Newton’s attempt
to solve the problem of the <i>figure of the earth</i>, supposing it
fluid, is the first example of such an investigation: and this
solution rested upon principles which we have already explained,
applied with the skill and sagacity which distinguished all that
Newton did.</p>
<p>We have <a href="#v1page345">already</a> seen how the generality of
the principle, that fluids press equally in all directions, was
established. In applying it to calculation, Newton took for his
fundamental principle, the equal <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page377">377</a></span> weight of columns of the fluid reaching
to the centre; Huyghens took, as his basis, the <span
class="correction" title="emended from
prependicularity">perpendicularity</span> of the resulting force at
each point to the surface of the fluid; Bouguer conceived that both
principles were necessary; and Clairaut showed that the equilibrium of
<em>all</em> canals is requisite. He also was the first mathematician
who deduced from this principle the Equations of Partial Differentials
by which these laws are expressed; a step which, as Lagrange says,<a
id="fnanchor59-6" href="#note59-6"><span
class="fnanchor">59</span></a> changed the face of Hydrostatics, and
made it a new science. Euler simplified the mode of obtaining the
Equations of Equilibrium for any forces whatever; and put them in the
form which is now generally adopted in our treatises.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note59-6"
href="#fnanchor59-6">59</a></span> <i>Méc. Analyt.</i> ii. p.
180.</div>
<p>The explanation of the <i>Tides</i>, in the way in which Newton
attempted it in the third book of the <i>Principia</i>, is another
example of a hydrostatical investigation: for he considered only the
form that the ocean would have if it were at rest. The memoirs of
Maclaurin, Daniel Bernoulli, and Euler, on the question of the Tides,
which shared among them the prize of the Academy of Sciences in 1740,
went upon the same views.</p>
<p>The <i>Treatise of the Figure of the Earth</i>, by Clairaut, in
1743, extended Newton’s solution of the same problem, by supposing a
solid nucleus covered with a fluid of different density. No peculiar
novelty has been introduced into this subject, except a method
employed by Laplace for determining the attractions of spheroids of
small eccentricity, which is, as Professor Airy has said,<a
id="fnanchor60-6" href="#note60-6"><span
class="fnanchor">60</span></a> “a calculus the most singular in its
nature, and the most powerful in its effects, of any which has yet
appeared.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note60-6"
href="#fnanchor60-6">60</a></span> <i>Enc. Met.</i> Fig. of Earth, p.
192.</div>
<p>12. <i>Capillary Action.</i>&#8212;There is only one other problem
of the statics of fluids on which it is necessary to say a
word,&#8212;the doctrine of Capillary Attraction. Daniel Bernoulli,<a
id="fnanchor61-6" href="#note61-6"><span
class="fnanchor">61</span></a> in 1738, states that he passes over the
subject, because he could not reduce the facts to general laws: but
Clairaut was more successful, and Laplace and Poisson have since given
great analytical completeness to his theory. At present our business
is, not so much with the sufficiency of the theory to explain
phenomena, as with the mechanical problem of which this is an example,
which is one of a very remarkable and important character; namely, to
determine the effect of attractions which are exercised by all the
particles of bodies, on the hypothesis that the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page378">378</a></span> attraction of each
particle, though sensible when it acts upon another particle at an
extremely small distance from it, becomes insensible and vanishes the
moment this distance assumes a perceptible magnitude. It may easily be
imagined that the analysis by which results are obtained under
conditions so general and so peculiar, is curious and abstract; the
problem has been resolved in some very extensive cases.</p>

<p>13. <i>Motion of Fluids.</i>&#8212;The only branch of mathematical
mechanics which remains to be considered, is that which is, we may
venture to say, hitherto incomparably the most incomplete of
all,&#8212;Hydrodynamics. It may easily be imagined that the mere
hypothesis of absolute relative mobility in the parts, combined with
the laws of motion and nothing more, are conditions too vague and
general to lead to definite conclusions. Yet such are the conditions
of the problems which relate to the motion of fluids. Accordingly, the
mode of solving them has been, to introduce certain other hypotheses,
often acknowledged to be false, and almost always in some measure
arbitrary, which may assist in determining and obtaining the solution.
The Velocity of a fluid issuing from an orifice in a vessel, and the
Resistance which a solid body suffers in moving in a fluid, have been
the two main problems on which mathematicians have employed
themselves. We have already spoken of the manner in which Newton
attacked both these, and endeavored to connect them. The subject
became a branch of Analytical Mechanics by the labors of D. Bernoulli,
whose <i>Hydrodynamica</i> was published in 1738. This work rests upon
the Huyghenian principle of which we have <a
href="#v1page357">already</a> spoken in the history of the centre of
oscillation; namely, the equality of the <em>actual descent</em> of
the particles and the <em>potential ascent</em>; or, in other words,
the conservation of <i>vis viva</i>. This was the first analytical
treatise; and the analysis is declared by Lagrange to be as elegant in
its steps as it is simple in its results. Maclaurin also treated the
subject; but is accused of reasoning in such a way as to show that he
had determined upon his result beforehand; and the method of John
Bernoulli, who likewise wrote upon it, has been strongly objected to
by D’Alembert. D’Alembert himself applied the principle which bears
his name to this subject; publishing a <i>Treatise on the Equilibrium
and Motion of Fluids</i> in 1744, and on the <i>Resistance of
Fluids</i> in 1753. His <i>Réflexions sur la Cause Générale des
Vents</i>, printed in 1747, are also a celebrated work, belonging to
this part of mathematics. Euler, in this as in other cases, was one of
those who most contributed to give analytical elegance to the subject.
In addition to the questions which <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page379">379</a></span> have been mentioned, he and Lagrange
treated the problems of the small vibrations of fluids, both inelastic
and elastic;&#8212;a subject which leads, like the question of
vibrating strings, to some subtle and abstruse considerations
concerning the significations of the integrals of partial differential
equations. Laplace also took up the subject of waves propagated along
the surface of water; and deduced a very celebrated theory of the
tides, in which he considered the ocean to be, not in equilibrium, as
preceding writers had supposed, but agitated by a constant series of
undulations, produced by the solar and lunar forces. The difficulty of
such an investigation may be judged of from this, that Laplace, in
order to carry it on, is obliged to assume a mechanical proposition,
unproved, and only conjectured to be true; namely,<a id="fnanchor62-6"
href="#note62-6"><span class="fnanchor">62</span></a> that, “in a
system of bodies acted upon by forces which are periodical, the state
of the system is periodical like the forces.” Even with this
assumption, various other arbitrary processes are requisite; and it
appears still very doubtful whether Laplace’s theory is either a
better mechanical solution of the problem, or a nearer approximation
to the laws of the phenomena, than that obtained by D. Bernoulli,
following the views of Newton.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note62-6"
href="#fnanchor62-6">62</a></span> <i>Méc. Cél.</i> t. ii. p.
218.</div>
<p>In most cases, the solutions of problems of hydrodynamics are not
satisfactorily confirmed by the results of observation. Poisson and
Cauchy have prosecuted the subject of waves, and have deduced very
curious conclusions by a very recondite and profound analysis. The
assumptions of the mathematician here do not represent the conditions
of nature; the rules of theory, therefore, are not a good standard to
which we may refer the aberrations of particular cases; and the laws
which we obtain from experiment are very imperfectly illustrated by
<i>à priori</i> calculation. The case of this department of knowledge,
Hydrodynamics, is very peculiar; we have reached the highest point of
the science,&#8212;the laws of extreme simplicity and generality from
which the phenomena flow; we cannot doubt that the ultimate principles
which we have obtained are the true ones, and those which really apply
to the facts; and yet we are far from being able to apply the
principles to explain or find out the facts. In order to do this, we
want, in addition to what we have, true and useful principles,
intermediate between the highest and the lowest;&#8212;between the
extreme and almost barren generality of the laws of motion, and the
endless varieties and inextricable complexity of fluid motions in
special cases. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page380">380</a></span>
The reason of this peculiarity in the science of Hydrodynamics appears
to be, that its general principles were not discovered with reference
to the science itself, but by extension from the sister science of the
Mechanics of Solids; they were not obtained by ascending gradually
from particulars, to truths more and more general, respecting the
motions of fluids; but were caught at once, by a perception that the
parts of fluids are included in that range of generality which we are
entitled to give to the supreme laws of motions of solids. Thus, Solid
Dynamics and Fluid Dynamics resemble two edifices which have their
highest apartment in common, and though we can explore every part of
the former building, we have not yet succeeded in traversing the
staircase of the latter, either from the top or from the bottom. If we
had lived in a world in which there were no solid bodies, we should
probably not have yet discovered the laws of motion; if we had lived
in a world in which there were no fluids, we should have no idea how
insufficient a complete possession of the general laws of motion may
be, to give us a true knowledge of particular results.</p>
<p>14. <i>Various General Mechanical Principles.</i>&#8212;The
generalized laws of motion, the points to which I have endeavored to
conduct my history, include in them all other laws by which the
motions of bodies can be regulated; and among such, several laws which
had been discovered before the highest point of generalization was
reached, and which thus served as stepping-stones to the ultimate
principles. Such were, as we have seen, the Principles of the
Conservation of <i>vis viva</i>, the Principle of the Conservation of
the Motion of the Centre of Gravity, and the like. These principles
may, of course, be deduced from our elementary laws, and were finally
established by mathematicians on that footing. There are other
principles which may be similarly demonstrated; among the rest, I may
mention the Principle of <i>the Conservation of areas</i>, which
extends to any number of bodies a law analogous to that which Kepler
had observed, and Newton demonstrated, respecting the areas described
by each planet round the sun. I may mention also, the Principle of the
<i>Immobility of the plane of maximum areas</i>, a plane which is not
disturbed by any mutual action of the parts of any system. The former
of these principles was published about the same time by Euler, D.
Bernoulli, and Darcy, under different forms, in 1746 and 1747; the
latter by Laplace.</p>
<p>To these may be added a law, very celebrated in its time, and the
occasion of an angry controversy, <i>the Principle of least
action</i>. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page381">381</a></span>
Maupertuis conceived that he could establish <i>à priori</i>, by
theological arguments, that all mechanical changes must take place in
the world so as to occasion the least possible quantity of
<em>action</em>. In asserting this, it was proposed to measure the
Action by the product of Velocity and Space; and this measure being
adopted, the mathematicians, though they did not generally assent to
Maupertuis’ reasonings, found that his principle expressed a
remarkable and useful truth, which might be established on known
mechanical grounds.</p>
<p>15. <i>Analytical Generality. Connection of Statics and
Dynamics.</i>&#8212;Before I quit this subject, it is important to
remark the peculiar character which the science of Mechanics has now
assumed, in consequence of the extreme analytical generality which has
been given it. Symbols, and operations upon symbols, include the whole
of the reasoner’s task; and though the relations of space are the
leading subjects in the science, the great analytical treatises upon
it do not contain a single diagram. The <i>Mécanique Analytique</i> of
Lagrange, of which the first edition appeared in 1788, is by far the
most consummate example of this analytical generality. “The plan of
this work,” says the author, “is entirely new. I have proposed to
myself to reduce the whole theory of this science, and the art of
resolving the problems which it includes, to general formulæ, of which
the simple development gives all the equations necessary for the
solution of the problem.”&#8212;“The reader will find no figures in
the work. The methods which I deliver do not require either
constructions, or geometrical or mechanical reasonings; but only
algebraical operations, subject to a regular and uniform rule of
proceeding.” Thus this writer makes Mechanics a branch of Analysis;
instead of making, as had previously been done, Analysis an implement
of Mechanics.<a id="fnanchor63-6" href="#note63-6"><span
class="fnanchor">63</span></a> The transcendent generalizing genius of
Lagrange, and his matchless analytical skill and elegance, have made
this undertaking as successful as it is striking.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note63-6"
href="#fnanchor63-6">63</a></span> Lagrange himself terms Mechanics,
“An Analytical Geometry of four dimensions.” Besides the <i>three
co-ordinates</i> which determine the place of a body in <i>space</i>,
the <i>time</i> enters as a <i>fourth co-ordinate</i>. [Note by
Littrow.]</div>
<p>The mathematical reader is aware that the language of mathematical
symbols is, in its nature, more general than the language of words:
and that in this way truths, translated into symbols, often suggest
their own generalizations. Something of this kind has happened in
Mechanics. The same Formula expresses the general condition of Statics
and that of Dynamics. The tendency to generalization which is thus
introduced by analysis, makes mathematicians unwilling to <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page382">382</a></span> acknowledge a
plurality of Mechanical principles; and in the most recent analytical
treatises on the subject, all the doctrines are deduced from the
single Law of Inertia. Indeed, if we identify Forces with the
Velocities which produce them, and allow the Composition of Forces to
be applicable to force <em>so understood</em>, it is easy to see that
we can reduce the Laws of Motion to the Principles of Statics; and
this conjunction, though it may not be considered as philosophically
just, is verbally correct. If we thus multiply or extend the meanings
of the term Force, we make our elementary principles simpler and fewer
than before; and those persons, therefore, who are willing to assent
to such a use of words, can thus obtain an additional generalisation
of dynamical principles; and this, as I have stated, has been adopted
in several recent treatises. I shall not further discuss here how far
this is a real advance in science.</p>
<p>Having thus rapidly gone through the history of Force and
Attraction in the abstract, we return to the attempt to interpret the
phenomena of the universe by the aid of these abstractions thus
established.</p>
<p>But before we do so, we may make one remark on the history of this
part of science. In consequence of the vast career into which the
Doctrine of Motion has been drawn by the splendid problems proposed to
it by Astronomy, the origin and starting-point of Mechanics, namely
Machines, had almost been lost out of sight. <em>Machines</em> had
become the smallest part of <em>Mechanics</em>, as
<em>Land-measuring</em> had become the smallest part of
<em>Geometry</em>. Yet the application of Mathematics to the doctrine
of Machines has led, at all periods of the Science, and especially in
our own time, to curious and valuable results. Some of these will be
noticed in the <a href="#v1page536"><i>Additions</i></a> to this volume.</p>

<span class="sc">Prelude to the Inductive Epoch of Newton.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">WE</span> have now to contemplate the
last and most splendid period of the progress of Astronomy;&#8212;the
grand completion of the history of the most ancient and prosperous
province of human knowledge;&#8212;the steps which elevated this
science to an unrivalled eminence above other sciences;&#8212;the
first great example of a wide and complex assemblage of phenomena
indubitably traced to their single simple cause;&#8212;in short, the
first example of the formation of a perfect Inductive Science.</p>
<p>In this, as in other considerable advances in real science, the
complete disclosure of the new truths by the principal discoverer, was
preceded by movements and glimpses, by trials, seekings, and guesses
on the part of others; by indications, in short, that men’s minds were
already carried by their intellectual impulses in the direction in
which the truth lay, and were beginning to detect its nature. In a
case so important and interesting as this, it is more peculiarly
proper to give some view of this Prelude to the Epoch of the full
discovery.</p>
<p>(<i>Francis Bacon.</i>) That Astronomy should become Physical
Astronomy,&#8212;that the motions of the heavenly bodies should be
traced to their causes, as well as reduced to rule,&#8212;was felt by
all persons of active and philosophical minds as a pressing and
irresistible need, at the time of which we speak. We have already seen
how much this feeling had to do in impelling Kepler to the train of
laborious research by which he made his discoveries. Perhaps it may be
interesting to point out how strongly this persuasion of the necessity
of giving a physical character to astronomy, had taken possession of
the mind of Bacon, who, looking at the progress of knowledge with a
more comprehensive spirit, and from a higher point of view than
Kepler, could have none of his astronomical prejudices, since on that
subject he was of a different school, and of far inferior knowledge.
In his “Description of the Intellectual Globe,” Bacon says that while
Astronomy had, up to that time, had it for her business to inquire
into the rules of the heavenly motions, and Philosophy into their
causes, they had both so far worked without due appreciation of their
respective tasks; Philosophy neglecting facts, and Astronomy claiming
assent to her <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page386">386</a></span>
mathematical hypotheses, which ought to be considered as mere steps of
calculation. “Since, therefore,” he continues,<a id="fnanchor1-7"
href="#note1-7"><span class="fnanchor">1</span></a> “each science has
hitherto been a slight and ill-constructed thing, we must assuredly
take a firmer stand; our ground being, that these two subjects, which
on account of the narrowness of men’s views and the traditions of
professors have been so long dissevered, are, in fact, one and the
same thing, and compose one body of science.” It must be allowed that,
however erroneous might be the points of Bacon’s positive astronomical
creed, these general views of the nature and position of the science
are most sound and philosophical.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-7"
href="#fnanchor1-7">1</a></span> Vol. ix. 221.</div>
<p id="kepler">(<i>Kepler</i>) In his attempts to suggest a right
physical view of the starry heavens and their relation to the earth,
Bacon failed, along with all the writers of his time. It has already
been stated that the main cause of this failure was the want of a
knowledge of the true theory of motion;&#8212;the non-existence of the
science of Dynamics. At the time of Bacon and Kepler, it was only just
beginning to be possible to reduce the heavenly motions to the laws of
earthly motion, because the latter were only just then divulged.
Accordingly, we have seen that the whole of Kepler’s physical
speculations proceed upon an ignorance of the first law of motion, and
assume it to be the main problem of the physical astronomer to assign
the cause which <em>keeps up</em> the motions of the planets. Kepler’s
doctrine is, that a certain Force or Virtue resides in the sun, by
which all bodies within his influence are carried round him. He
illustrates<a id="fnanchor2-7" href="#note2-7"><span
class="fnanchor">2</span></a> the nature of this Virtue in various
ways, comparing it to Light, and to the Magnetic Power, which it
resembles in the circumstances of operating at a distance, and also in
exercising a feebler influence as the distance becomes greater. But it
was obvious that these comparisons were very imperfect; for they do
not explain how the sun produces in a body at a distance a motion
<em>athwart</em> the line of emanation; and though Kepler introduced
an assumed rotation of the sun on his axis as the cause of this
effect, that such a cause could produce the result could not be
established by any analogy of terrestrial motions. But another image
to which he referred, suggested a much more substantial and
conceivable kind of mechanical action by which the celestial motions
might be produced, namely, a current of fluid matter circulating round
the sun, and carrying the planet with it, like a boat in a stream. In
the Table of Contents of the work on the planet Mars, the purport of
the chapter to which I have alluded is <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page387">387</a></span> stated as follows: “A physical
speculation, in which it is demonstrated that the vehicle of that
Virtue which urges the planets, circulates through the spaces of the
universe after the manner of a river or whirlpool (<i>vortex</i>),
moving quicker than the planets.” I think it will be found, by any one
who reads Kepler’s phrases concerning the <i>moving force,&#8212;the
magnetic nature,&#8212;the immaterial virtue</i> of the sun, that they
convey no distinct conception, except so far as they are interpreted
by the expressions just quoted. A vortex of fluid constantly whirling
round the sun, kept in this whirling motion by the rotation of the sun
himself, and carrying the planets round the sun by its revolution, as
a whirlpool carries straws, could be readily understood; and though it
appears to have been held by Kepler that this current and vortex was
immaterial, he ascribes to it the power of overcoming the inertia of
bodies, and of putting them and keeping them in motion, the only
material properties with which he had any thing to do. Kepler’s
physical reasonings, therefore, amount, in fact, to the doctrine of
Vortices round the central bodies, and are occasionally so stated by
himself; though by asserting these vortices to be “an immaterial
species,” and by the fickleness and variety of his phraseology on the
subject, he leaves this theory in some confusion;&#8212;a proceeding,
indeed, which both his want of sound mechanical conceptions, and his
busy and inventive fancy, might have led us to expect. Nor, we may
venture to say, was it easy for any one at Kepler’s time to devise a
more plausible theory than the theory of vortices might have been
made. It was only with the formation and progress of the science of
Mechanics that this theory became untenable.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note2-7"
href="#fnanchor2-7">2</a></span> <i>De Stellâ Martis</i>, P. 3. c.
xxxiv.</div>
<p>(<i>Descartes</i>) But if Kepler might be excused, or indeed
admired, for propounding the theory of Vortices at his time, the case
was different when the laws of motion had been fully developed, and
when those who knew the state of mechanical science ought to have
learned to consider the motions of the stars as a mechanical problem,
subject to the same conditions as other mechanical problems, and
capable of the same exactness of solution. And there was an especial
inconsistency in the circumstance of the Theory of Vortices being put
forwards by Descartes, who pretended, or was asserted by his admirers,
to have been one of the discoverers of the true Laws of Motion. It
certainly shows both great conceit and great shallowness, that he
should have proclaimed with much pomp this crude invention of the
ante-mechanical period, at the time when the best mathematicians of
Europe, as Borelli in Italy, Hooke and Wallis in England, Huyghens in
Holland, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page388">388</a></span> were
patiently laboring to bring the mechanical problem of the universe
into its most distinct form, in order that it might be solved at last
and forever.</p>
<p>I do not mean to assert that Descartes borrowed his doctrines from
Kepler, or from any of his predecessors, for the theory was
sufficiently obvious; and especially if we suppose the inventor to
seek his suggestions rather in the casual examples offered to the
sense than in the exact laws of motion. Nor would it be reasonable to
rob this philosopher of that credit, of the plausible deduction of a
vast system from apparently simple principles, which, at the time, was
so much admired; and which undoubtedly was the great cause of the many
converts to his views. At the same time we may venture to say that a
system of doctrine thus deduced from assumed principles by a long
chain of reasoning, and not verified and confirmed at every step by
detailed and exact facts, has hardly a chance of containing any truth.
Descartes said that he should think it little to show how the world
<em>is</em> constructed, if he could not also show that it
<em>must</em> of necessity have been so constructed. The more modest
philosophy which has survived the boastings of his school is content
to receive all its knowledge of facts from experience, and never
dreams of interposing its peremptory <em>must be</em> when nature is
ready to tell us what <em>is</em>. The <i>à priori</i> philosopher
has, however, always a strong feeling in his favor among men. The
deductive form of his speculations gives them something of the charm
and the apparent certainty of pure mathematics; and while he avoids
that laborious recurrence to experiments, and measures, and multiplied
observations, which is irksome and distasteful to those who are
impatient to grow wise at once, every fact of which the theory appears
to give an explanation, seems to be an unasked and almost an
infallible witness in its favor.</p>
<p>My business with Descartes here is only with his physical Theory of
Vortices; which, great as was its glory at one time, is now utterly
extinguished. It was propounded in his <i>Principia Philosophiæ</i>,
in 1644. In order to arrive at this theory, he begins, as might be
expected of him, from reasonings sufficiently general. He lays it down
as a maxim, in the first sentence of his book, that a person who seeks
for truth must, once in his life, doubt of all that he most believes.
Conceiving himself thus to have stripped himself of all his belief on
all subjects, in order to resume that part of it which merits to be
retained, he begins with his celebrated assertion, “I think, therefore
I am;” which appears to him a certain and immovable principle, by
means of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page389">389</a></span> which
he may proceed to something more. Accordingly, to this he soon adds
the idea, and hence the certain existence, of God and his perfections.
He then asserts it to be also manifest, that a vacuum in any part of
the universe is impossible; the whole must be filled with matter, and
the matter must be divided into equal angular parts, this being the
most simple, and therefore the most natural supposition.<a
id="fnanchor3-7" href="#note3-7"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a>
This matter being in motion, the parts are necessarily ground into a
spherical form; and the corners thus rubbed off (like filings or
sawdust) form a second and more subtle matter.<a id="fnanchor4-7"
href="#note4-7"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a> There is, besides,
a third kind of matter, of parts more coarse and less fitted for
motion. The first matter makes luminous bodies, as the sun, and the
fixed stars; the second is the transparent substance of the skies; the
third is the material of opake bodies, as the earth, planets, and
comets. We may suppose, also,<a id="fnanchor5-7" href="#note5-7"><span
class="fnanchor">5</span></a> that the motions of these parts take the
form of revolving circular currents,<a id="fnanchor6-7"
href="#note6-7"><span class="fnanchor">6</span></a> or
<i>vortices</i>. By this means, the first matter will be collected to
the centre of each vortex, while the second, or subtle matter,
surrounds it, and, by its centrifugal effort, constitutes light. The
planets are carried round the sun by the motion of his vortex,<a
id="fnanchor7-7" href="#note7-7"><span class="fnanchor">7</span></a>
each planet being at such a distance from the sun as to be in a part
of the vortex suitable to its solidity and mobility. The motions are
prevented from being exactly circular and regular by various causes;
for instance, a vortex may be pressed into an oval shape by contiguous
vortices. The satellites are, in like manner, carried round their
primary planets by subordinate vortices; while the comets have
sometimes the liberty of gliding out of one vortex into the one next
contiguous, and thus travelling in a sinuous course, from system to
system, through the universe. It is not necessary for us to speak here
of the entire deficiency of this system in mechanical consistency, and
in a correspondency to observation in details and measures. Its
general reception and temporary sway, in some instances even among
intelligent men and good mathematicians, are the most remarkable facts
connected with it. These may be ascribed, in part, to the circumstance
that philosophers were now ready and eager for a physical astronomy
commensurate with the existing state of knowledge; they may have been
owing also, in some measure, to the character and position of
Descartes. He was a man of high claims in every department of
speculation, and, in pure mathematics, a genuine inventor of great
eminence;&#8212;a man of family and a soldier;&#8212;an inoffensive
philosopher, attacked and persecuted <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page390">390</a></span> for his opinions with great bigotry and
fury by a Dutch divine, Voet;&#8212;the favorite and teacher of two
distinguished princesses, and, it is said, the lover of one of them.
This was Elizabeth, the daughter of the Elector Frederick, and
consequently grand-daughter of our James the First. His other royal
disciple, the celebrated Christiana of Sweden, showed her zeal for his
instructions by appointing the hour of five in the morning for their
interviews. This, in the climate of Sweden, and in the winter, was too
severe a trial for the constitution of the philosopher, born in the
sunny valley of the Loire; and, after a short residence at Stockholm,
he died of an inflammation of the chest in 1650. He always kept up an
active correspondence with his friend Mersenne, who was called, by
some of the Parisians, “the Resident of Descartes at Paris;” and who
informed him of all that was done in the world of science. It is said
that he at first sent to Mersenne an account of a system of the
universe which he had devised, which went on the assumption of a
vacuum; Mersenne informed him that the <em>vacuum</em> was no longer
the fashion at Paris; upon which he proceeded to remodel his system,
and to re-establish it on the principle of a <em>plenum</em>.
Undoubtedly he tried to avoid promulgating opinions which might bring
him into trouble. He, on all occasions, endeavored to explain away the
doctrine of the motion of the earth, so as to evade the scruples to
which the decrees of the pope had given rise; and, in stating the
theory of vortices, he says,<a id="fnanchor8-7" href="#note8-7"><span
class="fnanchor">8</span></a> “There is no doubt that the world was
created at first with all its perfection; nevertheless, it is well to
consider how it might have arisen from certain principles, although we
know that it did not.” Indeed, in the whole of his philosophy, he
appears to deserve the character of being both rash and cowardly,
“<i>pusillanimus simul et audax</i>,” far more than Aristotle, to
whose physical speculations Bacon applies this description.<a

<p>Whatever the causes might be, his system was well received and
rapidly adopted. Gassendi, indeed, says that he found nobody who had
the courage to read the <i>Principia</i> through;<a id="fnanchor10-7"
href="#note10-7"><span class="fnanchor">10</span></a> but the system
was soon embraced by the younger professors, who were eager to dispute
in its favor. It is said<a id="fnanchor11-7" href="#note11-7"><span
class="fnanchor">11</span></a> that the University of Paris was on the
point of publishing an edict against these new doctrines, and was only
prevented from doing so by a pasquinade which is worth mentioning. It
was composed by the poet Boileau (about 1684), and professed to be a
Request in favor of Aristotle, and an Edict issued from Mount <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page391">391</a></span> Parnassus in
consequence. It is obvious that, at this time, the cause of
Cartesianism was looked upon as the cause of free inquiry and modern
discovery, in opposition to that of bigotry, prejudice, and ignorance.
Probably the poet was far from being a very severe or profound critic
of the truth of such claims. “This petition of the Masters of Arts,
Professors and Regents of the University of Paris, humbly showeth,
that it is of public notoriety that the sublime and incomparable
Aristotle was, without contest, the first founder of the four
elements, fire, air, earth, and water; that he did, by special grace,
accord unto them a simplicity which belongeth not to them of natural
right;” and so on. “Nevertheless, since, a certain time past, two
individuals, named Reason and Experience, have leagued themselves
together to dispute his claim to the rank which of justice pertains to
him, and have tried to erect themselves a throne on the ruins of his
authority; and, in order the better to gain their ends, have excited
certain factious spirits, who, under the names of Cartesians and
Gassendists, have begun to shake off the yoke of their master,
Aristotle; and, contemning his authority, with unexampled temerity,
would dispute the right which he had acquired of making true pass for
false and false for true;”&#8212;In fact, this production does not
exhibit any of the peculiar tenets of Descartes, although, probably,
the positive points of his doctrines obtained a footing in the
University of Paris, under the cover of this assault on his
adversaries. The Physics of Rohault, a zealous disciple of Descartes,
was published at Paris about 1670,<a id="fnanchor12-7"
href="#note12-7"><span class="fnanchor">12</span></a> and was, for a
time, the standard book for students of this subject, both in France
and in England. I do not here speak of the later defenders of the
Cartesian system, for, in their hands, it was much modified by the
struggle which it had to maintain against the Newtonian system.</p>

<p>We are concerned with Descartes and his school only as they form
part of the picture of the intellectual condition of Europe just
before the publication of Newton’s discoveries. Beyond this, the
Cartesian speculations are without value. When, indeed, Descartes’
countrymen could no longer refuse their assent and admiration to the
Newtonian theory, it came to be the fashion among them to say that
Descartes had been the necessary precursor of Newton; and to adopt a
favorite saying of Leibnitz, that the Cartesian philosophy was the
antechamber of Truth. Yet this comparison is far from being happy: it
appeared rather as if these suitors had mistaken the door; for those
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page392">392</a></span> who first came
into the presence of Truth herself, were those who never entered this
imagined antechamber, and those who were in the antechamber first,
were the last in penetrating further. In partly the same spirit,
Playfair has noted it as a service which Newton perhaps owed to
Descartes, that “he had exhausted one of the most tempting forms of
error.” We shall see soon that this temptation had no attraction for
those who looked at the problem in its true light, as the Italian and
English philosophers already did. Voltaire has observed, far more
truly, that Newton’s edifice rested on no stone of Descartes’
foundations. He illustrates this by relating that Newton only once
read the work of Descartes, and, in doing so, wrote the word
“<em>error</em>,” repeatedly, on the first seven or eight pages; after
which he read no more. This volume, Voltaire adds, was for some time
in the possession of Newton’s nephew.<a id="fnanchor13-7"

<p>(<i>Gassendi.</i>) Even in his own country, the system of Descartes
was by no means universally adopted. We have seen that though Gassendi
was coupled with Descartes as one of the leaders of the new
philosophy, he was far from admiring his work. Gassendi’s own views of
the causes of the motions of the heavenly bodies are not very clear,
nor even very clearly referrible to the laws of mechanics; although he
was one of those who had most share in showing that those laws apply
to astronomical motions. In a chapter, headed<a id="fnanchor14-7"
href="#note14-7"><span class="fnanchor">14</span></a> “Quæ sit motrix
siderum causa,” he reviews several opinions; but the one which he
seems to adopt, is that which ascribes the motion of the celestial
globes to certain fibres, of which the action is similar to that of
the muscles of animals. It does not appear, therefore, that he had
distinctly apprehended, either the continuation of the movements of
the planets by the First Law of Motion, or their deflection by the
Second Law;&#8212;the two main steps on the road to the discovery of
the true forces by which they are made to describe their orbits.</p>

<p>(<i>Leibnitz, &amp;c.</i>) Nor does it appear that in Germany
mathematicians had attained this point of view. Leibnitz, as we have
seen, did not assent to the opinions of Descartes, as containing the
complete truth; and yet his own views of the physics of the universe
do not seem to have any great advantage over these. In 1671 he
published <i>A new physical hypothesis, by which the causes of most
phenomena are deduced from a certain single universal motion supposed
in our globe;&#8212;not to be despised either by the Tychonians or the
Copernicans</i>. He supposes <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page393">393</a></span> the particles of the earth to have
separate motions, which produce collisions, and thus propagate<a
id="fnanchor15-7" href="#note15-7"><span
class="fnanchor">15</span></a> an “agitation of the ether,” radiating
in all directions; and,<a id="fnanchor16-7" href="#note16-7"><span
class="fnanchor">16</span></a> “by the rotation of the sun on its
axis, concurring with its rectilinear action on the earth, arises the
motion of the earth about the sun.” The other motions of the solar
system are, as we might expect, accounted for in a similar manner; but
it appears difficult to invest such an hypothesis with any mechanical
consistency.</p>

<p>John Bernoulli maintained to the last the Cartesian hypothesis,
though with several modifications of his own, and even pretended to
apply mathematical calculation to his principles. This, however,
belongs to a later period of our history; to the reception, not to the
prelude, of the Newtonian theory.</p>
<p id="borelli">(<i>Borelli.</i>) In Italy, Holland, and England,
mathematicians appear to have looked much more steadily at the problem
of the celestial motions, by the light which the discovery of the real
laws of motion threw upon it. In Borelli’s <i>Theories of the Medicean
Planets</i>, printed at Florence in 1666, we have already a conception
of the nature of central action, in which true notions begin to
appear. The attraction of a body upon another which revolves about it
is spoken of and likened to magnetic action; not converting the
attracting force into a transverse force, according to the erroneous
views of Kepler, but taking it as a tendency of the bodies to meet.
“It is manifest,” says he,<a id="fnanchor17-7" href="#note17-7"><span
class="fnanchor">17</span></a> “that every planet and satellite
revolves round some principal globe of the universe as a fountain of
virtue, which so draws and holds them that they cannot by any means be
separated from it, but are compelled to follow it wherever it goes, in
constant and continuous revolutions.” And, further on, he describes<a
id="fnanchor18-7" href="#note18-7"><span
class="fnanchor">18</span></a> the nature of the action, as a matter
of conjecture indeed, but with remarkable correctness.<a
id="fnanchor19-7" href="#note19-7"><span
class="fnanchor">19</span></a> “We shall account for these motions by
supposing, that which can hardly be denied, that the planets have a
certain natural appetite for uniting themselves with the globe round
which they revolve, and that they really tend, with all their efforts,
to approach to such globe; the planets, for instance, to the sun, the
Medicean Stars to Jupiter. It is certain, also, that circular motion
gives a body a tendency to recede from the centre of such revolution,
as we find in a wheel, or a stone whirled in a sling. Let us suppose,
then, the planet to endeavor to approach the sun; since, in the mean
time, it requires, by the circular motion, a force to recede from the
same central body, it comes to pass, that when <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page394">394</a></span> those two opposite
forces are equal, each compensates the other, and the planet cannot go
nearer to the sun nor further from him than a certain determinate
space, and thus appears balanced and floating about him.”</p>

<p>This is a very remarkable passage; but it will be observed, at the
same time, that the author has no distinct conception of the manner in
which the change of direction of the planet’s motion is regulated from
one instant to another; still less do his views lead to any mode of
calculating the distance from the central body at which the planet
would be thus balanced, or the space through which it might approach
to the centre and recede from it. There is a great interval from
Borelli’s guesses, even to Huyghens’ theorems  and a much greater to
the beginning of Newton’s discoveries.</p>
<p>(<i>England.</i>) It is peculiarly interesting to us to trace the
gradual approach towards these discoveries which took place in the
minds of English mathematicians  and this we can do with tolerable
distinctness. Gilbert, in his work, <i>De Magnete</i>, printed in
1600, has only some vague notions that the magnetic virtue of the
earth in some way determines the direction of the earth’s axis, the
rate of its diurnal rotation, and that of the revolution of the moon
about it.<a id="fnanchor20-7" href="#note20-7"><span
class="fnanchor">20</span></a> He died in 1603, and, in his posthumous
work, already <a href="#v1page275">mentioned</a> (<i>De Mundo nostro
Sublunari Philosophia nova</i>, 1651), we have already a more distinct
statement of the attraction of one body by another.<a
id="fnanchor21-7" href="#note21-7"><span
class="fnanchor">21</span></a> “The force which emanates from the moon
reaches to the earth, and, in like manner, the magnetic virtue of the
earth pervades the region of the moon: both correspond and conspire by
the joint action of both, according to a proportion and conformity of
motions; but the earth has more effect, in consequence of its superior
mass; the earth attracts and repels the moon, and the moon, within
certain limits, the earth; not so as to make the bodies come together,
as magnetic bodies do, but so that they may go on in a continuous
course.” Though this phraseology is capable of representing a good
deal of the truth, it does not appear to have been connected, in the
author’s mind, with any very definite notions of mechanical action in
detail. We may probably say the same of Milton’s language:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page395">395</a></span> Boyle, about
the same period, seems to have inclined to the Cartesian hypothesis.
Thus, in order to show the advantage of the natural theology which
contemplates organic contrivances, over that which refers to
astronomy, he remarks: “It may be said, that in bodies inanimate,<a
id="fnanchor22-7" href="#note22-7"><span
class="fnanchor">22</span></a> the contrivance is very rarely so
exquisite but that the various motions and occurrences of their parts
may, without much improbability, be suspected capable, after many
essays, to cast one another into several of those circumvolutions
called by Epicurus συστροφὰς and by Descartes, <i>vortices</i>; which
being once made, may continue a long time after the manner explained
by the latter.” Neither Milton nor Boyle, however, can be supposed to
have had an exact knowledge of the laws of mechanics; and therefore
they do not fully represent the views of their mathematical
contemporaries. But there arose about this time a group of
philosophers, who began to knock at the door where Truth was to be
found, although it was left for Newton to force it open. These were
the founders of the Royal Society, Wilkins, Wallis, Seth Ward, Wren,
Hooke, and others. The time of the beginning of the speculations and
association of these men corresponds to the time of the civil wars
between the king and parliament in England  and it does not appear a
fanciful account of their scientific zeal and activity, to say, that
while they shared the common mental ferment of the times, they sought
in the calm and peaceful pursuit of knowledge a contrast to the
vexatious and angry struggles which at that time disturbed the repose
of society. It was well if these dissensions produced any good to
science to balance the obvious evils which flowed from them.
Gascoigne, the inventor of the micrometer, a friend of Horrox, was
killed in the battle of Marston Moor. Milburne, another friend of
Horrox, who like him detected the errors of Lansberg’s astronomical
tables, left papers on this subject, which were lost by the coming of
the Scotch army into England in 1639; in the civil war which ensued,
the anatomical collections of Harvey were plundered and destroyed.
Most of these persons of whom I have lately had to speak, were
involved in the changes of fortune of the Commonwealth, some on one
side, and some on the other. Wilkins was made Warden of Wadham by the
committee of parliament appointed for reforming the University of
Oxford; and was, in 1659, made Master of Trinity College, Cambridge,
by Richard Cromwell, but ejected thence the year following, upon the
restoration of the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page396">396</a></span> royal sway. Seth Ward, who was a Fellow
of Sidney College, Cambridge, was deprived of his Fellowship by the
parliamentary committee; but at a later period (1649) he took the
engagement to be faithful to the Commonwealth, and became Savilian
Professor of Astronomy at Oxford. Wallis held a Fellowship of Queen’s
College, Cambridge, but vacated it by marriage. He was afterwards much
employed by the royal party in deciphering secret writings, in which
art he had peculiar skill. Yet he was appointed by the parliamentary
commissioners Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford, in which
situation he was continued by Charles II. after his restoration.
Christopher Wren was somewhat later, and escaped these changes. He was
chosen Fellow of All-Souls in 1652, and succeeded Ward as Savilian
Professor of Astronomy. These men, along with Boyle and several
others, formed themselves into a club, which they called the
Philosophical, or the Invisible College; and met, from about the year
1645, sometimes in London, and sometimes in Oxford, according to the
changes of fortune and residence of the members. Hooke went to Christ
Church, Oxford, in 1663, where he was patronized by Boyle, Ward, and
Wallis; and when the Philosophical College resumed its meetings in
London, after the Restoration, as the Royal Society, Hooke was made
“curator of experiments.” Halley was of the next generation, and comes
after Newton; he studied at Queen’s College, Oxford, in 1673; but was
at first a man of some fortune, and not engaged in any official
situation. His talents and zeal, however, made him an active and
effective ally in the promotion of science.</p>

<p>The connection of the persons of whom we have been speaking has a
bearing on our subject, for it led, historically speaking, to the
publication of Newton’s discoveries in physical astronomy. Rightly to
propose a problem is no inconsiderable step to its solution; and it
was undoubtedly a great advance towards the true theory of the
universe to consider the motion of the planets round the sun as a
mechanical question, to be solved by a reference to the laws of
motion, and by the use of mathematics. So far the English philosophers
appear to have gone, before the time of Newton. Hooke, indeed, when
the doctrine of gravitation was published, asserted that he had
discovered it previously to Newton; and though this pretension could
not be maintained, he certainly had perceived that the thing to be
done was, to determine the effect of a central force in producing
curvilinear motion; which effect, as we have <a
href="#v1page354">already</a> seen, he illustrated by experiment as
early as 1666. Hooke had also spoken more clearly on this subject
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page397">397</a></span> in <i>An
Attempt to prove the Motion of the Earth from Observations</i>,
published in 1674. In this, he distinctly states that the planets
would move in straight lines, if they were not deflected by central
forces; and that the central attractive power increases in approaching
the centre in certain degrees, dependent on the distance. “Now what
these degrees are,” he adds, “I have not yet experimentally verified;”
but he ventures to promise to any one who succeeds in this
undertaking, a discovery of the cause of the heavenly motions. He
asserted, in conversation, to Halley and Wren, that he had solved this
problem, but his solution was never produced. The proposition that the
attractive force of the sun varies inversely as the square of the
distance from the centre, had already been divined, if not fully
established. If the orbits of the planets were circles, this
proportion of the forces might be deduced in the same manner as the
propositions concerning circular motion, which Huyghens published in
1673; yet it does not appear that Huyghens made this application of
his principles. Newton, however, had already made this step some years
before this time. Accordingly, he says in a letter to Halley, on
Hooke’s claim to this discovery,<a id="fnanchor23-7"
href="#note23-7"><span class="fnanchor">23</span></a> “When Huygenius
put out his <i>Horologium Oscillatorium</i>, a copy being presented to
me, in my letter of thanks I gave those rules in the end thereof a
particular commendation for their usefulness in computing the forces
of the moon from the earth, and the earth from the sun.” He says,
moreover, “I am almost confident by circumstances, that Sir
Christopher Wren knew the duplicate proportion when I gave him a
visit; and then Mr. Hooke, by his book <i>Cometa</i>, will prove the
last of us three that knew it.” Hooke’s <i>Cometa</i> was published in
1678. These inferences were all connected with Kepler’s law, that the
times are in the sesquiplicate ratio of the major axes of the orbits.
But Halley had also been led to the duplicate proportion by another
train of reasoning, namely, by considering the force of the sun as an
emanation, which must become more feeble in proportion to the
increased spherical surface over which it is diffused, and therefore
in the inverse proportion of the square of the distances.<a
id="fnanchor24-7" href="#note24-7"><span
class="fnanchor">24</span></a> In this view of the matter, however,
the difficulty was to determine what would be the motion of a body
acted on by such a force, when the orbit is not circular but oblong.
The investigation of this case was a problem which, we can <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page398">398</a></span> easily conceive, must
have appeared of very formidable complexity while it was unsolved, and
the first of its kind. Accordingly Halley, as his biographer says,
“finding himself unable to make it out in any geometrical way, first
applied to Mr. Hooke and Sir Christopher Wren, and meeting with no
assistance from either of them, he went to Cambridge in August (1684),
to Mr. Newton, who supplied him fully with what he had so ardently
sought.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note23-7"

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note24-7"
href="#fnanchor24-7">24</a></span> Bullialdus, in 1645, had asserted
that the force by which the sun “prehendit et harpagat,” takes hold of
and grapples the planets, must be as the inverse square of the
distance.</div>
<p>A paper of Halley’s in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> for
January, 1686, professedly inserted as a preparation for Newton’s
work, contains some arguments against the Cartesian hypothesis of
gravity, which seem to imply that Cartesian opinions had some footing
among English philosophers; and we are told by Whiston, Newton’s
successor in his professorship at Cambridge, that Cartesianism formed
a part of the studies of that place. Indeed, Rohault’s <i>Physics</i>
was used as a classbook at that University long after the time of
which we are speaking; but the peculiar Cartesian doctrines which it
contained were soon superseded by others.</p>
<p>With regard, then, to this part of the discovery, that the force of
the sun follows the inverse duplicate proportion of the distances, we
see that several other persons were on the verge of it at the same
time with Newton; though he alone possessed that combination of
distinctness of thought and power of mathematical invention, which
enabled him to force his way across the barrier. But another, and so
far as we know, an earlier train of thought, led by a different path
to the same result; and it was the convergence of these two lines of
reasoning that brought the conclusion to men’s minds with irresistible
force. I speak now of the identification of the force which retains
the moon in her orbit with the force of gravity by which bodies fall
at the earth’s surface. In this comparison Newton had, so far as I am
aware, no forerunner. We are now, therefore, arrived at the point at
which the history of Newton’s great discovery properly begins. ~Additional

Universal Gravitation of Matter, according to the Law of the Inverse
Square of the Distance.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IN</span> order that we may the more
clearly consider the bearing of this, the greatest scientific
discovery ever made, we shall resolve it into the partial propositions
of which it consists. Of these we may enumerate five. The doctrine of
universal gravitation asserts,</p>
<p>1. That the force by which the <em>different</em> planets are
attracted to the sun is in the inverse proportion of the squares of
their distances;</p>
<p>2. That the force by which the <em>same</em> planet is attracted to
the sun, in different parts of its orbit, is also in the inverse
proportion of the squares of the distances;</p>
<p>3. That the <em>earth</em> also exerts such a force on the
<em>moon</em>, and that this force is identical with the force of
<em>gravity</em>;</p>
<p>4. That bodies thus act on <em>other</em> bodies, besides those
which revolve round them; thus, that the sun exerts such a force on
the moon and satellites, and that the planets exert such forces on
<em>one another</em>;</p>
<p>5. That this force, thus exerted by the general masses of the sun,
earth, and planets, arises from the attraction of <em>each
particle</em> of these masses; which attraction follows the above law,
and belongs to all matter alike.</p>
<p>The history of the establishment of these five truths will be given
in order.</p>
<p>1. <i>Sun’s Force on Different Planets.</i>&#8212;With regard to
the first of the above five propositions, that the different planets
are attracted to the sun by a force which is inversely as the square
of the distance, Newton had so far been anticipated, that several
persons had discovered it to be true, or nearly true; that is, they
had discovered that if the orbits of the planets were circles, the
proportions of the central force to the inverse square of the distance
would follow from Kepler’s third law, of the sesquiplicate proportion
of the periodic times. As we have seen, Huyghens’ theorems would have
proved this, if they had been so applied; Wren knew it; Hooke not only
knew it, but claimed a prior knowledge to Newton; and Halley had
satisfied himself that it was at <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page400">400</a></span> least nearly true, before he visited
Newton. Hooke was reported to Newton at Cambridge, as having applied
to the Royal Society to do him justice with regard to his claims; but
when Halley wrote and informed Newton (in a letter dated June 29,
1686), that Hooke’s conduct “had been represented in worse colors than
it ought,” Newton inserted in his book a notice of these his
predecessors, in order, as he said, “to compose the dispute.”<a
id="fnanchor25-7" href="#note25-7"><span
class="fnanchor">25</span></a> This notice appears in a Scholium to
the fourth Proposition of the <i>Principia</i>, which states the
general law of revolutions in circles. “The case of the sixth
corollary,” Newton there says, “obtains in the celestial bodies, as
has been separately inferred by our countrymen, Wren, Hooke, and
Halley;” he soon after names Huyghens, “who, in his excellent treatise
<i>De Horologio Oscillatorio</i>, compares the force of gravity with
the centrifugal forces of revolving bodies.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note25-7"
href="#fnanchor25-7">25</a></span> <i>Biog. Brit.</i> folio, art.
<i>Hooke.</i></div>
<p>The two steps requisite for this discovery were, to propose the
motions of the planets as simply a mechanical problem, and to apply
mathematical reasoning so as to solve this problem, with reference to
Kepler’s third law considered as a fact. The former step was a
consequence of the mechanical discoveries of Galileo and his school;
the result of the firm and clear place which these gradually obtained
in men’s mind, and of the utter abolition of all the notions of solid
spheres by Kepler. The mathematical step required no small
mathematical powers; as appears, when we consider that this was the
first example of such a problem, and that the method of limits, under
all its forms, was at this time in its infancy, or rather, at its
birth. Accordingly, even this step, though much the easiest in the
path of deduction, no one before Newton completely executed.</p>
<p>2. <i>Force in different Points of an Orbit.</i>&#8212;The
inference of the law of the force from Kepler’s two laws concerning
the elliptical motion, was a problem quite different from the
preceding, and much more difficult; but the dispute with respect to
priority in the two propositions was intermingled. Borelli, in 1666,
had, as we have <a href="#borelli">seen</a>, endeavored to reconcile
the general form of the orbit with the notion of a central attractive
force, by taking centrifugal force into the account; and Hooke, in
1679, had asserted that the result of the law of the inverse square in
the force of the earth would be an ellipse,<a id="fnanchor26-7"
href="#note26-7"><span class="fnanchor">26</span></a> or a curve like
an ellipse.<a id="fnanchor27-7" href="#note27-7"><span
class="fnanchor">27</span></a> But it does not appear that this was
any thing more than <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page401">401</a></span> a conjecture. Halley says<a
id="fnanchor28-7" href="#note28-7"><span
class="fnanchor">28</span></a> that “Hooke, in 1683, told him he had
demonstrated all the laws of the celestial motions by the reciprocally
duplicate proportion of the force of gravity; but that, being offered
forty shillings by Sir Christopher Wren to produce such a
demonstration, his answer was, that he had it, but would conceal it
for some time, that others, trying and failing, might know how to
value it when he should make it public.” Halley, however, truly
observes, that after the publication of the demonstration in the
<i>Principia</i>, this reason no longer held; and adds, “I have
plainly told him, that unless he produce another differing
demonstration, and let the world judge of it, neither I nor any one
else can believe it.”</p>

<p>Newton allows that Hooke’s assertions in 1679 gave occasion to his
investigation on this point of the theory. His demonstration is
contained in the second and third Sections of the <i>Principia</i>. He
first treats of the general law of central forces in any curve; and
then, on account, as he states, of the application to the motion of
the heavenly bodies, he treats of the case of force varying inversely
as the square of the distance, in a more diffuse manner.</p>
<p>In this, as in the former portion of his discovery, the two steps
were, the proposing the heavenly motions as a mechanical problem, and
the solving this problem. Borelli and Hooke had certainly made the
former step, with considerable distinctness; but the mathematical
solution required no common inventive power.</p>
<p>Newton seems to have been much ruffled by Hooke’s speaking slightly
of the value of this second step; and is moved in return to deny
Hooke’s pretensions with some asperity, and to assert his own. He
says, in a letter to Halley, “Borelli did something in it, and wrote
modestly; he (Hooke) has done nothing; and yet written in such a way
as if he knew, and had sufficiently hinted all but what remained to be
determined by the drudgery of calculations and observations; excusing
himself from that labor by reason of his other business; whereas he
should rather have excused himself by reason of his inability; for it
is very plain, by his words, he knew not how to go about it. Now is
not this very fine? Mathematicians that find out, settle, and do all
the business, must content themselves with being nothing but dry
calculators and drudges; and another that does nothing but pretend and
grasp at all things, must carry away all the inventions, as well of
those that were to follow him as of those that <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page402">402</a></span> went before.” This
was written, however, under the influence of some degree of mistake;
and in a subsequent letter, Newton says, “Now I understand he was in
some respects misrepresented to me, I wish I had spared the postscript
to my last,” in which is the passage just quoted. We see, by the
melting away of rival claims, the undivided honor which belongs to
Newton, as the real discoverer of the proposition now under notice. We
may add, that in the sequel of the third Section of the
<i>Principia</i>, he has traced its consequences, and solved various
problems flowing from it with his usual fertility and beauty of
mathematical resource; and has there shown the necessary connection of
Kepler’s third law with his first and second.</p>
<p>3. <i>Moon’s Gravity to the Earth.</i>&#8212;Though others had
considered cosmical forces as governed by the general laws of motion,
it does not appear that they had identified such forces with the force
of terrestrial gravity. This step in Newton’s discoveries has
generally been the most spoken of by superficial thinkers; and a false
kind of interest has been attached to it, from the story of its being
suggested by the fall of an apple. The popular mind is caught by the
character of an eventful narrative which the anecdote gives to this
occurrence; and by the antithesis which makes a profound theory appear
the result of a trivial accident. How inappropriate is such a view of
the matter we shall soon see. The narrative of the progress of
Newton’s thoughts, is given by Pemberton (who had it from Newton
himself) in his preface to his <i>View of Newton’s Philosophy</i>, and
by Voltaire, who had it from Mrs. Conduit, Newton’s niece.<a
id="fnanchor29-7" href="#note29-7"><span
class="fnanchor">29</span></a> “The first thoughts,” we are told,
“which gave rise to his <i>Principia</i>, he had when he retired from
Cambridge, in 1666, on account of the plague (he was then twenty-four
years of age). As he sat alone in a garden, he fell into a speculation
on the power of gravity; that as this power is not found sensibly
diminished at the remotest distance from the centre of the earth to
which we can rise, neither at the tops of the loftiest buildings, nor
even on the summits of the highest mountains, it appeared to him
reasonable to conclude that this power must extend much further than
was usually thought: Why not as high as the moon? said he to himself;
and if so, her motion must be influenced by it; perhaps she is
retained in her orbit thereby.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note29-7"
href="#fnanchor29-7">29</a></span> <i>Elémens de Phil. de Newton</i>,
3me partie, chap. iii.</div>
<p>The thought of cosmical gravitation was thus distinctly brought
into being; and Newton’s superiority here was, that he conceived the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page403">403</a></span> celestial
motions as distinctly as the motions which took place close to
him;&#8212;considered them as of the same kind, and applied the same
rules to each, without hesitation or obscurity. But so far, this
thought was merely a guess: its occurrence showed the activity of the
thinker; but to give it any value, it required much more than a “why
not?”&#8212;a “perhaps.” Accordingly, Newton’s “why not?” was
immediately succeeded by his “if so, what then?” His reasoning was,
that if gravity reach to the moon, it is probably of the same kind as
the central force of the sun, and follows the same rule with respect
to the distance. What is this rule? We have already seen that, by
calculating from Kepler’s laws, and supposing the orbits to be
circles, the rule of the force appears to be the inverse duplicate
proportion of the distance; and this, which had been current as a
conjecture among the previous generation of mathematicians, Newton had
already proved by indisputable reasonings, and was thus prepared to
proceed in his train of inquiry. If, then, he went on, pursuing his
train of thought, the earth’s gravity extend to the moon, diminishing
according to the inverse square of the distance, will it, at the
moon’s orbit, be of the proper magnitude for retaining her in her
path? Here again came in calculation, and a calculation of extreme
interest; for how important and how critical was the decision which
depended on the resulting numbers? According to Newton’s calculations,
made at this time, the moon by her motion in her orbit, was deflected
from the tangent every minute through a space of thirteen feet. But by
noticing the space through which bodies would fall in one minute at
the earth’s surface, and supposing this to be diminished in the ratio
of the inverse square, it appeared that gravity would, at the moon’s
orbit, draw a body through more than fifteen feet. The difference
seems small, the approximation encouraging, the theory plausible; a
man in love with his own fancies would readily have discovered or
invented some probable cause of this difference. But Newton acquiesced
in it as a disproof of his conjecture, and “laid aside at that time
any further thoughts of this matter;<span class="correction"
title="omitted in text">”</span> thus resigning a favorite hypothesis,
with a candor and openness to conviction not inferior to Kepler,
though his notion had been taken up on far stronger and sounder
grounds than Kepler dealt in; and without even, so far as we know,
Kepler’s regrets and struggles. Nor was this levity or indifference;
the idea, though thus laid aside, was not finally condemned and
abandoned. When Hooke, in 1679, contradicted Newton on the subject of
the curve described by a falling body, and asserted it to be an
ellipse, Newton <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page404">404</a></span>
was led to investigate the subject, and was then again conducted, by
another road, to the same law of the inverse square of the distance.
This naturally turned his thoughts to his former speculations. Was
there really no way of explaining the discrepancy which this law gave,
when he attempted to reduce the moon’s motion to the action of
gravity? A scientific operation then recently completed, gave the
explanation at once. He had been mistaken in the magnitude of the
earth, and consequently in the distance of the moon, which is
determined by measurements of which the earth’s radius is the base. He
had taken the common estimate, current among geographers and seamen,
that sixty English miles are contained in one degree of latitude. But
Picard, in 1670, had measured the length of a certain portion of the
meridian in France, with far greater accuracy than had yet been
attained  and this measure enabled Newton to repeat his calculations
with these amended data. We may imagine the strong curiosity which he
must have felt as to the result of these calculations. His former
conjecture was now found to agree with the phenomena to a remarkable
degree of precision. This conclusion, thus coming after long doubts
and delays, and falling in with the other results of mechanical
calculation for the solar system, gave a stamp from that moment to his
opinions, and through him to those of the whole philosophical
world.</p>
<p>[2d Ed.] [Dr. Robison (<i>Mechanical Philosophy</i>, p. 288) says
that Newton having become a member of the Royal Society, there learned
the accurate measurement of the earth by Picard, differing very much
from the estimation by which he had made his calculations in 1666. And
M. Biot, in his Life of Newton, published in the <i>Biographie
Universelle</i>, says, “According to conjecture, about the month of
June, 1682, Newton being in London at a meeting of the Royal Society,
mention was made of the new measure of a degree of the earth’s
surface, recently executed in France by Picard; and great praise was
given to the care which had been employed in making this measure
exact.”</p>
<p>I had adopted this conjecture as a fact in my first edition; but it
has been pointed out by Prof. Rigaud (<i>Historical Essay on the First
Publication of the Principia</i>, 1838), that Picard’s measurement was
probably well known to the Fellows of the Royal Society as early as
1675, there being an account of the results of it given in the
<i>Philosophical Transactions</i> for that year. Newton appears to
have discovered the method of determining that a body might describe
an ellipse when acted upon by a force residing in the focus, and
varying <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page405">405</a></span>
inversely as the square of the distance, in 1679, upon occasion of his
correspondence with Hooke. In 1684, at Halley’s request, he returned
to the subject, and in February, 1685, there was inserted in the
Register of the Royal Society a paper of Newton’s (<i>Isaaci Newtoni
Propositiones de Motu</i>) which contained some of the principal
Propositions of the first two Books of the <i>Principia</i>. This
paper, however, does not contain the Proposition “Lunam gravitare in
terram,” nor any of the other propositions of the third Book. The
<i>Principia</i> was printed in 1686 and 7, apparently at the expense
of Halley. On the 6th of April, 1687, the third Book was presented to
the Royal Society.]</p>
<p>It does not appear, I think, that before Newton, philosophers in
general had supposed that terrestrial gravity was the very force by
which the moon’s motions are produced. Men had, as we have seen, taken
up the conception of such forces, and had probably called them
gravity: but this was done only to explain, by analogy, what
<em>kind</em> of forces they were, just as at other times they
compared them with magnetism; and it did not imply that terrestrial
gravity was a force which acted in the celestial spaces. After Newton
had discovered that this was so, the application of the term “gravity”
did undoubtedly convey such a suggestion; but we should err if we
inferred from this coincidence of expression that the notion was
commonly entertained before him. Thus Huyghens appears to use language
which may be mistaken, when he says,<a id="fnanchor30-7"
href="#note30-7"><span class="fnanchor">30</span></a> that Borelli was
of opinion that the primary planets were urged by “gravity” towards
the sun, and the satellites towards the primaries. The notion of
terrestrial gravity, as being actually a cosmical force, is foreign to
all Borelli’s speculations.<a id="fnanchor31-7" href="#note31-7"><span
class="fnanchor">31</span></a> But Horrox, as early as 1635, appears
to have entertained the true view on this subject, although vitiated
by Keplerian errors concerning the connection between the rotation of
the central body and its effect on the body which revolves about it.
Thus he says,<a id="fnanchor32-7" href="#note32-7"><span
class="fnanchor">32</span></a> that the emanation of the earth carries
a projected stone along with the motion of the earth, just in the same
way as it carries the moon in her orbit; and that this force is
greater on the stone than on the moon, because the distance is
less.</p>

<p>The Proposition in which Newton has stated the discovery of which
we are now speaking, is the fourth of his third Book: “That the moon
gravitates to the earth, and by the force of gravity is perpetually
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page406">406</a></span> deflected from
a rectilinear motion, and retained in her orbit.” The proof consists
in the numerical calculation, of which he only gives the elements, and
points out the method; but we may observe, that no small degree of
knowledge of the way in which astronomers had obtained these elements,
and judgment in selecting among them, were necessary: thus, the mean
distance of the moon had been made as little as fifty-six and a half
semidiameters of the earth by Tycho, and as much as sixty-two and a
half by Kircher: Newton gives good reasons for adopting sixty-one.</p>
<p>The term “gravity,” and the expression “to gravitate,” which, as we
have just seen, Newton uses of the moon, were to receive a still wider
application in consequence of his discoveries; but in order to make
this extension clearer, we consider it as a separate step.

<p>4. <i>Mutual Attraction of all the Celestial Bodies.</i>&#8212;If
the preceding parts of the discovery of gravitation were comparatively
easy to conjecture, and difficult to prove, this was much more the
case with the part of which we have now to speak, the attraction of
other bodies, besides the central ones, upon the planets and
satellites. If the mathematical calculation of the unmixed effect of a
central force required transcendent talents, how much must the
difficulty be increased, when other influences prevented those first
results from being accurately verified, while the deviations from
accuracy were far more complex than the original action! If it had not
been that these deviations, though surprisingly numerous and
complicated in their nature, were very small in their quantity, it
would have been impossible for the intellect of man to deal with the
subject; as it was, the struggle with its difficulties is even now a
matter of wonder.</p>
<p>The conjecture that there is some mutual action of the planets, had
been put forth by Hooke in his <i>Attempt to prove the Motion of the
Earth</i> (1674). It followed, he said, from his doctrine, that not
only the sun and moon act upon the course and motion of the earth, but
that Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, have also, by their
attractive power, a considerable influence upon the motion of the
earth, and the earth in like manner powerfully affects the motions of
those bodies. And Borelli, in attempting to form “theories” of the
satellites of Jupiter, had seen, though dimly and confusedly, the
probability that the sun would disturb the motions of these bodies.
Thus he says (cap. 14), “How can we believe that the Medicean globes
are not, like other planets, impelled with a greater velocity when
they approach the sun: and thus they are acted upon by two moving
forces, one of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page407">407</a></span>
which produces their proper revolution about Jupiter, the other
regulates their motion round the sun.” And in another place (cap. 20),
he attempts to show an effect of this principle upon the inclination
of the orbit; though, as might be expected, without any real
result.</p>
<p>The case which most obviously suggests the notion that the sun
exerts a power to disturb the motions of secondary planets about
primary ones, might seem to be our own moon; for the great
inequalities which had hitherto been discovered, had all, except the
first, or elliptical anomaly, a reference to the position of the sun.
Nevertheless, I do not know that any one had attempted thus to explain
the curiously irregular course of the earth’s attendant. To calculate,
from the disturbing agency, the amount of the irregularities, was a
problem which could not, at any former period, have been dreamt of as
likely to be at any time within the verge of human power.</p>
<p>Newton both made the step of inferring that there were such forces,
and, to a very great extent, calculated the effects of them. The
inference is made on mechanical principles, in the sixth Theorem of
the third Book of the <i>Principia</i>;&#8212;that the moon is
attracted by the sun, as the earth is;&#8212;that the satellites of
Jupiter and Saturn are attracted as the primaries are; in the same
manner, and with the same forces. If this were not so, it is shown
that these attendant bodies could not accompany the principal ones in
the regular manner in which they do. All those bodies at equal
distances from the sun would be equally attracted.</p>
<p>But the complexity which must occur in tracing the results of this
principle will easily be seen. The satellite and the primary, though
nearly at the same distance, and in the same direction, from the sun,
are not exactly so. Moreover the difference of the distances and of
the directions is perpetually changing; and if the motion of the
satellite be elliptical, the cycle of change is long and intricate: on
this account alone the effects of the sun’s action will inevitably
follow cycles as long and as perplexed as those of the positions. But
on another account they will be still more complicated; for in the
continued action of a force, the effect which takes place at first,
modifies and alters the effect afterwards. The result at any moment is
the sum of the results in preceding instants: and since the terms, in
this series of instantaneous effects, follow very complex rules, the
sums of such series will be, it might be expected, utterly incapable
of being reduced to any manageable degree of simplicity.</p>
<p>It certainly does not appear that any one but Newton could make
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page408">408</a></span> any impression
on this problem, or course of problems. No one for sixty years after
the publication of the <i>Principia</i>, and, with Newton’s methods,
no one up to the present day, had added any thing of any value to his
deductions. We know that he calculated all the principal lunar
inequalities; in many of the cases, he has given us his processes; in
others, only his results. But who has presented, in his beautiful
geometry, or deduced from his simple principles, any of the
inequalities which he left untouched? The ponderous instrument of
synthesis, so effective in his hands, has never since been grasped by
one who could use it for such purposes; and we gaze at it with
admiring curiosity, as on some gigantic implement of war, which stands
idle among the memorials of ancient days, and makes us wonder what
manner of man he was who could wield as a weapon what we can hardly
lift as a burden.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to point out in detail the sagacity and skill
which mark this part of the <i>Principia</i>. The mode in which the
author obtains the effect of a disturbing force in producing a motion
of the apse of an elliptical orbit (the ninth Section of the first
Book), has always been admired for its ingenuity and elegance. The
general statement of the nature of the principal inequalities produced
by the sun in the motion of a satellite, given in the sixty-sixth
Proposition, is, even yet, one of the best explanations of such
action; and the calculations of the quantity of the effects in the
third Book, for instance, the <i>variation</i> of the moon, the
<i>motion of the nodes</i> and its inequalities, the <i>change of
inclination</i> of the orbit,&#8212;are full of beautiful and
efficacious artifices. But Newton’s inventive faculty was exercised to
an extent greater than these published investigations show. In several
cases he has suppressed the demonstration of his method, and given us
the result only; either from haste or from mere weariness, which might
well overtake one who, while he was struggling with facts and numbers,
with difficulties of conception and practice, was aiming also at that
geometrical elegance of exposition, which he considered as alone fit
for the public eye. Thus, in stating the effect of the eccentricity of
the moon’s orbit upon the motion of the apogee, he says,<a
id="fnanchor33-7" href="#note33-7"><span
class="fnanchor">33</span></a> “The computations, as too intricate and
embarrassed with approximations, I do not choose to introduce.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note33-7"
href="#fnanchor33-7">33</a></span> Schol. to Prop. 35, first
edit.</div>
<p>The computations of the theoretical motion of the moon being thus
difficult, and its irregularities numerous and complex, we may ask
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page409">409</a></span> whether
Newton’s reasoning was sufficient to establish this part of his
theory; namely, that her actual motions arise from her gravitation to
the sun. And to this we may reply, that it was sufficient for that
purpose,&#8212;since it showed that, from Newton’s hypothesis,
inequalities must result, following the laws which the moon’s
inequalities were known to follow;&#8212;since the amount of the
inequalities given by the theory agreed nearly with the rules which
astronomers had collected from observation;&#8212;and since, by the
very intricacy of the calculation, it was rendered probable, that the
first results might be somewhat inaccurate, and thus might give rise
to the still remaining differences between the calculations and the
facts. A <i>Progression of the Apogee</i>; a <i>Regression of the
Nodes</i>; and, besides the Elliptical, or first Inequality, an
inequality, following the law of the <i>Evection</i>, or second
inequality discovered by Ptolemy; another, following the law of the
<i>Variation</i> discovered by Tycho;&#8212;were pointed out in the
first edition of the <i>Principia</i>, as the consequences of the
theory. Moreover, the quantities of these inequalities were calculated
and compared with observation with the utmost confidence, and the
agreement in most instances was striking. The Variation agreed with
Halley’s recent observations within a minute of a degree.<a
id="fnanchor34-7" href="#note34-7"><span
class="fnanchor">34</span></a> The Mean Motion of the Nodes in a year
agreed within less than one-hundredth of the whole.<a
id="fnanchor35-7" href="#note35-7"><span
class="fnanchor">35</span></a> The Equation of the Motion of the Nodes
also agreed well.<a id="fnanchor36-7" href="#note36-7"><span
class="fnanchor">36</span></a> The Inclination of the Plane of the
Orbit to the ecliptic, and its changes, according to the different
situations of the nodes, likewise agreed.<a id="fnanchor37-7"
href="#note37-7"><span class="fnanchor">37</span></a> The Evection has
been already noticed as encumbered with peculiar difficulties: here
the accordance was less close. The Difference of the daily progress of
the Apogee in syzygy, and its daily Regress in Quadratures, is, Newton
says, “4¼ minutes by the Tables, 6⅔ by our calculation.” He boldly
adds, “I suspect this difference to be due to the fault of the
Tables.” In the second edition (1711) he added the calculation of
several other inequalities, as the <i>Annual Equation</i>, also
discovered by Tycho; and he compared them with more recent
observations made by Flamsteed at Greenwich; but even in what has
already been stated, it must be allowed that there is a wonderful
accordance of theory with phenomena, both being very complex in the
rules which they educe.</p>

<p>The same theory which gave these Inequalities in the motion of the
Moon produced by the disturbing force of the sun, gave also <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page410">410</a></span> corresponding
Inequalities in the motions of the Satellites of other planets,
arising from the same cause; and likewise pointed out the necessary
existence of irregularities in the motions of the Planets arising from
their mutual attraction. Newton gave propositions by which the
Irregularities of the motion of Jupiter’s moons might be deduced from
those of our own;<a id="fnanchor38-7" href="#note38-7"><span
class="fnanchor">38</span></a> and it was shown that the motions of
their nodes would be slow by theory, as Flamsteed had found it to be
by observation.<a id="fnanchor39-7" href="#note39-7"><span
class="fnanchor">39</span></a> But Newton did not attempt to calculate
the effect of the mutual action of the planets, though he observes,
that in the case of Jupiter and Saturn this effect is too considerable
to be neglected;<a id="fnanchor40-7" href="#note40-7"><span
class="fnanchor">40</span></a> and he notices in the second edition,<a
id="fnanchor41-7" href="#note41-7"><span
class="fnanchor">41</span></a> that it follows from the theory of
gravity, that the aphelia of Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and Mars,
slightly progress.</p>

<p>In one celebrated instance, indeed, the deviation of the theory of
the <i>Principia</i> from observation was wider, and more difficult to
explain; and as this deviation for a time resisted the analysis of
Euler and Clairaut, as it had resisted the synthesis of Newton, it at
one period staggered the faith of mathematicians in the exactness of
the law of the inverse square of the distance. I speak of the Motion
of the Moon’s Apogee, a problem which has <a
href="#v1page368">already</a> been referred to; and in which Newton’s
method, and all the methods which could be devised for some time
afterwards, gave only half the observed motion; a circumstance which
arose, as was discovered by Clairaut in 1750, from the insufficiency
of the method of approximation. Newton does not attempt to conceal
this discrepancy. After calculating what the motion of apse would be,
upon the assumption of a disturbing force of the same amount as that
which the sun exerts on the moon, he simply says,<a id="fnanchor42-7"
href="#note42-7"><span class="fnanchor">42</span></a> “the apse of the
moon moves about twice as fast.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note42-7"
href="#fnanchor42-7">42</a></span> B. i. Prop. 44, second edit. There
is reason to believe, however, that Newton had, in his unpublished
calculations, rectified this discrepancy.</div>
<p>The difficulty of doing what Newton did in this branch of the
subject, and the powers it must have required, may be judged of from
what has already been stated;&#8212;that no one, with his methods, has
yet been able to add any thing to his labors: few have undertaken to
illustrate what he has written, and no great number have understood it
throughout. The extreme complication of the forces, and of the
conditions under which they act, makes the subject by far the most
thorny walk of mathematics. It is necessary to resolve the action
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page411">411</a></span> into many
elements, such as can be separated; to invent artifices for dealing
with each of these; and then to recompound the laws thus obtained into
one common conception. The moon’s motion cannot be conceived without
comprehending a scheme more complex than the Ptolemaic epicycles and
eccentrics in their worst form; and the component parts of the system
are not, in this instance, mere geometrical ideas, requiring only a
distinct apprehension of relations of space in order to hold them
securely; they are the foundations of mechanical notions, and require
to be grasped so that we can apply to them sound mechanical
reasonings. Newton’s successors, in the next generation, abandoned the
hope of imitating him in this intense mental effort; they gave the
subject over to the operation of algebraical reasoning, in which
symbols think for us, without our dwelling constantly upon their
meaning, and obtain for us the consequences which result from the
relations of space and the laws of force, however complicated be the
conditions under which they are combined. Even Newton’s countrymen,
though they were long before they applied themselves to the method
thus opposed to his, did not produce any thing which showed that they
had mastered, or could retrace, the Newtonian investigations.</p>
<p>Thus the Problem of Three Bodies,<a id="fnanchor43-7"
href="#note43-7"><span class="fnanchor">43</span></a> treated
geometrically, belongs exclusively to Newton; and the proofs of the
mutual action of the sun, planets, and satellites, which depend upon
such reasoning, could not be discovered by any one but him.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note43-7"
href="#fnanchor43-7">43</a></span> See the history of the <i>Problem
of Three Bodies</i>, <i>ante</i>, in Book vi. Chap. vi. <a
href="#b6-6-7">Sect. 7.</a></div>
<p>But we have not yet done with his achievements on this subject; for
some of the most remarkable and beautiful of the reasonings which he
connected with this problem, belong to the next step of his
generalization.</p>
<p>5. <i>Mutual Attraction of all Particles of Matter.</i>&#8212;That
all the parts of the universe are drawn and held together by love, or
harmony, or some affection to which, among other names, that of
attraction may have been given, is an assertion which may very
possibly have been made at various times, by speculators writing at
random, and taking their chance of meaning and truth. The authors of
such casual dogmas have generally nothing accurate or substantial,
either in their conception of the general proposition, or in their
reference to examples of it; and, therefore, their doctrines are no
concern of ours at present. But among those who were really the first
to think of the mutual <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page412">412</a></span> attraction of matter, we cannot help
noticing Francis Bacon; for his notions were so far from being
chargeable with the looseness and indistinctness to which we have
alluded, that he proposed an experiment<a id="fnanchor44-7"
href="#note44-7"><span class="fnanchor">44</span></a> which was to
decide whether the facts were so or not;&#8212;whether the gravity of
bodies to the earth arose from an attraction of the parts of matter
towards each other, or was a tendency towards the centre of the earth.
And this experiment is, even to this day, one of the best which can be
devised, in order to exhibit the universal gravitation of matter: it
consists in the comparison of the rate of going of a clock in a deep
mine, and on a high place. Huyghens, in his book <i>De Causâ
Gravitatis</i>, published in 1690, showed that the earth would have an
oblate form, in consequence of the action of the centrifugal force;
but his reasoning does not suppose gravity to arise from the mutual
attraction of the parts of the earth. The apparent influence of the
moon upon the tides had long been remarked; but no one had made any
progress in truly explaining the mechanism of this influence; and all
the analogies to which reference had been made, on this and similar
subjects, as magnetic and other attractions, were rather delusive than
illustrative, since they represented the attraction as something
peculiar in particular bodies, depending upon the nature of each
body.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note44-7"
href="#fnanchor44-7">44</a></span>  <i>Nov. Org.</i> Lib. ii. Aph.
36.</div>
<p>That all such forces, cosmical and terrestrial, were the same
single force, and that this was nothing more than the insensible
attraction which subsists between one stone and another, was a
conception equally bold and grand; and would have been an
incomprehensible thought, if the views which we have already explained
had not prepared the mind for it. But the preceding steps having
disclosed, between all the bodies of the universe, forces of the same
kind as those which produce the weight of bodies at the earth, and,
therefore, such as exist in every particle of terrestrial matter; it
became an obvious question, whether such forces did not also belong to
all particles of planetary matter, and whether this was not, in fact,
the whole account of the forces of the solar system. But, supposing
this conjecture to be thus suggested, how formidable, on first
appearance at least, was the undertaking of verifying it! For if this
be so, every finite mass of matter exerts forces which are the result
of the infinitely numerous forces of its particles, these forces
acting in different directions. It does not appear, at first sight,
that the law by which the force is related to the distance, will be
the same for the particles as it is for the masses; and, in reality,
it <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page413">413</a></span> is not so,
except in special cases. And, again, in the instance of any effect
produced by the force of a body, how are we to know whether the force
resides in the whole mass as a unit, or in the separate particles? We
may reason, as Newton does,<a id="fnanchor45-7" href="#note45-7"><span
class="fnanchor">45</span></a> that the rule which proves gravity to
belong universally to the planets, proves it also to belong to their
parts; but the mind will not be satisfied with this extension of the
rule, except we can find decisive instances, and calculate the effects
of both suppositions, under the appropriate conditions. Accordingly,
Newton had to solve a new series of problems suggested by this
inquiry; and this he did.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note45-7"
href="#fnanchor45-7">45</a></span> <i>Princip.</i> B. iii. Prop.
7.</div>
<p>These solutions are no less remarkable for the mathematical power
which they exhibit, than the other parts of the <i>Principia</i>. The
propositions in which it is shown that the law of the inverse square
for the particles gives the same law for spherical masses, have that
kind of beauty which might well have justified their being published
for their mathematical elegance alone, even if they had not applied to
any real case. Great ingenuity is also employed in other instances, as
in the case of spheroids of small eccentricity. And when the amount of
the mechanical action of masses of various forms has thus been
assigned, the sagacity shown in tracing the results of such action in
the solar system is truly admirable; not only the general nature of
the effect being pointed out, but its quantity calculated. I speak in
particular of the reasonings concerning the Figure of the Earth, the
Tides, the Precession of the Equinoxes, the Regression of the Nodes of
a ring such as Saturn’s; and of some effects which, at that time, had
not been ascertained even as facts of observation; for instance, the
difference of gravity in different latitudes, and the Nutation of the
earth’s axis. It is true, that in most of these cases, Newton’s
process could be considered only as a rude approximation. In one (the
Precession) he committed an error, and in all, his means of
calculation were insufficient. Indeed these are much more difficult
investigations than the Problem of Three Bodies, in which three points
act on each other by explicit laws. Up to this day, the resources of
modern analysis have been employed upon some of them with very partial
success; and the facts, in all of them, required to be accurately
ascertained and measured, a process which is not completed even now.
Nevertheless the form and nature of the conclusions which Newton did
obtain, were such as to inspire a strong confidence in the competency
of his theory to explain <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page414">414</a></span> all such phenomena as have been spoken
of. We shall <a href="#v1page433">afterwards</a> have to speak of the
labors, undertaken in order to examine the phenomena more exactly, to
which the theory gave occasion.</p>
<p>Thus, then, the theory of the universal mutual gravitation of all
the particles of matter, according to the law of the inverse square of
the distances, was conceived, its consequences calculated, and its
results shown to agree with phenomena. It was found that this theory
took up all the facts of astronomy as far as they had hitherto been
ascertained; while it pointed out an interminable vista of new facts,
too minute or too complex for observation alone to disentangle, but
capable of being detected when theory had pointed out their laws, and
of being used as criteria or confirmations of the truth of the
doctrine. For the same reasoning which explained the evection,
variation, and annual equation of the moon, showed that there must be
many other inequalities besides these; since these resulted from
approximate methods of calculation, in which small quantities were
neglected. And it was known that, in fact, the inequalities hitherto
detected by astronomers did not give the place of the moon with
satisfactory accuracy; so that there was room, among these hitherto
untractable irregularities, for the additional results of the theory.
To work out this comparison was the employment of the succeeding
century; but Newton began it. Thus, at the end of the proposition in
which he asserts,<a id="fnanchor46-7" href="#note46-7"><span
class="fnanchor">46</span></a> that “all the lunar motions and their
irregularities follow from the principles here stated,” he makes the
observation which we have just made; and gives, as examples, the
different motions of the apogee and nodes, the difference of the
change of the eccentricity, and the difference of the moon’s
variation, according to the different distances of the sun. “But this
inequality,” he says, “in astronomical calculations, is usually
referred to the prosthaphæresis of the moon, and confounded with
it.”</p>

href="#fnanchor46-7">46</a></span> B. iii. Prop. 22.</div>
<p><i>Reflections on the Discovery.</i>&#8212;Such, then, is the great
Newtonian Induction of Universal Gravitation, and such its history. It
is indisputably and incomparably the greatest scientific discovery
ever made, whether we look at the advance which it involved, the
extent of the truth disclosed, or the fundamental and satisfactory
nature of this truth. As to the first point, we may observe that any
one of the five steps into which we have separated the doctrine,
would, of itself, have been considered as an important
advance;&#8212;would have conferred distinction on the persons who
made it, and the time to which it belonged. All <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page415">415</a></span> the five steps made
at once, formed not a leap, but a flight,&#8212;not an improvement
merely, but a metamorphosis,&#8212;not an epoch, but a termination.
Astronomy passed at once from its boyhood to mature manhood. Again,
with regard to the extent of the truth, we obtain as wide a
generalization as our physical knowledge admits, when we learn that
every particle of matter, in all times, places, and circumstances,
attracts every other particle in the universe by one common law of
action. And by saying that the truth was of a fundamental and
satisfactory nature, I mean that it assigned, not a rule merely, but a
cause, for the heavenly motions; and that kind of cause which most
eminently and peculiarly we distinctly and thoroughly conceive,
namely, mechanical force. Kepler’s laws were merely <em>formal</em>
rules, governing the celestial motions according to the relations of
space, time, and number; Newton’s was a <span class="correction"
title="emended from casual"><em>causal</em></span> law, referring
these motions to mechanical reasons. It is no doubt conceivable that
future discoveries may both extend and further explain Newton’s
doctrines;&#8212;may make gravitation a case of some wider law, and
may disclose something of the mode in which it operates; questions
with which Newton himself struggled. But, in the mean time, few
persons will dispute, that both in generality and profundity, both in
width and depth, Newton’s theory is altogether without a rival or
neighbor.<a id="fnanchor47-7" href="#note47-7"><span
class="fnanchor">47</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note47-7"
href="#fnanchor47-7">47</a></span> The value and nature of this step
have long been generally acknowledged wherever science is cultivated.
Yet it would appear that there is, in one part of Europe, a school of
philosophers who contest the merit of this part of Newton’s
discoveries. “Kepler,” says a celebrated German metaphysician,*
“discovered the laws of free motion; a discovery of immortal glory. It
has since been the fashion to say that Newton first found out the
proof of these rules. It has seldom happened that the glory of the
first discoverer has been more unjustly transferred to another
person.” It may appear strange that any one in the present day should
hold such language; but if we examine the reasons which this author
gives, they will be found, I think, to amount to this: that his mind
is in the condition in which Kepler’s was; and that the whole range of
mechanical ideas and modes of conception which made the transition
from Kepler and Newton possible, are extraneous to the domain of his
philosophy. Even this author, however, if I understand him rightly,
recognizes Newton as the author of the doctrine of Perturbations.<br />
&#8195;I have given a further account of these views, in a Memoir <i>On
Hegel’s Criticism of Newton’s Principia</i>. Cambridge Transactions,
1849.<br />
<p class="center">* Hegel, <i>Encyclopædia</i>, § 270.</p></div>
<p>The requisite conditions of such a discovery in the mind of its
author were, in this as in other cases, the idea, and its comparison
with facts;&#8212;the conception of the law, and the moulding this
conception in such a form as to correspond with known realities. The
idea of mechanical <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page416">416</a></span> force as the cause of the celestial
motions, had, as we have seen, been for some time growing up in men’s
minds; had gone on becoming more distinct and more general; and had,
in some persons, approached the form in which it was entertained by
Newton. Still, in the mere conception of universal gravitation, Newton
must have gone far beyond his predecessors and contemporaries, both in
generality and distinctness; and in the inventiveness and sagacity
with which he traced the consequences of this conception, he was, as
we have shown, without a rival, and almost without a second. As to the
facts which he had to include in his law, they had been accumulating
from the very birth of astronomy; but those which he had more
peculiarly to take hold of were the facts of the planetary motions as
given by Kepler, and those of the moon’s motions as given by Tycho
Brahe and Jeremy Horrox.</p>
<p>We find here occasion to make a remark which is important in its
bearing on the nature of progressive science. What Newton thus used
and referred to as <em>facts</em>, were the <em>laws</em> which his
predecessors had established. What Kepler and Horrox had put forth as
“theories,” were now established truths, fit to be used in the
construction of other theories. It is in this manner that one theory
is built upon another;&#8212;that we rise from particulars to
generals, and from one generalization to another;&#8212;that we have,
in short, successive steps of induction. As Newton’s laws assumed
Kepler’s, Kepler’s laws assumed as facts the results of the planetary
theory of Ptolemy; and thus the theories of each generation in the
scientific world are (when thoroughly verified and established,<span
class="correction" title="omitted in text">)</span> the facts of the
next generation. Newton’s theory is the circle of generalization which
includes all the others;&#8212;the highest point of the inductive
ascent;&#8212;the catastrophe of the philosophic drama to which Plato
had prologized;&#8212;the point to which men’s minds had been
journeying for two thousand years.</p>
<p><i>Character of Newton.</i>&#8212;It is not easy to anatomize the
constitution and the operations of the mind which makes such an
advance in knowledge. Yet we may observe that there must exist in it,
in an eminent degree, the elements which compose the mathematical
talent. It must possess distinctness of intuition, tenacity and
facility in tracing logical connection, fertility of invention, and a
strong tendency to generalization. It is easy to discover indications
of these characteristics in Newton. The distinctness of his intuitions
of space, and we may add of force also, was seen in the amusements of
his youth; in his constructing clocks and mills, carts and dials, as
well as the facility with which he <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page417">417</a></span> mastered geometry. This fondness for
handicraft employments, and for making models and machines, appears to
be a common prelude of excellence in physical science;<a
id="fnanchor48-7" href="#note48-7"><span
class="fnanchor">48</span></a> probably on this very account, that it
arises from the distinctness of intuitive power with which the child
conceives the shapes and the working of such material combinations.
Newton’s inventive power appears in the number and variety of the
mathematical artifices and combinations which he devised, and of which
his books are full. If we conceive the operation of the inventive
faculty in the only way in which it appears possible to conceive
it;&#8212;that while some hidden source supplies a rapid stream of
possible suggestions, the mind is on the watch to seize and detain any
one of these which will suit the case in hand, allowing the rest to
pass by and be forgotten;&#8212;we shall see what extraordinary
fertility of mind is implied by so many successful efforts; what an
innumerable host of thoughts must have been produced, to supply so
many that deserved to be selected. And since the selection is
performed by tracing the consequences of each suggestion, so as to
compare them with the requisite conditions, we see also what rapidity
and certainty in drawing conclusions the mind must possess as a
talent, and what watchfulness and patience as a habit.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note48-7"
href="#fnanchor48-7">48</a></span> As in Galileo, Hooke, Huyghens, and
others.</div>
<p>The hidden fountain of our unbidden thoughts is for us a mystery;
and we have, in our consciousness, no standard by which we can measure
our own talents; but our acts and habits are something of which we are
conscious; and we can understand, therefore, how it was that Newton
could not admit that there was any difference between himself and
other men, except in his possession of such habits as we have
mentioned, perseverance and vigilance. When he was asked how he made
his discoveries, he answered, “by always thinking about them;” and at
another time he declared that if he had done any thing, it was due to
nothing but industry and patient thought: “I keep the subject of my
inquiry constantly before me, and wait till the first dawning opens
gradually, by little and little, into a full and clear light.” No
better account can be given of the nature of the mental
<em>effort</em> which gives to the philosopher the full benefit of his
powers; but the natural <em>powers</em> of men’s minds are not on that
account the less different. There are many who might wait through ages
of darkness without being visited by any dawn.</p>
<p>The habit to which Newton thus, in some sense, owed his <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page418">418</a></span> discoveries, this
constant attention to the rising thought, and development of its
results in every direction, necessarily engaged and absorbed his
spirit, and made him inattentive and almost insensible to external
impressions and common impulses. The stories which are told of his
extreme absence of mind, probably refer to the two years during which
he was composing his <i>Principia</i>, and thus following out a train
of reasoning the most fertile, the most complex, and the most
important, which any philosopher had ever had to deal with. The
magnificent and striking questions which, during this period, he must
have had daily rising before him; the perpetual succession of
difficult problems of which the solution was necessary to his great
object; may well have entirely occupied and possessed him. “He existed
only to calculate and to think.”<a id="fnanchor49-7"
href="#note49-7"><span class="fnanchor">49</span></a> Often, lost in
meditation, he knew not what he did, and his mind appeared to have
quite forgotten its connection with the body. His servant reported
that, on rising in a morning, he frequently sat a large portion of the
day, half-dressed, on the side of his bed  and that his meals waited
on the table for hours before he came to take them. Even with his
transcendent powers, to do what he did was almost irreconcilable with
the common conditions of human life; and required the utmost devotion
of thought, energy of effort, and steadiness of will&#8212;the
strongest character, as well as the highest endowments, which belong
to man.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note49-7"
href="#fnanchor49-7">49</a></span>  Biot.</div>
<p>Newton has been so universally considered as the greatest example
of a natural philosopher, that his moral qualities, as well as his
intellect, have been referred to as models of the philosophical
character; and those who love to think that great talents are
naturally associated with virtue, have always dwelt with pleasure upon
the views given of Newton by his contemporaries; for they have
uniformly represented him as candid and humble, mild and good. We may
take as an example of the impressions prevalent about him in his own
time, the expressions of Thomson, in the Poem on his Death.<a

general voice of the time. For instance, one of Loggan’s “Views of
Cambridge” is dedicated “Isaaco Newtono . . Mathematico, Physico,
Chymico consummatissimo; nec minus suavitate morum  et candore animi .
. . spectabili.”<br />
&#8195;In opposition to the general current of such testimony, we have
the complaints of Flamsteed, who ascribes to Newton angry language and
harsh conduct in the matter of the publication of the Greenwich
Observations, and of Whiston. Yet even Flamsteed speaks well of his
general disposition. Whiston was himself so weak and prejudiced that
his testimony is worth very little.</div>
<p>[2d Ed.] [In the first edition of the <i>Principia</i>, published
in 1687, Newton showed that the nature of all the then known
inequalities of the moon, and in some cases, their quantities, might
be deduced from the principles which he laid down  but the
determination of the amount and law of most of the inequalities was
deferred to a more favorable opportunity, when he might be furnished
with better astronomical observations. Such observations as he needed
for this purpose had been made by Flamsteed, and for these he applied,
representing how much value their use would add to the observations.
“If,” he says, in 1694, “you publish them without such a theory to
recommend them, they will only be thrown into the heap of the
observations of former astronomers, till somebody shall arise that by
perfecting the theory of the moon shall discover your observations to
be exacter than the rest; but when that shall be, God knows: I fear,
not in your lifetime, if I should die before it is done. For I find
this theory so very intricate, and the theory of gravity so necessary
to it, that I am satisfied it will never be perfected but by somebody
who understands the theory of gravity as well, or better than I do.”
He obtained from Flamsteed the lunar observations for which he
applied, and by using these he framed the Theory of the Moon which is
given as his in David Gregory’s <i>Astronomiæ Elementa</i>.<a
id="fnanchor51-7" href="#note51-7"><span
class="fnanchor">51</span></a> He also obtained from Flamsteed the
diameters of the planets as observed at various times, and the
greatest elongation of Jupiter’s Satellites, both of which, Flamsteed
says, he made use of in his <i>Principia</i>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note51-7"
href="#fnanchor51-7">51</a></span> In the Preface to a <i>Treatise on
Dynamics</i>, Part i., published in 1836, I have endeavored to show
that Newton’s modes of determining several of the lunar inequalities
admitted of an accuracy not very inferior to the modern analytical
methods.</div>
<p>Newton, in his letters to Flamsteed in 1694 and 5, acknowledges
this service.<a id="fnanchor52-7" href="#note52-7"><span

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note52-7"
href="#fnanchor52-7">52</a></span> The quarrel on the subject of the
publication of Flamsteed’s Observations took place at a later period.
Flamsteed wished to have his Observations printed complete and entire.
Halley, who, under the authority of Newton and others, had the
management of the printing, made many alterations and omissions, which
Flamsteed considered as deforming and spoiling the work. The
advantages of publishing a <em>complete</em> series of observations,
now generally understood, were not then known to astronomers in
general, though well known to Flamsteed, and earnestly insisted upon
in his remonstrances. The result was that Flamsteed published his
Observations at his own expense, and finally obtained permission to
destroy the copies printed by Halley, which he did. In 1726, after
Flamsteed’s death, his widow applied to the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford,
requesting that the volume printed by Halley might be removed out of
the Bodleian Library, where it exists, as being “nothing more than an
erroneous abridgment of Mr. Flamsteed’s works,” and unfit to see the
light. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page420">420</a></span></div>

<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>General Remarks.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> doctrine of universal
gravitation, like other great steps in science, required a certain
time to make its way into men’s minds; and had to be confirmed,
illustrated, and completed, by the labors of succeeding philosophers.
As the discovery itself was great beyond former example, the features
of the natural sequel to the discovery were also on a gigantic scale;
and many vast and laborious trains of research, each of which might,
in itself, be considered as forming a wide science, and several of
which have occupied many profound and zealous inquirers from that time
to our own day, come before us as parts only of the verification of
Newton’s Theory. Almost every thing that has been done, and is doing,
in astronomy, falls inevitably under this description; and it is only
when the astronomer travels to the very limits of his vast field of
labor, that he falls in with phenomena which do not acknowledge the
jurisdiction of the Newtonian legislation. We must give some account
of the events of this part of the history of astronomy; but our
narrative must necessarily be extremely brief and imperfect; for the
subject is most large and copious, and our limits are fixed and
narrow. We have here to do with the history of discoveries, only so
far as it illustrates their philosophy. And though the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page421">421</a></span> astronomical
discoveries of the last century are by no means poor, even in interest
of this kind, the generalizations which they involve are far less
important for our object, in consequence of being included in a
previous generalization. Newton shines out so brightly, that all who
follow seem faint and dim. It is not precisely the case which the poet
describes&#8212;</p>

<p class="noind">but our eyes are at least less intently bent on the
astronomers who succeeded, and we attend to their communications with
less curiosity, because we know the end, if not the course of their
story; we know that their speeches have all closed with Newton’s
sublime declaration, asserted in some new form.</p>
<p>Still, however, the account of the verification and extension of
any great discovery is a highly important part of its history. In this
instance it is most important; both from the weight and dignity of the
theory concerned, and the ingenuity and extent of the methods
employed: and, of course, so long as the Newtonian theory still
required verification, the question of the truth or falsehood of such
a grand system of doctrines could not but excite the most intense
curiosity. In what I have said, I am very far from wishing to
depreciate the value of the achievements of modern astronomers, but it
is essential to my purpose to mark the subordination of narrower to
wider truths&#8212;the different character and import of the labors of
those who come before and after the promulgation of a master-truth.
With this warning I now proceed to my narrative.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Reception of the Newtonian Theory in
England.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">There</span> appears to be a popular persuasion
that great discoveries are usually received with a prejudiced and
contentious opposition, and the authors of them neglected or
persecuted. The reverse of this was certainly the case in England with
regard to the discoveries of Newton. As we have already seen, even
before they were published, they were proclaimed by Halley to be
something of transcendent value; and from the moment of their
appearance, they rapidly made their way from one class of thinkers to
another, nearly as fast as the nature of men’s intellectual capacity
allows. Halley, Wren, and all the leading <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page422">422</a></span> members of the Royal Society, appear to
have embraced the system immediately and zealously. Men whose pursuits
had lain rather in literature than in science, and who had not the
knowledge and habits of mind which the strict study of the system
required, adopted, on the credit of their mathematical friends, the
highest estimation of the <i>Principia</i>, and a strong regard for
its author, as Evelyn, Locke, and Pepys. Only five years after the
publication, the principles of the work were referred to from the
pulpit, as so incontestably proved that they might be made the basis
of a theological argument. This was done by Dr. Bentley, when he
preached the Boyle’s Lectures in London, in 1692. Newton himself, from
the time when his work appeared, is never mentioned except in terms of
profound admiration; as, for instance, when he is called by Dr.
Bentley, in his sermon,<a id="fnanchor53-7" href="#note53-7"><span
class="fnanchor">53</span></a> “That very excellent and divine
theorist, Mr. Isaac Newton.” It appears to have been soon suggested,
that the Government ought to provide in some way for a person who was
so great an honor to the nation. Some delay took place with regard to
this; but, in 1695, his friend Mr. Montague, afterwards Earl of
Halifax, at that time Chancellor of the Exchequer, made him Warden of
the Mint; and in 1699, he succeeded to the higher office of Master of
the Mint, a situation worth £1200 or £1500 a year, which he filled to
the end of his life. In 1703, he became President of the Royal
Society, and was annually re-elected to this office during the
remaining twenty-five years of his life. In 1705, he was knighted in
the Master’s Lodge, at Trinity College, by Queen Anne, then on a visit
to the University of Cambridge. After the accession of George the
First, Newton’s conversation was frequently sought by the Princess,
afterwards Queen Caroline, who had a taste for speculative studies,
and was often heard to declare in public, that she thought herself
fortunate in living at a time which enabled her to enjoy the society
of so great a genius. His fame, and the respect paid him, went on
increasing to the end of his life; and when, in 1727, full of years
and glory, his earthly career was ended, his death was mourned as a
national calamity, with the forms usually confined to royalty. His
body lay in state in the Jerusalem chamber; his pall was borne by the
first nobles of the land  and his earthly remains were deposited in
the centre of Westminster Abbey, in the midst of the memorials of the
greatest and wisest men whom England has produced.</p>

href="#fnanchor53-7">53</a></span> Serm. vii. 221.</div>
<p>It cannot be superfluous to say a word or two on the reception of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page423">423</a></span> his philosophy
in the universities of England. These are often represented as places
where bigotry and ignorance resist, as long as it is possible to
resist, the invasion of new truths. We cannot doubt that such opinions
have prevailed extensively, when we find an intelligent and generally
temperate writer, like the late Professor Playfair of Edinburgh, so
far possessed by them, as to be incapable of seeing, or interpreting,
in any other way, any facts respecting Oxford and Cambridge. Yet,
notwithstanding these opinions, it will be found that, in the English
universities, new views, whether in science or in other subjects, have
been introduced as soon as they were clearly established;&#8212;that
they have been diffused from the few to the many more rapidly there
than elsewhere occurs;&#8212;and that from these points, the light of
newly-discovered truths has most usually spread over the land. In most
instances undoubtedly there has been something of a struggle, on such
occasions, between the old and the new opinions. Few men’s minds can
at once shake off a familiar and consistent system of doctrines, and
adopt a novel and strange set of principles as soon as presented; but
all can see that one change produces many, and that change, in itself,
is a source of inconvenience and danger. In the case of the admission
of the Newtonian opinions into Cambridge and Oxford, however, there
are no traces even of a struggle. Cartesianism had never struck its
roots deep in this country; that is, the peculiar hypotheses of
Descartes. The Cartesian books, such, for instance, as that of
Rohault, were indeed in use; and with good reason, for they contained
by far the best treatises on most of the physical sciences, such as
Mechanics, Hydrostatics, Optics, and Formal Astronomy, which could
then be found. But I do not conceive that the Vortices were ever dwelt
upon as a matter of importance in our academic teaching. At any rate,
if they were brought among us, they were soon dissipated. Newton’s
College, and his University, exulted in his fame, and did their utmost
to honor and aid him. He was exempted by the king from the obligation
of taking orders, under which the fellows of Trinity College in
general are; by his college he was relieved from all offices which
might interfere, however slightly, with his studious employments,
though he resided within the walls of the society thirty-five years,
almost without the interruption of a month.<a id="fnanchor54-7"
href="#note54-7"><span class="fnanchor">54</span></a> By the
University he was elected their representative in parliament in 1688,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page424">424</a></span> and again in
1701; and though he was rejected in the dissolution of 1705, those who
opposed him acknowledged him<a id="fnanchor55-7"
href="#note55-7"><span class="fnanchor">55</span></a> to be “the glory
of the University and nation,” but considered the question as a
political one, and Newton as sent “to tempt them from their duty, by
the great and just veneration they had for him.” Instruments and other
memorials, valued because they belonged to him, are still preserved in
his college, along with the tradition of the chambers which he
occupied.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note54-7"
href="#fnanchor54-7">54</a></span> His name is nowhere found on the
college-books, as appointed to any of the offices which usually pass
down the list of resident fellows in rotation. This might be owing in
part, however, to his being Lucasian Professor. The constancy of his
residence in college appears from the <i>exit</i> and <i>redit</i>
book of that time, which is still preserved.</div>

href="#fnanchor55-7">55</a></span> A pamphlet by Styan Thurlby.</div>
<p>The most active and powerful minds at Cambridge became at once
disciples and followers of Newton. Samuel Clarke, afterwards his
friend, defended in the public schools a thesis taken from his
philosophy, as early as 1694; and in 1697 published an edition of
Rohault’s <i>Physics</i>, with notes, in which Newton is frequently
referred to with expressions of profound respect, though the leading
doctrines of the <i>Principia</i> are not introduced till a later
edition, in 1703. In 1699, Bentley, whom we have already mentioned as
a Newtonian, became Master of Trinity College; and in the same year,
Whiston, another of Newton’s disciples, was appointed his deputy as
professor of mathematics. Whiston delivered the Newtonian doctrines,
both from the professor’s chair, and in works written for the use of
the University; yet it is remarkable that a taunt respecting the late
introduction of the Newtonian system into the Cambridge course of
education, has been founded on some peevish expressions which he uses
in his Memoirs, written at a period when, having incurred expulsion
from his professorship and the University, he was naturally querulous
and jaundiced in his views. In 1709&#8211;10, Dr. Laughton, who was
tutor in Clare Hall, procured himself to be appointed moderator of the
University disputations, in order to promote the diffusion of the new
mathematical doctrines. By this time the first edition of the
<i>Principia</i> was become rare, and fetched a great price. Bentley
urged Newton to publish a new one; and Cotes, by far the first, at
that time, of the mathematicians of Cambridge, undertook to
superintend the printing, and the edition was accordingly published in
1713.</p>
<p>[2d Ed.] [I perceive that my accomplished German translator,
Littrow, has incautiously copied the insinuations of some modern
writers to the effect that Clarke’s reference to Newton, in his
Edition of Rohault’s <i>Physics</i>, was a mode of introducing
Newtonian doctrines covertly, when it was not allowed him to introduce
such novelties <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page425">425</a></span>
openly. I am quite sure that any one who looks into this matter will
see that this supposition of any unwillingness at Cambridge to receive
Newton’s doctrine is quite absurd, and can prove nothing but the
intense prejudices of those who maintain such an opinion. Newton
received and held his professorship amid the unexampled admiration of
all contemporary members of the University. Whiston, who is sometimes
brought as an evidence against Cambridge on this point, says, “I with
immense pains set myself with the utmost zeal to the study of Sir
Isaac Newton’s wonderful discoveries in his <i>Philosophiæ Naturalis
Principia Mathematica</i>, one or two of which <em>lectures I had
heard him read in the public schools</em>, though I understood them
not at the time.” As to Rohault’s <i>Physics</i>, it really did
contain the best mechanical philosophy of the time;&#8212;the
doctrines which were held by Descartes in common with Galileo, and
with all the sound mathematicians who succeeded them. Nor does it look
like any great antipathy to novelty in the University of Cambridge,
that this book, which was quite as novel in its doctrines as Newton’s
<i>Principia</i>, and which had only been published at Paris in 1671,
had obtained a firm hold on the University in less than twenty years.
Nor is there any attempt made in Clarke’s notes to conceal the novelty
of Newton’s discoveries, but on the contrary, admiration is claimed
for them as new.</p>
<p>The promptitude with which the Mathematicians of the University of
Cambridge adopted the best parts of the mechanical philosophy of
Descartes, and the greater philosophy of Newton, in the seventeenth
century, has been paralleled in our own times, in the promptitude with
which they have adopted and followed into their consequences the
Mathematical Theory of Heat of Fourier and Laplace, and the Undulatory
Theory of Light of Young and Fresnel.</p>
<p>In Newton’s College, we possess, besides the memorials of him
mentioned above (which include two locks of his silver-white hair), a
paper in his own handwriting, describing the preparatory reading which
was necessary in order that our College students might be able to read
the <i>Principia</i>. I have printed this paper in the Preface to my
Edition of the First Three Sections of the <i>Principia</i> in the
original Latin (1846).</p>
<p>Bentley, who had expressed his admiration for Newton in his Boyle’s
Lectures in 1692, was made Master of the College in 1699, as I have
stated; and partly, no doubt, in consequence of the Newtonian sermons
which he had preached. In his administration of the College, he
zealously stimulated and assisted the exertions of Cotes, Whiston, and
other disciples of Newton. Smith, Bentley’s successor as Master of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page426">426</a></span> the College,
erected a statue of Newton in the College Chapel (a noble work of
Roubiliac), with the inscription, <i>Qui genus humanum ingenio
superavit.</i>]</p>
<p>At Oxford, David Gregory and Halley, both zealous and distinguished
disciples of Newton, obtained the Savilian professorships of astronomy
and geometry in 1691 and 1703.</p>
<p>David Gregory’s <i>Astronomiæ Physicæ et Geometricæ Elementa</i>
issued from the Oxford Press in 1702. The author, in the first
sentence of the Preface, states his object to be to explain the
mechanics of the universe (Physica Cœlestis), which Isaac Newton, the
Prince of Geometers, has carried to a point of elevation which all
look up to with admiration. And this design is executed by a full
exposition of the Newtonian doctrines and their results. Keill, a
pupil of Gregory, followed his tutor to Oxford, and taught the
Newtonian philosophy there in 1700, being then Deputy Sedleian
Professor. He illustrated his lectures by experiments, and published
an Introduction to the <i>Principia</i> which is not out of use even
yet.</p>
<p>In Scotland, the Newtonian philosophy was accepted with great
alacrity, as appears by the instances of David Gregory and Keill.
David Gregory was professor at Edinburgh before he removed to Oxford,
and was succeeded there by his brother James. The latter had, as early
as 1690, printed a thesis, containing in twenty-two propositions, a
compend of Newton’s <i>Principia</i>.<a id="fnanchor56-7"
href="#note56-7"><span class="fnanchor">56</span></a> Probably these
were intended as theses for academical disputations; as Laughton at
Cambridge introduced the Newtonian philosophy into these exercises.
The formula at Cambridge, in use till very recently in these
disputations, was “<i>Rectè statuit Newtonus de Motu Lunæ</i>;” or the
like.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note56-7"
href="#fnanchor56-7">56</a></span> See Hutton’s <i>Math. Dict.</i>,
art. <i>James Gregory</i>. If it fell in with my plan to notice
derivative works, I might speak of Maclaurin’s admirable <i>Account of
Sir Isaac Newton’s Discoveries</i>, published in 1748. This is still
one of the best books on the subject. The late Professor Rigaud’s
<i>Historical Essay on the First Publication of Sir Isaac Newton’s
“Principia”</i> (Oxf. 1838) contains a careful and candid view of the
circumstances of that event.</div>
<p>The general diffusion of these opinions in England took place, not
only by means of books, but through the labors of various experimental
lecturers, like Desaguliers, who removed from Oxford to London in
1713; when he informs us,<a id="fnanchor57-7" href="#note57-7"><span
class="fnanchor">57</span></a> that “he found the Newtonian philosophy
generally received among persons of all ranks and professions, and
even among the ladies by the help of experiments.”</p>

href="#fnanchor57-7">57</a></span> Desag. <i>Pref.</i></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page427">427</a></span> We might
easily trace in our literature indications of the gradual progress of
the Newtonian doctrines. For instance, in the earlier editions of
Pope’s <i>Dunciad</i>, this couplet occurred, in the description of
the effects of the reign of Dulness:</p>
<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
   <span class="i0">Philosophy, that reached the heavens
before,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Shrinks to her hidden cause, and is no

<p class="noind">“And this,” says his editor, Warburton, “was intended
as a censure on the Newtonian philosophy. For the poet had been misled
by the prejudices of foreigners, as if that philosophy had recurred to
the occult qualities of Aristotle. This was the idea he received of it
from a man educated much abroad, who had read every thing, but every
thing superficially.<a id="fnanchor58-7" href="#note58-7"><span
class="fnanchor">58</span></a> When I hinted to him how he had been
imposed upon, he changed the lines with great pleasure into a
compliment (as they now stand) on that divine genius, and a satire on
that very folly by which he himself had been misled.” In 1743 it was
printed,</p>
<div class="poem">

   <span class="i0">Philosophy, that leaned on heaven

<p class="noind">The Newtonians repelled the charge of dealing in
occult causes;<a id="fnanchor59-7" href="#note59-7"><span
class="fnanchor">59</span></a> and, referring gravity to the will of
the Deity, as the First Cause, assumed a superiority over those whose
philosophy rested in second causes.</p>

<p>To the cordial reception of the Newtonian theory by the English
astronomers, there is only one conspicuous exception; which is,
however, one of some note, being no other than Flamsteed, the
Astronomer Royal, a most laborious and exact observer. Flamsteed at
first listened with complacency to the promises of improvements in the
Lunar Tables, which the new doctrines held forth, and was willing to
assist Newton, and to receive assistance from him. But after a time,
he lost his respect for Newton’s theory, and ceased to take any
interest in it. He then declared to one of his correspondents,<a
id="fnanchor60-7" href="#note60-7"><span
class="fnanchor">60</span></a> “I have determined to lay these
crotchets of Sir Isaac Newton’s wholly aside.” We need not, however,
find any difficulty in this, if we recollect that Flamsteed, though a
good observer, was no philosopher;&#8212;never understood by a Theory
any thing more than a Formula which should predict results;&#8212;and
was incapable of comprehending the object of Newton’s theory, which
was to assign causes as well as rules, and to satisfy the conditions
of Mechanics as well as of Geometry.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note60-7"
href="#fnanchor60-7">60</a></span> Baily’s <i>Account of Flamsteed,
&amp;c.</i>, p. 309.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page428">428</a></span> [2d Ed.] [I
do not see any reason to retract what was thus said; but it ought
perhaps to be distinctly said that on these very accounts Flamsteed’s
rejection of Newton’s rules did not imply a denial of the doctrine of
gravitation. In the letter above quoted, Flamsteed says that he has
been employed upon the Moon, and that “the heavens reject that
equation of Sir I. Newton which Gregory and Newton called his sixth: I
had then [when he wrote before] compared but 72 of my observations
with the tables, now I have examined above 100 more. I find them all
firm in the same, and the seventh [equation] too.” And thereupon he
comes to the determination above stated.</p>
<p>At an earlier period Flamsteed, as I have said, had received
Newton’s suggestions with great deference, and had regulated his own
observations and theories with reference to them. The calculation of
the lunar inequalities upon the theory of gravitation was found by
Newton and his successors to be a more difficult and laborious task
than he had anticipated, and was not performed without several trials
and errors. One of the equations was at first published (in Gregory’s
<i>Astronomiæ Elementa</i>) with a wrong sign. And when Newton had
done all, Flamsteed found that the rules were far from coming up to
the degree of accuracy which had been claimed for them, that they
could give the moon’s place true to 2 or 3 minutes. It was not till
considerably later that this amount of exactness was attained.</p>
<p>The late Mr. Baily, to whom astronomy and astronomical literature
are so deeply indebted, in his <i>Supplement to the Account of
Flamsteed</i>, has examined with great care and great candor the
assertion that Flamsteed did not understand Newton’s Theory. He
remarks, very justly, that what Newton himself at first presented as
his Theory, might more properly be called Rules for computing lunar
tables, than a physical Theory in the modern acceptation of the term.
He shows, too, that Flamsteed had read the <i>Principia</i> with
attention.<a id="fnanchor61-7" href="#note61-7"><span
class="fnanchor">61</span></a> Nor do I doubt that many considerable
mathematicians gave the same imperfect assent to Newton’s doctrine
which Flamsteed did. But when we find that others, as Halley, David
Gregory, and Cotes, at once not only saw in the doctrine a source of
true formulæ, but also a magnificent physical discovery, we are
obliged, I think, to make Flamsteed, in this respect, an exception to
the first class of astronomers of his own time.</p>

suggestion by Newton as the results of Theory (<i>Supp.</i> p. 692,

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Reception of the Newtonian Theory
abroad.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> reception of the Newtonian theory on
the Continent, was much more tardy and unwilling than in its native
island. Even those whose mathematical attainments most fitted them to
appreciate its proofs, were prevented by some peculiarity of view from
adopting it as a system; as Leibnitz, Bernoulli, Huyghens; who all
clung to one modification or other of the system of vortices. In
France, the Cartesian system had obtained a wide and popular
reception, having been recommended by Fontenelle with the graces of
his style; and its empire was so firm and well established in that
country, that it resisted for a long time the pressure of Newtonian
arguments. Indeed, the Newtonian opinions had scarcely any disciples
in France, till Voltaire asserted their claims, on his return from
England in 1728: until then, as he himself says, there were not twenty
Newtonians out of England.</p>
<p>The hold which the Philosophy of Descartes had upon the minds of
his countrymen is, perhaps, not surprising. He really had the merit, a
great one in the history of science, of having completely overturned
the Aristotelian system, and introduced the philosophy of matter and
motion. In all branches of mixed mathematics, as we have already said,
his followers were the best guides who had yet appeared. His
hypothesis of vortices, as an explanation of the celestial motions,
had an apparent advantage over the Newtonian doctrine, in this
respect;&#8212;that it referred effects to the most intelligible, or
at least most familiar kinds of mechanical causation, namely, pressure
and impulse. And above all, the system was acceptable to most minds,
in consequence of being, as was pretended, deduced from a few simple
principles by necessary consequences; and of being also directly
connected with metaphysical and theological speculations. We may add,
that it was modified by its mathematical adherents in such a way as to
remove most of the objections to it. A vortex revolving about a centre
could be constructed, or at least it was supposed that it could be
constructed, so as to produce a tendency of bodies to the centre. In
all cases, therefore, where a central force acted, a vortex was
supposed; but in reasoning to the results of this hypothesis, it was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page430">430</a></span> easy to leave
out of sight all other effects of the vortex, and to consider only the
central force; and when this was done, the Cartesian mathematician
could apply to his problems a mechanical principle of some degree of
consistency. This reflection will, in some degree, account for what at
first seems so strange;&#8212;the fact that the language of the French
mathematicians is Cartesian, for almost half a century after the
publication of the <i>Principia</i> of Newton.</p>
<p>There was, however, a controversy between the two opinions going on
all this time, and every day showed the insurmountable difficulties
under which the Cartesians labored. Newton, in the <i>Principia</i>,
had inserted a series of propositions, the object of which was to
prove, that the machinery of vortices could not be accommodated to one
part of the celestial phenomena, without contradicting another part. A
more obvious difficulty was the case of gravity of the earth; if this
force arose, as Descartes asserted, from the rotation of the earth’s
vortex about its axis, it ought to tend directly to the axis, and not
to the centre. The asserters of vortices often tried their skill in
remedying this vice in the hypothesis, but never with much success.
Huyghens supposed the ethereal matter of the vortices to revolve about
the centre in all directions; Perrault made the strata of the vortex
increase in velocity of rotation as they recede from the centre;
Saurin maintained that the circumambient resistance which comprises
the vortex will produce a pressure passing through the centre. The
elliptic form of the orbits of the planets was another difficulty.
Descartes had supposed the vortices themselves to be oval  but others,
as John Bernoulli, contrived ways of having elliptical motion in a
circular vortex.</p>
<p>The mathematical prize-questions proposed by the French Academy,
naturally brought the two sets of opinions into conflict. The
Cartesian memoir of John Bernoulli, to which we have just referred,
was the one which gained the prize in 1730. It not unfrequently
happened that the Academy, as if desirous to show its impartiality,
divided the prize between the Cartesians and Newtonians. Thus in 1734,
the question being, the cause of the inclination of the orbits of the
planets, the prize was shared between John Bernoulli, whose Memoir was
founded on the system of vortices, and his son Daniel, who was a
Newtonian. The last act of homage of this kind to the Cartesian system
was performed in 1740, when the prize on the question of the Tides was
distributed between Daniel Bernoulli, Euler, Maclaurin, and
Cavallieri; the last of whom had tried to patch up and amend the
Cartesian hypothesis on this subject. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page431">431</a></span></p>
<p>Thus the Newtonian system was not adopted in France till the
Cartesian generation had died off; Fontenelle, who was secretary to
the Academy of Sciences, and who lived till 1756, died a Cartesian.
There were exceptions; for instance, Delisle, an astronomer who was
selected by Peter the Great of Russia, to found the Academy of St
Petersburg; who visited England in 1724, and to whom Newton then gave
his picture, and Halley his Tables. But in general, during the
interval, that country and this had a national difference of creed on
physical subjects. Voltaire, who visited England in 1727, notices this
difference in his lively manner. “A Frenchman who arrives in London,
finds a great alteration in philosophy, as in other things. He left
the world full [<span class="correction" title="italicised in
text">a</span> <i>plenum</i>], he finds it empty. At Paris you see the
universe composed of vortices of subtle matter, in London we see
nothing of the kind. With you it is the pressure of the moon which
causes the tides of the sea, in England it is the sea which gravitates
towards the moon; so that when you think the moon ought to give us
high water, these gentlemen believe that you ought to have low water;
which unfortunately we cannot test by experience; for in order to do
that, we should have examined the Moon and the Tides at the moment of
the creation. You will observe also that the sun, which in France has
nothing to do with the business, here comes in for a quarter of it.
Among you Cartesians, all is done by an impulsion which one does not
well understand; with the Newtonians, it is done by an attraction of
which we know the cause no better. At Paris you fancy the earth shaped
like a melon, at London it is flattened on the two sides.”</p>
<p>It was Voltaire himself as we have said, who was mainly
instrumental in giving the Newtonian doctrines currency in France. He
was at first refused permission to print his <i>Elements of the
Newtonian Philosophy</i>, by the Chancellor, D’Aguesseaux, who was a
Cartesian; but after the appearance of this work in 1738, and of other
writings by him on the same subject, the Cartesian edifice, already
without real support or consistency, crumbled to pieces and
disappeared. The first Memoir in the <i>Transactions of the French
Academy</i> in which the doctrine of central force is applied to the
solar system, is one by the Chevalier de Louville in 1720, <i>On the
Construction and Theory of Tables of the Sun</i>. In this, however,
the mode of explaining the motions of the planets by means of an
original impulse and an attractive force is attributed to Kepler, not
to Newton. The first Memoir which refers to the universal gravitation
of matter is by Maupertuis, in <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page432">432</a></span> 1736. But Newton was not unknown or
despised in France till this time. In 1699 he was admitted one of the
very small number of foreign associates of the French Academy of
Sciences. Even Fontenelle, who, as we have said, never adopted his
opinions, spoke of him in a worthy manner, in the <i>Eloge</i> which
he composed on the occasion of his death. At a much earlier period
too, Fontenelle did homage to his fame. The following passage refers,
I presume, to Newton. In the <i>History</i> of the Academy for 1708,
which is written by the secretary, he says,<a id="fnanchor62-7"
href="#note62-7"><span class="fnanchor">62</span></a> in referring to
the difficulty which the comets occasion in the Cartesian hypothesis:
“We might relieve ourselves at once from all the embarrassment which
arises from the directions of these motions, by suppressing, as has
been done <em>by one of the greatest geniuses of the age</em>, all
this immense fluid matter, which we commonly suppose between the
planets, and conceiving them suspended in a perfect void.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note62-7"
href="#fnanchor62-7">62</a></span> <i>Hist. Ac. Sc.</i> 1708. p.
103.</div>
<p>Comets, as the above passage implies, were a kind of artillery
which the Cartesian <i>plenum</i> could not resist. When it appeared
that the paths of such wanderers traversed the vortices in all
directions, it was impossible to maintain that these imaginary
currents governed the movements of bodies immersed in them  and the
mechanism ceased to have any real efficacy. Both these phenomena of
comets, and many others, became objects of a stronger and more general
interest, in consequence of the controversy between the rival parties;
and thus the prevalence of the Cartesian system did not seriously
impede the progress of sound knowledge. In some cases, no doubt, it
made men unwilling to receive the truth, as in the instance of the
deviation of the comets from the zodiacal motion; and again, when
Römer discovered that light was not instantaneously propagated. But it
encouraged observation and calculation, and thus forwarded the
verification and extension of the Newtonian system; of which process
we must now consider some of the incidents. <span class="pagenum"><a

<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> verification of the Law of
Universal Gravitation as the governing principle of all cosmical
phenomena, led, as we have already stated, to a number of different
lines of research, all long and difficult. Of these we may treat
successively, the motions of the Moon, of the Sun, of the Planets, of
the Satellites, of Comets; we may also consider separately the Secular
Inequalities, which at first sight appear to follow a different law
from the other changes; we may then speak of the results of the
principle as they affect this Earth, in its Figure, in the amount of
Gravity at different places, and in the phenomena of the Tides. Each
of these subjects has lent its aid to confirm the general law: but in
each the confirmation has had its peculiar difficulties, and has its
separate history. Our sketch of this history must be very rapid, for
our aim is only to show what is the kind and course of the
confirmation which such a theory demands and receives.</p>
<p>For the same reason we pass over many events of this period which
are highly important in the history of astronomy. They have lost much
of their interest for us, and even for common readers, because they
are of a class with which we are already familiar, truths included in
more general truths to which our eyes now most readily turn. Thus, the
discovery of new satellites and planets is but a repetition of what
was done by Galileo: the determination of their nodes and apses, the
reduction of their motions to the law of the ellipse, is but a fresh
exemplification of the discoveries of Kepler. Otherwise, the formation
of Tables of the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn, the discovery of
the eccentricities of the orbits, and of the motions of the nodes and
apses, by Cassini, Halley, and others, would rank with the great
achievements in astronomy. Newton’s peculiar advance in the
<i>Tables</i> of the celestial motions is the introduction of
Perturbations. To these motions, so affected, we now proceed. <span

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Application of the Newtonian Theory to
the Moon.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> Motions of the Moon may be first spoken
of, as the most obvious and the most important of the applications of
the Newtonian Theory. The verification of such a theory consists, as
we have seen in previous cases, in the construction of Tables derived
from the theory, and the comparison of these with observation. The
advancement of astronomy would alone have been a sufficient motive for
this labor; but there were other reasons which urged it on with a
stronger impulse. A perfect Lunar Theory, if the theory could be
perfected, promised to supply a method of finding the Longitude of any
place on the earth’s surface; and thus the verification of a theory
which professed to be complete in its foundations, was identified with
an object of immediate practical use to navigators and geographers,
and of vast acknowledged value. A good method for the near discovery
of the longitude had been estimated by nations and princes at large
sums of money. The Dutch were willing to tempt Galileo to this task by
the offer of a chain of gold: Philip the Third of Spain had promised a
reward for this object still earlier;<a id="fnanchor63-7"
href="#note63-7"><span class="fnanchor">63</span></a> the parliament
of England, in 1714, proposed a recompense of 20,000<i>l.</i>
sterling; the Regent Duke of Orléans, two years afterwards, offered
100,000 francs for the same purpose. These prizes, added to the love
of truth and of fame, kept this object constantly before the eyes of
mathematicians, during the first half of the last century.</p>

<p>If the Tables could be so constructed as to represent the moon’s
real place in the heavens with extreme precision, as it would be seen
from a <em>standard</em> observatory, the observation of her apparent
place, as seen from any other point of the earth’s surface, would
enable the observer to find his longitude from the standard point. The
motions of the moon had hitherto so ill agreed with the best Tables,
that this method failed altogether. Newton had discovered the ground
of this want of agreement. He had shown that the same force which
produces the Evection, Variation, and Annual Equation, must produce
also a long series of other Inequalities, of various magnitudes and
cycles, which perpetually drag the moon before or behind the place
where she would be sought by an astronomer who knew only of those
principal and notorious inequalities. But to calculate and apply the
new inequalities, was no slight undertaking. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page435">435</a></span></p>
<p>In the first edition of the <i>Principia</i> in 1687, Newton had
not given any calculations of new inequalities affecting the longitude
of the moon. But in David Gregory’s <i>Elements of Physical and
Geometrical Astronomy</i>, published in 1702, is inserted<a
id="fnanchor64-7" href="#note64-7"><span
class="fnanchor">64</span></a> “Newton’s Lunar Theory as applied by
him to Practice;” in which the great discoverer has given the results
of his calculations of eight of the lunar Equations, their quantities,
epochs, and periods. These calculations were for a long period the
basis of new Tables of the Moon, which were published by various
persons;<a id="fnanchor65-7" href="#note65-7"><span
class="fnanchor">65</span></a> as by Delisle in 1715 or 1716,
Grammatici at Ingoldstadt in 1726, Wright in 1732, Angelo Capelli at
Venice in 1733, Dunthorne at Cambridge in 1739.</p>

<p>Flamsteed had given Tables of the Moon upon Horrox’s theory in
1681, and wished to improve them; and though, as we have seen, he
would not, or could not, accept Newton’s doctrines in their whole
extent, Newton communicated his theory to the observer in the shape in
which he could understand it and use it:<a id="fnanchor66-7"
href="#note66-7"><span class="fnanchor">66</span></a> and Flamsteed
employed these directions in constructing new Lunar Tables, which he
called his <i>Theory</i>.<a id="fnanchor67-7" href="#note67-7"><span
class="fnanchor">67</span></a> These Tables were not published till
long after his death, by Le Monnier at Paris in 1746. They are said,
by Lalande,<a id="fnanchor68-7" href="#note68-7"><span
class="fnanchor">68</span></a> not to differ much from Halley’s.
Halley’s Tables of the Moon were printed in 1719 or 1720, but not
published till after his death in 1749. They had been founded on
Flamsteed’s observations and his own; and when, in 1720, Halley
succeeded Flamsteed in the post of Astronomer Royal at Greenwich, and
conceived that he had the means of much improving what he had done
before, he began by printing what he had already executed.<a

<i>Nouvelles Tables de la Lune</i> in <span class="correction"
title="emended from 1453">1753</span>, published upwards of fifty
years after Gregory’s <i>Astronomy</i>, may be considered as the first
lunar tables formed <em>solely</em> on Newton’s principles. Though
Wright in 1732 published <i>New and Correct Tables of the Lunar
Motions according to the Newtonian Theory</i>, Newton’s rules were in
them only partially adopted. In 1735 Leadbetter published his
<i>Uranoscopia</i>, in which those rules were more fully followed. But
these <i>Newtonian Tables</i> did not supersede Flamsteed’s Horroxian
Tables, till both were supplanted by those of Mayer.
<p class="center">*<i>Supp.</i> p. 702.</p></div>
<p>But Halley had long proposed a method, different from that of
Newton, but marked by great ingenuity, for amending the Lunar Tables.
He proposed to do this by the use of a cycle, which we have mentioned
as one of the earliest discoveries in astronomy;&#8212;the Period of
223 lunations, or eighteen years and eleven days, the Chaldean <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page436">436</a></span> Saros. This period
was anciently used for predicting the eclipses of the sun and moon;
for those eclipses which happen during this period, are repeated again
in the same order, and with nearly the same circumstances, after the
expiration of one such period and the commencement of a second. The
reason of this is, that at the end of such a cycle, the moon is in
nearly the same position with respect to the sun, her nodes, and her
apogee, as she was at first; and is only a few degrees distant from
the same part of the heavens. But on the strength of this
consideration, Halley conjectured that all the irregularities of the
moon’s motion, however complex they may be, would recur after such an
interval; and that, therefore, if the requisite corrections were
determined by observation for one such period, we might by means of
them give accuracy to the Tables for all succeeding periods. This idea
occurred to him before he was acquainted with Newton’s views.<a
id="fnanchor70-7" href="#note70-7"><span
class="fnanchor">70</span></a> After the lunar theory of the
<i>Principia</i> had appeared, he could not help seeing that the idea
was confirmed; for the inequalities of the moon’s motion, which arise
from the attraction of the sun, will depend on her positions with
regard to the sun, the apogee, and the node; and therefore, however
numerous, will recur when these positions recur.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note70-7"
href="#fnanchor70-7">70</a></span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1731, p.
188.</div>
<p>Halley announced, in 1691,<a id="fnanchor71-7"
href="#note71-7"><span class="fnanchor">71</span></a> his intention of
following this idea into practice; in a paper in which he corrected
the text of three passages in Pliny, in which this period is
mentioned, and from which it is sometimes called the Plinian period.
In 1710, in the preface to a new edition to Street’s <i>Caroline
Tables</i>, he stated that he had already confirmed it to a
considerable extent.<a id="fnanchor72-7" href="#note72-7"><span
class="fnanchor">72</span></a> And even after Newton’s theory had been
applied, he still resolved to use his cycle as a means of obtaining
further accuracy. On succeeding to the Observatory at Greenwich in
1720, he was further delayed by finding that the instruments had
belonged to Flamsteed, and were removed by his executors. “And this,”
he says,<a id="fnanchor73-7" href="#note73-7"><span
class="fnanchor">73</span></a> “was the more grievous to me, on
account of my advanced age, being then in my sixty-fourth year: which
put me past all hopes of ever living to see a complete period of
eighteen years’ observation. But, thanks to God, he has been pleased
hitherto (in 1731) to afford me sufficient health and strength to
execute my office, in all its parts, with my own hands and eyes,
without any assistance or interruption, during one whole period of the
moon’s <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page437">437</a></span> apogee,
which period is performed in somewhat less than nine years.” He found
the agreement very remarkable, and conceived hopes of attaining the
great object, of finding the Longitude with the requisite degree of
exactness; nor did he give up his labors on this subject till he had
completed his Plinian period in 1739.</p>

<p>The accuracy with which Halley conceived himself able to predict
the moon’s place<a id="fnanchor74-7" href="#note74-7"><span
class="fnanchor">74</span></a> was within two minutes of space, or one
fifteenth of the breadth of the moon herself. The accuracy required
for obtaining the national reward was considerably greater. Le Monnier
pursued the idea of Halley.<a id="fnanchor75-7" href="#note75-7"><span
class="fnanchor">75</span></a> But before Halley’s method had been
completed, it was superseded by the more direct prosecution of
Newton’s views.</p>

<p>We have already remarked, in the history of analytical mechanics,
that in the Lunar Theory, considered as one of the cases of the
Problem of Three Bodies, no advance was made beyond what Newton had
done, till mathematicians threw aside the Newtonian artifices, and
applied the newly developed generalizations of the analytical method.
The first great apparent deficiency in the agreement of the law of
universal gravitation with astronomical observation, was removed by
Clairaut’s improved approximation to the theoretical Motion of the
Moon’s Apogee, in 1750; yet not till it had caused so much
disquietude, that Clairaut himself had suggested a modification of the
law of attraction; and it was only in tracing the consequences of this
suggestion, that he found the Newtonian law of the inverse square to
be that which, when rightly developed, agreed with the facts. Euler
solved the problem by the aid of his analysis in 1745,<a
id="fnanchor76-7" href="#note76-7"><span
class="fnanchor">76</span></a> and published Tables of the Moon in
1746. His tables were not very accurate at first;<a id="fnanchor77-7"
href="#note77-7"><span class="fnanchor">77</span></a> but he,
D’Alembert, and Clairaut, continued to labor at this object, and the
two latter published Tables of the Moon in 1754.<a id="fnanchor78-7"
href="#note78-7"><span class="fnanchor">78</span></a> Finally, Tobias
Mayer, an astronomer of Göttingen, having compared Euler’s tables with
observations, corrected them so successfully, that in 1753 he
published Tables of the Moon, which really did possess the accuracy
which Halley only flattered himself that he had attained. Mayer’s
success in his first Tables encouraged him to make them still more
perfect. He applied himself to the mechanical theory of the moon’s
orbit; corrected all the coefficients of the series by a great number
of observations; and in 1755, sent his new Tables to London as worthy
to claim the prize offered for the discovery of longitude. He died
soon after <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page438">438</a></span> (in
1762), at the early age of thirty-nine, worn out by his incessant
labors; and his widow sent to London a copy of his Tables with
additional corrections. These Tables were committed to Bradley, then
Astronomer Royal, in order to be compared with observation. Bradley
labored at this task with unremitting zeal and industry, having
himself long entertained hopes that the Lunar Method of finding the
Longitude might be brought into general use. He and his assistant,
Gael Morris, introduced corrections into Mayer’s Tables of 1755. In
his report of 1756, he says,<a id="fnanchor79-7"
href="#note79-7"><span class="fnanchor">79</span></a> that he did not
find any difference so great as a minute and a quarter; and in 1760,
he adds, that this deviation had been further diminished by his
corrections. It is not foreign to our purpose to observe the great
labor which this verification required. Not less than 1220
observations, and long calculations founded upon each, were employed.
The accuracy which Mayer’s Tables possessed was considered to entitle
them to a part of the parliamentary reward; they were printed in 1770,
and his widow received 3000<i>l.</i> from the English nation. At the
same time, Euler, whose Tables had been the origin and foundation of
Mayer’s, also had a recompense of the same amount.</p>

<p>This public national acknowledgment of the practical accuracy of
these Tables is, it will be observed, also a solemn recognition of the
truth of the Newtonian theory, as far as truth can be judged of by men
acting under the highest official responsibility, and aided by the
most complete command of the resources of the skill and talents of
others. The finding the Longitude is thus the seal of the moon’s
gravitation to the sun and earth; and with this occurrence, therefore,
our main concern with the history of the Lunar Theory ends. Various
improvements have been since introduced into this research; but on
these we, with so many other subjects before us, must forbear to
enter.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Application of the Newtonian Theory to
the Planets, Satellites, and Earth.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> theories of the Planets and Satellites,
as affected by the law of universal gravitation, and therefore by
perturbations, were naturally subjects of interest, after the
promulgation of that law. Some of the effects of the mutual attraction
of the planets had, indeed, already attracted notice. The inequality
produced by the mutual attraction of Jupiter and Saturn cannot be
overlooked by a good observer. In the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page439">439</a></span> preface to the second edition of the
<i>Principia</i>, Cotes remarks,<a id="fnanchor80-7"
href="#note80-7"><span class="fnanchor">80</span></a> that the
perturbation of Jupiter and Saturn is not unknown to astronomers. In
Halley’s Tables it was noticed<a id="fnanchor81-7"
href="#note81-7"><span class="fnanchor">81</span></a> that there are
very great deviations from regularity in these two planets, and these
deviations are ascribed to the perturbing force of the planets on each
other; but the correction of these by a suitable equation is left to
succeeding astronomers.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note80-7"

xxi.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note81-7"
href="#fnanchor81-7">81</a></span> End of Planetary Tables.</div>
<p>The motion of the planes and apsides of the planetary orbits was
one of the first results of their mutual perturbation which was
observed. In 1706, La Hire and Maraldi compared Jupiter with the
Rudolphine Tables, and those of Bullialdus: it appeared that his
aphelion had advanced, and that his nodes had regressed. In 1728, J.
Cassini found that Saturn’s aphelion had in like manner travelled
forwards. In 1720, when Louville refused to allow in his solar tables
the motion of the aphelion of the earth, Fontenelle observed that this
was a misplaced scrupulousness, since the aphelion of Mercury
certainly advances. Yet this reluctance to admit change and
irregularity was not yet overcome. When astronomers had found an
approximate and apparent constancy and regularity, they were willing
to believe it absolute and exact. In the satellites of Jupiter, for
instance, they were unwilling to admit even the eccentricity of the
orbits; and still more, the variation of the nodes, inclinations, and
apsides. But all the fixedness of these was successively disproved.
Fontenelle in 1732, on the occasion of Maraldi’s discovery of the
change of inclination of the fourth satellite, expresses a suspicion
that all the elements might prove liable to change. “We see,” says he,
“the constancy of the inclination already shaken in the three first
satellites, and the eccentricity in the fourth. The immobility of the
nodes holds out so far, but there are strong indications that it will
share the same fate.”</p>
<p>The motions of the nodes and apsides of the satellites are a
necessary part of the Newtonian theory; and even the Cartesian
astronomers now required only data, in order to introduce these
changes into their Tables.</p>
<p>The complete reformation of the Tables of the Sun, Planets, and
Satellites, which followed as a natural consequence from the
revolution which Newton had introduced, was rendered possible by the
labors of the great constellation of mathematicians of whom we have
spoken in the last book, Clairaut, Euler, D’Alembert, and their
successors; and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page440">440</a></span>
it was carried into effect in the course of the last century. Thus
Lalande applied Clairaut’s theory to Mars, as did Mayer; and the
inequalities in this case, says Bailly<a id="fnanchor82-7"
href="#note82-7"><span class="fnanchor">82</span></a> in 1785, may
amount to two minutes, and therefore must not be neglected. Lalande
determined the inequalities of Venus, as did Father Walmesley, an
English mathematician; these were found to reach only to thirty
seconds.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note82-7"
href="#fnanchor82-7">82</a></span> <i>Ast. Mod.</i> iii. 170.</div>
<p>The Planetary Tables<a id="fnanchor83-7" href="#note83-7"><span
class="fnanchor">83</span></a> which were in highest repute, up to the
end of the last century, were those of Lalande. In these, the
perturbations of Jupiter and Saturn were introduced, their magnitude
being such that they cannot be dispensed with; but the Tables of
Mercury, Venus, and Mars, had no perturbations. Hence these latter
Tables might be considered as accurate enough to enable the observer
to find the object, but not to test the theory of perturbations. But
when the calculation of the mutual disturbances of the planets was
applied, it was always found that it enabled mathematicians to bring
the theoretical places to coincide more exactly with those observed.
In improving, as much as possible, this coincidence, it is necessary
to determine the mass of each planet; for upon that, according to the
law of universal gravitation, its disturbing power depends. Thus, in
1813, Lindenau published Tables of Mercury, and concluded, from them,
that a considerable increase of the supposed mass of Venus was
necessary to reconcile theory with observation.<a id="fnanchor84-7"
href="#note84-7"><span class="fnanchor">84</span></a> He had published
Tables of Venus in 1810, and of Mars in 1811. And, in proving
Bouvard’s Tables of Jupiter and Saturn, values were obtained of the
masses of those planets. The form in which the question of the truth
of the doctrine of universal gravitation now offers itself to the
minds of astronomers, is this:&#8212;that it is taken for granted that
it will account for the motions of the heavenly bodies, and the
question is, with what supposed masses it will give the <em>best</em>
account.<a id="fnanchor85-7" href="#note85-7"><span

href="#fnanchor85-7">85</a></span> Among the most important
corrections of the supposed masses of the planets, we may notice that
of Jupiter, by Professor Airy.  This determination of Jupiter’s mass
was founded, not on the effect as seen in perturbations, but on a much
more direct datum, the time of revolution of his fourth satellite. It
appeared, from this calculation, that Jupiter’s mass required to be
increased by about <span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>80</sub></span>th. This result agrees
with that which has been derived by German astronomers from the
perturbations which the attractions of Jupiter produce in the four new
planets, and has been generally adopted as an improvement of the
elements of our system.</div>
<p>The question of perturbation is exemplified in the satellites also.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page441">441</a></span> Thus the
satellites of Jupiter are not only disturbed by the sun, as the moon
is, but also by each other, as the planets are. This mutual action
gives rise to some very curious relations among their motions; which,
like most of the other leading inequalities, were forced upon the
notice of astronomers by observation before they were obtained by
mathematical calculation. In Bradley’s remarks upon his own Tables of
Jupiter’s Satellites, published among Halley’s Tables, he observes
that the places of the three interior satellites are affected by
errors which recur in a cycle of 437 days, answering to the time in
which they return to the same relative position with regard to each
other, and to the axis of Jupiter’s shadow. Wargentin, who had noticed
the same circumstance without knowledge of what Bradley had done,
applied it, with all diligence, to the purpose of improving the tables
of the satellites in 1746. But, at a later period, Laplace
established, by mathematical reasoning, the very curious theorem on
which this cycle depends, which he calls the <i>libration of Jupiter’s
satellites</i>; and Delambre was then able to publish Tables of
Jupiter’s Satellites more accurate than those of Wargentin, which he
did in 1789.<a id="fnanchor86-7" href="#note86-7"><span

<p>The progress of physical astronomy from the time of Euler and
Clairaut, has consisted of a series of calculations and comparisons of
the most abstruse and recondite kind. The formation of Tables of the
Planets and Satellites from the theory, required the solution of
problems much more complex than the original case of the Problem of
Three Bodies. The real motions of the planets and their orbits are
rendered still further intricate by this, that all the lines and
points to which we can refer them, are themselves in motion. The task
of carrying order and law into this mass of apparent confusion, has
required a long series of men of transcendent intellectual powers; and
a perseverance and delicacy of observation, such as we have not the
smallest example of in any other subject. It is impossible here to
give any detailed account of these labors; but we may mention one
instance of the complex considerations which enter into them. The
nodes of Jupiter’s fourth satellite do not go backwards,<a
id="fnanchor87-7" href="#note87-7"><span
class="fnanchor">87</span></a> as the Newtonian theory seems to
require; they advance upon Jupiter’s orbit. But then, it is to be
recollected that the theory requires the nodes to retrograde upon the
orbit of the perturbing body, which is here the third satellite; and
Lalande showed that, by the necessary relations of space, the latter
motion may be retrograde though the former is direct.</p>

href="#fnanchor87-7">87</a></span> Bailly, iii. 175.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page442">442</a></span> Attempts
have been made, from the time of the solution of the Problem of three
bodies to the present, to give the greatest possible accuracy to the
Tables of the Sun, by considering the effect of the various
perturbations to which the earth is subject. Thus, in 1756, Euler
calculated the effect of the attractions of the planets on the earth
(the prize-question of the French Academy of Sciences), and Clairaut
soon after. Lacaille, making use of these results, and of his own
numerous observations, published Tables of the Sun. In 1786,
Delambre<a id="fnanchor88-7" href="#note88-7"><span
class="fnanchor">88</span></a> undertook to verify and improve these
tables, by comparing them with 314 observations made by Maskelyne, at
Greenwich, in 1775 and 1784, and in some of the intermediate years. He
corrected most of the elements; but he could not remove the
uncertainty which occurred respecting the amount of the inequality
produced by the reaction of the moon. He admitted also, in pursuance
of Clairaut’s theory, a second term of this inequality depending on
the moon’s latitude; but irresolutely, and half disposed to reject it
on the authority of the observations. Succeeding researches of
mathematicians have shown, that this term is not admissible as a
result of mechanical principles. Delambre’s Tables, thus improved,
were exact to seven or eight seconds;<a id="fnanchor89-7"
href="#note89-7"><span class="fnanchor">89</span></a> which was
thought, and truly, a very close coincidence for the time. But
astronomers were far from resting content with this. In 1806, the
French Board of Longitude published Delambre’s improved Solar Tables;
and in the <i>Connaissance des Tems</i> for 1816, Burckhardt gave the
results of a comparison of Delambre’s Tables with a great number of
Maskelyne’s observations;&#8212;far greater than the number on which
they were founded.<a id="fnanchor90-7" href="#note90-7"><span
class="fnanchor">90</span></a> It appeared that the epoch, the
perigee, and the eccentricity, required sensible alterations, and that
the mass of Venus ought to be reduced about one-ninth, and that of the
Moon to be sensibly diminished. In 1827, Professor Airy<a
id="fnanchor91-7" href="#note91-7"><span
class="fnanchor">91</span></a> compared Delambre’s tables with 2000
Greenwich observations, made with the new transit-instrument at
Cambridge, and deduced from this comparison the correction of the
elements. These in general agreed closely with Burckhardt’s, excepting
that a diminution of Mars appeared necessary. Some discordances,
however, led Professor Airy to suspect the existence of an inequality
which had escaped the sagacity of Laplace and Burckhardt. And, a few
weeks after this suspicion had been expressed, the same mathematician
announced to the Royal Society that he had <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page443">443</a></span> detected, in the planetary theory such
an inequality, hitherto unnoticed, arising from the mutual attraction
of Venus and the Earth. Its whole effect on the earth’s longitude,
would be to increase or diminish it by nearly three seconds of space,
and its period is about 240 years. “This term,” he adds, “accounts
completely for the difference of the secular motions given by the
comparison of the epochs of 1783 and 1821, and by that of the epochs
of 1801 and 1821.”</p>

<p>Many excellent Tables of the motions of the sun, moon, and planets,
were published in the latter part of the last century; but the Bureau
des Longitudes which was established in France in 1795, endeavored to
give new or improved tables of most of these motions. Thus were
produced Delambre’s Tables of the Sun, Burg’s Tables of the Moon,
Bouvard’s Tables of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. The agreement between
these and observation is, in general, truly marvellous.</p>
<p>We may notice here a difference in the mode of referring to
observation when a theory is first established, and when it is
afterwards to be confirmed and corrected. It was remarked as a merit
in the method of Hipparchus, and an evidence of the mathematical
coherence of his theory, that in order to determine the place of the
sun’s apogee, and the eccentricity of his orbit, he required to know
nothing besides the lengths of winter and spring. But if the fewness
of the requisite data is a beauty in the first fixation of a theory,
the multitude of observations to which it applies is its excellence
when it is established; and in correcting Tables, mathematicians take
far more data than would be requisite to determine the elements. For
the theory ought to account for <em>all</em> the facts: and since it
will not do this with mathematical rigor (for observation is not
perfect), the elements are determined, not so as to satisfy any
selected observations, but so as to make the whole mass of error as
small as possible. And thus, in the adaptation of theory to
observation, even in its most advanced state, there is room for
sagacity and skill, prudence and judgment.</p>
<p>In this manner, by selecting the best mean elements of the motions
of the heavenly bodies, the observed motions deviate from this mean in
the way the theory points out, and constantly return to it. To this
general rule, of the constant return to a mean, there are, however,
some apparent exceptions, of which we shall now speak. ~Additional

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 4.&#8212;<i>Application of the Newtonian Theory to
Secular Inequalities.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">Secular</span> Inequalities in the motions of the
heavenly bodies occur in consequence of changes in the elements of the
solar system, which go on progressively from age to age. The example
of such changes which was first studied by astronomers, was the
Acceleration of the Moon’s Mean Motion, discovered by Halley. The
observed fact was, that the moon now moves in a very small degree
quicker than she did in the earlier ages of the world. When this was
ascertained, the various hypotheses which appeared likely to account
for the fact were reduced to calculation. The resistance of the medium
in which the heavenly bodies move was the most obvious of these
hypotheses. Another, which was for some time dwelt upon by Laplace,
was the successive transmission of gravity, that is, the hypothesis
that the gravity of the earth takes a certain finite time to reach the
moon. But none of these suppositions gave satisfactory conclusions;
and the strength of Euler, D’Alembert, Lagrange, and Laplace, was for
a time foiled by this difficulty. At length, in 1787, Laplace
announced to the Academy that he had discovered the true cause of this
acceleration, and that it arose from the action of the sun upon the
moon, combined with the secular variation of the eccentricity of the
earth’s orbit. It was found that the effects of this combination would
exactly account for the changes which had hitherto so perplexed
mathematicians. A very remarkable result of this investigation was,
that “this Secular Inequality of the motion of the moon is periodical,
but it requires millions of years to re-establish itself;” so that
after an almost inconceivable time, the acceleration will become a
retardation. Laplace some time after (in 1797), announced other
discoveries, relative to the secular motions of the apogee and the
nodes of the moon’s orbit. Laplace collected these researches in his
“Theory of the Moon,” which he published in the third volume of the
<i>Mécanique Céleste</i> in 1802.</p>
<p>A similar case occurred with regard to an acceleration of Jupiter’s
mean motion, and a retardation of Saturn’s, which had been observed by
Cassini, Maraldi, and Horrox. After several imperfect attempts by
other mathematicians, Laplace, in 1787, found that there resulted from
the mutual attraction of these two planets a great Inequality, of
which the period is 929 years and a half, and which has accelerated
Jupiter and retarded Saturn ever since the restoration of astronomy.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page445">445</a></span></p>
<p>Thus the secular inequalities of the celestial motions, like all
the others, confirm the law of universal gravitation. They are called
“secular,” because ages are requisite to unfold their existence, and
because they are not obviously periodical. They might, in some
measure, be considered as extensions of the Newtonian theory, for
though Newton’s law accounts for such facts, he did not, so far as we
know, foresee such a result of it. But on the other hand, they are
exactly of the same nature as those which he did foresee and
calculate. And when we call them <em>secular</em> in opposition to
<em>periodical</em>, it is not that there is any real difference, for
they, too, have their cycle; but it is that we have assumed our
<em>mean</em> motion without allowing for these long inequalities. And
thus, as Laplace observes on this very occasion,<a id="fnanchor92-7"
href="#note92-7"><span class="fnanchor">92</span></a> the lot of this
great discovery of gravitation is no less than this, that every
apparent exception becomes a proof, every difficulty a new occasion of
a triumph. And such, as he truly adds, is the character of a true
theory,&#8212;of a real representation of nature.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note92-7"
href="#fnanchor92-7">92</a></span> <i>Syst. du Monde</i>, 8vo, ii.
37.</div>
<p>It is impossible for us here to enumerate even the principal
objects which have thus filled the triumphal march of the Newtonian
theory from its outset up to the present time. But among these secular
changes, we may mention the Diminution of the Obliquity of the
Ecliptic, which has been going on from the earliest times to the
present. This change has been explained by theory, and shown to have,
like all the other changes of the system, a limit, after which the
diminution will be converted into an increase.</p>
<p>We may mention here some subjects of a kind somewhat different from
those just spoken of. The true theoretical quantity of the Precession
of the Equinoxes, which had been erroneously calculated by Newton, was
shown by D’Alembert to agree with observation. The constant
coincidence of the Nodes of the Moon’s Equator with those of her
Orbit, was proved to result from mechanical principles by Lagrange.
The curious circumstance that the Time of the Moon’s rotation on her
axis is equal to the Time of her revolution about the earth, was shown
to be consistent with the results of the laws of motion by Laplace.
Laplace also, as we have seen, explained certain remarkable relations
which constantly connect the longitudes of the three first satellites
of Jupiter; Bailly and Lagrange analyzed and explained the curious
librations of the nodes and inclinations of their orbits; and Laplace
traced the effect of Jupiter’s oblate figure on their motions, <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page446">446</a></span> which masks the other
causes of inequality, by determining the direction of the motions of
the <i>perijove</i> and node of each satellite.</p>
<h4 id="b7-4-5"><i>Sect.</i> 5.&#8212;<i>Application of the Newtonian
Theory to the New Planets.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">We</span> are now so accustomed to consider the
Newtonian theory as true, that we can hardly imagine to ourselves the
possibility that those planets which were not discovered when the
theory was founded, should contradict its doctrines. We can scarcely
conceive it possible that Uranus or Ceres should have been found to
violate Kepler’s laws, or to move without suffering perturbations from
Jupiter and Saturn. Yet if we can suppose men to have had any doubt of
the exact and universal truth of the doctrine of universal
gravitation, at the period of these discoveries, they must have
scrutinized the motions of these new bodies with an interest far more
lively than that with which we now look for the predicted return of a
comet. The solid establishment of the Newtonian theory is thus shown
by the manner in which we take it for granted not only in our
reasonings, but in our feelings. But though this is so, a short notice
of the process by which the new planets were brought within the domain
of the theory may properly find a place here.</p>
<p>William Herschel, a man of great energy and ingenuity, who had made
material improvements in reflecting telescopes, observing at Bath on
the 13th of March, 1781, discovered, in the constellation Gemini, a
star larger and less luminous than the fixed stars. On the application
of a more powerful telescope, it was seen magnified, and two days
afterwards he perceived that it had changed its place. The attention
of the astronomical world was directed to this new object, and the
best astronomers in every part of Europe employed themselves in
following it along the sky.<a id="fnanchor93-7" href="#note93-7"><span
class="fnanchor">93</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note93-7"
href="#fnanchor93-7">93</a></span> Voiron, <i>Hist. Ast.</i> p.
12.</div>
<p>The admission of an eighth planet into the long-established list,
was a notion so foreign to men’s thoughts at that time, that other
suppositions were first tried. The orbit of the new body was at first
calculated as if it had been a comet running in a parabolic path. But
in a few days the star deviated from the course thus assigned it: and
it was in vain that in order to represent the observations, the
perihelion distance of the parabola was increased from fourteen to
eighteen times the earth’s distance from the sun. Saron, of the
Academy of Sciences of Paris, is said<a id="fnanchor94-7"
href="#note94-7"><span class="fnanchor">94</span></a> to have been the
first person who perceived that the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page447">447</a></span> places were better represented by a
circle than by a parabola: and Lexell, a celebrated mathematician of
Petersburg, found that a motion in a circular orbit, with a radius
double of that of Saturn, would satisfy all the observations. This
made its period about eighty-two years.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note94-7"
href="#fnanchor94-7">94</a></span> Ibid.</div>
<p>Lalande soon discovered that the circular motion was subject to a
sensible inequality: the orbit was, in fact, an ellipse, like those of
the other planets. To determine the equation of the centre of a body
which revolves so slowly, would, according to the ancient methods,
have required many years; but Laplace contrived methods by which the
elliptical elements were determined from four observations, within
little more than a year from its first discovery by Herschel. These
calculations were soon followed by tables of the new planet, published
by Nouet.</p>
<p>In order to obtain additional accuracy, it now became necessary to
take account of the perturbations. The French Academy of Sciences
proposed, in 1789, the construction of new Tables of this Planet as
its prize-question. It is a curious illustration of the constantly
accumulating evidence of the theory, that the calculation of the
perturbations of the planet enabled astronomers to discover that it
had been observed as a star in three different positions in former
times; namely, by Flamsteed in 1690, by Mayer in 1756, and by Le
Monnier in 1769. Delambre, aided by this discovery and by the theory
of Laplace, calculated Tables of the planet, which, being compared
with observation for three years, never deviated from it more than
seven seconds. The Academy awarded its prize to these Tables, they
were adopted by the astronomers of Europe, and the planet of Herschel
now conforms to the laws of attraction, along with those ancient
members of the known system from which the theory was inferred.</p>
<p>The history of the discovery of the other new planets, Ceres,
Pallas, Juno, and Vesta, is nearly similar to that just related,
except that their planetary character was more readily believed. The
first of these was discovered on the first day of this century by
Piazzi, the astronomer at Palermo; but he had only begun to suspect
its nature, and had not completed his third observation, when his
labors were suspended by a dangerous illness; and on his recovery the
star was invisible, being lost in the rays of the sun.</p>
<p>He declared it to be a planet with an elliptical orbit; but the
path which it followed, on emerging from the neighborhood of the sun,
was not that which Piazzi had traced out for it. Its extreme smallness
made it difficult to rediscover; and the whole of the year 1801 was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page448">448</a></span> employed in
searching the sky for it in vain. At last, after many trials, Von Zach
and Olbers again found it, the one on the last day of 1801, the other
on the first day of 1802. Gauss and Burckhardt immediately used the
new observations in determining the elements of the orbit; and the
former invented a new method for the purpose. Ceres now moves in a
path of which the course and inequalities are known, and can no more
escape the scrutiny of astronomers.</p>
<p>The second year of the nineteenth century also produced its planet.
This was discovered by Dr. Olbers, a physician of Bremen, while he was
searching for Ceres among the stars of the constellation Virgo. He
found a star which had a perceptible motion even in the space of two
hours. It was soon announced as a new planet, and received from its
discoverer the name of Pallas. As in the case of Ceres, Burckhardt and
Gauss employed themselves in calculating its orbit. But some peculiar
difficulties here occurred. Its eccentricity is greater than that of
any of the old planets, and the inclination of its orbit to the
ecliptic is not less than thirty-five degrees. These circumstances
both made its perturbations large, and rendered them difficult to
calculate. Burckhardt employed the known processes of analysis, but
they were found insufficient: and the Imperial Institute (as the
French Academy was termed during the reign of Napoleon) proposed the
Perturbations of Pallas as a prize-question.</p>
<p>To these discoveries succeeded others of the same kind. The German
astronomers agreed to examine the whole of the zone in which Ceres and
Pallas move; in the hope of finding other planets, fragments, as
Olbers conceived they might possibly be, of one original mass. In the
course of this research, Mr. Harding of Lilienthal, on the first of
September, 1804, found a new star, which he soon was led to consider
as a planet. Gauss and Burckhardt also calculated the elements of this
orbit, and the planet was named Juno.</p>
<p>After this discovery, Olbers sought the sky for additional
fragments of his planet with extraordinary perseverance. He conceived
that one of two opposite constellations, the Virgin or the Whale, was
the place where its separation must have taken place; and where,
therefore, all the orbits of all the portions must pass. He resolved
to survey, three times a year, all the small stars in these two
regions. This undertaking, so curious in its nature, was successful.
The 29th of March, 1807, he discovered Vesta, which was soon found to
be a planet. And to show the manner in which Olbers pursued his
labors, we may state that he afterwards published a notification that
he had examined the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page449">449</a></span> same parts of the heavens with such
regularity, that he was certain no new planet had passed that way
between 1808 and 1816. Gauss and Burckhardt computed the orbit of
Vesta; and when Gauss compared one of his orbits with twenty-two
observations of M. Bouvard, he found the errors below seventeen
seconds of space in right ascension, and still less in
declination.</p>
<p>The elements of all these orbits have been successively improved,
and this has been done entirely by the German mathematicians.<a
id="fnanchor95-7" href="#note95-7"><span
class="fnanchor">95</span></a> These perturbations are calculated, and
the places for some time before and after opposition are now given in
the Berlin Ephemeris. “I have lately observed,” says Professor Airy,
“and compared with the Berlin Ephemeris, the right ascensions of Juno
and Vesta, and I find that they are rather more accurate than those of
Venus:” so complete is the confirmation of the theory by these new
bodies; so exact are the methods of tracing the theory to its
consequences.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note95-7"
href="#fnanchor95-7">95</a></span> Airy, <i>Rep.</i> 157.</div>
<p>We may observe that all these new-discovered bodies have received
names taken from the ancient mythology. In the case of the first of
these, astronomers were originally divided; the discoverer himself
named it the <i>Georgium Sidus</i>, in honor of his patron, George the
Third; Lalande and others called it <i>Herschel</i>. Nothing can be
more just than this mode of perpetuating the fame of the author of a
discovery; but it was felt to be ungraceful to violate the homogeneity
of the ancient system of names. Astronomers tried to find for the
hitherto neglected denizen of the skies, an appropriate place among
the deities to whose assembly he was at last admitted; and
<i>Uranus</i>, the father of Saturn, was fixed upon as best suiting
the order of the course.</p>
<p>The mythological nomenclature of planets appeared, from this time,
to be generally agreed to. Piazzi termed his <i>Ceres Ferdinandea</i>.
The first term, which contains a happy allusion to Sicily, the country
of the discovery in modern, and of the goddess in ancient, times, has
been accepted; the attempt to pay a compliment to royalty out of the
products of science, in this as in most other cases, has been set
aside. Pallas, Juno, and Vesta, were named, without any peculiar
propriety of selection, according to the choice of their discoverers.

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 6.&#8212;<i>Application of the Newtonian Theory to
Comets.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">A few</span> words must be said upon another class
of bodies, which at first seemed as lawless as the clouds and winds;
and which astronomy <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page450">450</a></span> has reduced to a regularity as complete
as that of the sun;&#8212;upon <i>Comets</i>. No part of the Newtonian
discoveries excited a more intense interest than this. These anomalous
visitants were anciently gazed at with wonder and alarm; and might
still, as in former times, be accused of “perplexing nations,” though
with very different fears and questionings. The conjecture that they,
too, obeyed the law of universal gravitation, was to be verified by
showing that they described a curve such as that force would produce.
Hevelius, who was a most diligent observer of these objects, had,
without reference to gravitation, satisfied himself that they moved in
parabolas.<a id="fnanchor96-7" href="#note96-7"><span
class="fnanchor">96</span></a> To determine the elements of the
parabola from observations, even Newton called<a id="fnanchor97-7"
href="#note97-7"><span class="fnanchor">97</span></a> “problema longe
difficillimum.” Newton determined the orbit of the comet of 1680 by
certain graphical methods. His methods supposed the orbit to be a
parabola, and satisfactorily represented the motion in the visible
part of the comet’s path. But this method did not apply to the
possible return of the wandering star. Halley has the glory of having
first detected a periodical comet, in the case of that which has since
borne his name. But this great discovery was not made without labor.
In 1705, Halley<a id="fnanchor98-7" href="#note98-7"><span
class="fnanchor">98</span></a> explained how the parabolic orbit of a
planet may be determined from three observations; and, joining example
to precept, himself calculated the positions and orbits of twenty-four
comets. He found, as the reward of this industry, that the comets of
1607 and of 1531 had the same orbit as that of 1682. And here the
intervals are also nearly the same, namely, about seventy-five years.
Are the three comets then identical? In looking back into the history
of such appearances, he found comets recorded in 1456, in 1380, and in
1305; the intervals are still the same, seventy-five or seventy-six
years. It was impossible now to doubt that they were the periods of a
revolving body; that the comet was a planet; its orbit a long ellipse,
not a parabola.<a id="fnanchor99-7" href="#note99-7"><span

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note99-7"
href="#fnanchor99-7">99</a></span> The importance of Halley’s labors
on Comets has always been acknowledged. In speaking of Halley’s
<i>Synopsis Astronomicæ Cometicæ</i>, Delambre says (<i>Ast.</i>
xviii. <i>Siècle</i>, p. 130), “Voilà bien, depuis Kepler, ce qu’on a
fait de plus grand, de plus beau, de plus neuf en astronomie.” Halley,
in predicting the comet of 1758, says, if it returns, “Hoc primum ab
homine Anglo iuventum fuisse non inficiabitur æqua posteritas.”</div>
<p>But if this were so, the Comet must reappear in 1758 or 1759.
Halley predicted that it would do so; and the fulfilment of this
prediction was naturally looked forwards to, as an additional stamp of
the truths of the theory of gravitation. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page451">451</a></span></p>
<p>But in all this, the Comet had been supposed to be affected only by
the attraction of the sun. The planets must disturb its motion as they
disturb each other. How would this disturbance affect the time and
circumstances of its reappearance? Halley had proposed, but not
attempted to solve, this question.</p>
<p>The effect of perturbations upon a comet defeats all known methods
of approximation, and requires immense labor. “Clairaut,” says
Bailly,<a id="fnanchor100-7" href="#note100-7"><span
class="fnanchor">100</span></a> “undertook this: with courage enough
to dare the adventure, he had talent enough to obtain a memorable
victory;” the difficulties, the labors, grew upon him as he advanced,
but he fought his way through them, assisted by Lalande, and by a
female calculator, Madame Lepaute. He predicted that the comet would
reach its perihelion April 13, 1759, but claimed the license of a
month for the inevitable inaccuracy of a calculation which, in
addition to all other sources of error, was made in haste, that it
might appear as a prediction. The comet justified his calculations and
his caution together; for it arrived at its perihelion on the 13th of
March.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note100-7"

<p>Two other Comets, of much shorter period, have been detected of
late years; Encke’s, which revolves round the sun in three years and
one-third, and Biela’s which describes an ellipse, not extremely
eccentric, in six years and three-quarters. These bodies, apparently
thin and vaporous masses, like other comets, have, since their orbits
were calculated, punctually conformed to the law of gravitation. If it
were still doubtful whether the more conspicuous comets do so, these
bodies would tend to prove the fact, by showing it to be true in an
intermediate case.</p>
<p>[2d Ed.] [A third Comet of short period was discovered by Faye, at
the Observatory of Paris, Nov. 22, 1843. It is included between the
orbits of Mars and Saturn, and its period is seven years and
three-tenths.</p>
<p>This is commonly called <i>Faye’s Comet</i>, as the two mentioned
in the text are called <i>Encke’s</i> and <i>Biela’s</i>. In the
former edition I had expressed my assent to the rule proposed by M.
Arago, that the latter ought to be called <i>Gambart’s Comet</i>, in
honor of the astronomer who first proved it to revolve round the Sun.
But astronomers in general have used the former name, considering that
the discovery and observation of the object are more distinct and
conspicuous merits than a calculation founded upon the observations of
others. And in reality <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page452">452</a></span> Biela had great merit in the discovery
of his Comet’s periodicity, having set about his search of it from an
anticipation of its return founded upon former observations.</p>
<p>Also a Comet was discovered by De Vico at Rome on Aug. 22, 1844,
which was found to describe an elliptical orbit having its aphelion
near the orbit of Jupiter, which is consequently one of those of short
period. And on Feb. 26, 1846, M. Brorsen of Kiel discovered a
telescopic Comet whose orbit is found to be elliptical.]</p>
<p>We may add to the history of Comets, that of Lexell’s, which, in
1770, appeared to be revolving in a period of about five years, and
whose motion was predicted accordingly. The prediction was
disappointed; but the failure was sufficiently explained by the
comet’s having passed close to Jupiter, by which occurrence its orbit
was utterly deranged.</p>
<p>It results from the theory of universal gravitation, that Comets
are collections of extremely attenuated matter. Lexell’s is supposed
to have passed twice (in 1767 and 1779) through the system of
Jupiter’s Satellites, without disturbing their motions, though
suffering itself so great a disturbance as to have its orbit entirely
altered. The same result is still more decidedly proved by the last
appearance of Biela’s Comet. It appeared double, but the two bodies
did not perceptibly affect each other’s motions, as I am informed by
Professor Challis of Cambridge, who observed both of them from Jan. 23
to Mar. 25, 1846. This proves the quantity of matter in each body to
have been exceedingly small.</p>
<p>Thus, no verification of the Newtonian theory, which was possible
in the motions of the stars, has yet been wanting. The return of
Halley’s Comet again in 1835, and the extreme exactitude with which it
conformed to its predicted course, is a testimony of truth, which must
appear striking even to the most incurious respecting such matters.<a

take 1378 or 1380 for the appearance in that century, if we begin with
that, we have only <em>seven</em> appearances, namely, in 1378 or
1380, in 1456, in 1531, in 1607, in 1682, in 1759, and in 1835.</div>
<h4 id="b7-4-7"><i>Sect.</i> 7.&#8212;<i>Application of the Newtonian
Theory to the Figure of the Earth.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> Heavens had thus been consulted
respecting the Newtonian doctrine, and the answer given, over and over
again, in a thousand <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page453">453</a></span> different forms, had been, that it was
true; nor had the most persevering cross-examination been able to
establish any thing of contradiction or prevarication. The same
question was also to be put to the Earth and the Ocean, and we must
briefly notice the result.</p>
<p>According to the Newtonian principles, the form of the earth must
be a globe somewhat flattened at the poles. This conclusion, or at
least the amount of the flattening, depends not only upon the
existence and law of attraction, but upon its belonging to each
particle of the mass separately; and thus the experimental
confirmation of the form asserted from calculation, would be a
verification of the theory in its widest sense. The application of
such a test was the more necessary to the interests of science,
inasmuch as the French astronomers had collected from their measures,
and had connected with their Cartesian system, the opinion that the
earth was not <em>oblate</em> but <em>oblong</em>. Dominic Cassini had
measured seven degrees of latitude from Amiens to Perpignan, in 1701,
and found them to decrease in going from south to north. The
prolongation of this measure to Dunkirk confirmed the same result. But
if the Newtonian doctrine was true, the contrary ought to be the case,
and the degrees ought to increase in proceeding towards the pole.</p>
<p>The only answer which the Newtonians could at this time make to the
difficulty thus presented, was, that an arc so short as that thus
measured, was not to be depended upon for the determination of such a
question; inasmuch as the inevitable errors of observation might
exceed the differences which were the object of research. It would,
undoubtedly, have become the English to have given a more complete
answer, by executing measurements under circumstances not liable to
this uncertainty. The glory of doing this, however, they for a long
time abandoned to other nations. The French undertook the task with
great spirit.<a id="fnanchor102-7" href="#note102-7"><span
class="fnanchor">102</span></a> In 1733, in one of the meetings of the
French Academy, when this question was discussed, De la Condamine, an
ardent and eager man, proposed to settle this question by sending
members of the Academy to measure a degree of the meridian near the
equator, in order to compare it with the French degrees, and offered
himself for the expedition. Maupertuis, in like manner, urged the
necessity of another expedition to measure a degree in the
neighborhood of the pole. The government received the applications
favorably, and these remarkable scientific missions were sent out at
the national expense.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note102-7"
href="#fnanchor102-7">102</a></span> Bailly, iii. 11.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page454">454</a></span> As soon as
the result of these measurements was known, there was no longer any
doubt as to the fact of the earth’s oblateness, and the question only
turned upon its quantity. Even before the return of the academicians,
the Cassinis and Lacaille had measured the French arc, and found
errors which subverted the former result, making the earth oblate to
the amount of <span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>168</sub></span>th of its diameter. The
expeditions to Peru and to Lapland had to struggle with difficulties
in the execution of their design, which make their narratives resemble
some romantic history of irregular warfare, rather than the monotonous
records of mere measurements. The equatorial degree employed the
observers not less than eight years. When they did return, and the
results were compared, their discrepancy, as to quantity, was
considerable. The comparison of the Peruvian and French arcs gave an
ellipticity of nearly <span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>314</sub></span>th, that of the Peruvian
and Swedish arcs gave <span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>213</sub></span>th for its value.</p>
<p>Newton had deduced from his theory, by reasonings of singular
ingenuity, an ellipticity of <span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>230</sub></span>th; but this result had
been obtained by supposing the earth homogeneous. If the earth be, as
we should most readily conjecture it to be, more dense in its interior
than at its exterior, its ellipticity will be less than that of a
homogeneous spheroid revolving in the same time. It does not appear
that Newton was aware of this; but Clairaut, in 1743, in his <i>Figure
of the Earth</i>, proved this and many other important results of the
attraction of the particles. Especially he established that, in
proportion as the fraction expressing the Ellipticity becomes smaller,
that expressing the Excess of the polar over the equatorial gravity
becomes larger; and he thus connected the measures of the ellipticity
obtained by means of Degrees, with those obtained by means of
Pendulums in different latitudes.</p>
<p>The altered rate of a Pendulum when carried towards the equator,
had been long ago observed by Richer and Halley, and had been quoted
by Newton as confirmatory of his theory. Pendulums were swung by the
academicians who measured the degrees, and confirmed the general
character of the results.</p>
<p>But having reached this point of the verification of the Newtonian
theory, any additional step becomes more difficult. Many excellent
measures, both of Degrees and of Pendulums, have been made since those
just mentioned. The results of the Arcs<a id="fnanchor103-7"
href="#note103-7"><span class="fnanchor">103</span></a> is an
Ellipticity of <span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>298</sub></span>th;&#8212;of the
Pendulums, an Ellipticity of about <span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>285</sub></span>th. This difference <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page455">455</a></span> is considerable, if
compared with the quantities themselves; but does not throw a shadow
of doubt on the truth of the theory. Indeed, the observations of each
kind exhibit irregularities which we may easily account for, by
ascribing them to the unknown distribution of the denser portions of
the earth; but which preclude the extreme of accuracy and certainty in
our result.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note103-7"
href="#fnanchor103-7">103</a></span> Airy, <i>Fig. Earth</i>, p.
230.</div>
<p>But the near agreement of the determination, from Degrees and from
Pendulums, is not the only coincidence by which the doctrine is
confirmed. We can trace the effect of the earth’s Oblateness in
certain minute apparent motions of the stars; for the attraction of
the sun and moon on the protuberant matter of the spheroid produces
the Precession of the equinoxes, and a Nutation of the earth’s axis.
The Precession had been known from the time of Hipparchus, and the
existence of Nutation was foreseen by Newton; but the quantity is so
small, that it required consummate skill and great labor in Bradley to
detect it by astronomical observation. Being, however, so detected,
its amount, as well as that of the Precession, gives us the means of
determining the amount of Terrestrial Ellipticity, by which the effect
is produced. But it is found, upon calculation, that we cannot obtain
this determination without assuming some law of density in the
homogeneous strata of which we suppose the earth to consist<a
id="fnanchor104-7" href="#note104-7"><span
class="fnanchor">104</span></a> The density will certainly increase in
proceeding towards the centre, and there is a simple and probable law
of this increase, which will give <span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>300</sub></span>th for the Ellipticity,
from the amount of two lunar Inequalities (one in latitude and one in
longitude), which are produced by the earth’s oblateness. Nearly the
same result follows from the quantity of Nutation. Thus every thing
tends to convince us that the ellipticity cannot deviate much from
this fraction.</p>

<p>[2d Ed.] [I ought not to omit another class of phenomena in which
the effects of the Earth’s Oblateness, acting according to the law of
universal gravitation, have manifested themselves;&#8212;I speak of
the Moon’s Motion, as affected by the Earth’s Ellipticity. In this
case, as in most others, observation anticipated theory. Mason had
inferred from lunar observations a certain Inequality in Longitude,
depending upon the distance of the Moon’s Node from the Equinox.
Doubts were entertained by astronomers whether this inequality really
existed; but Laplace showed that such an inequality would arise from
the oblate form of the earth; and that its magnitude might serve to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page456">456</a></span> determine the
amount of the oblateness. Laplace showed, at the same time, that along
with this Inequality in Longitude there must be an Inequality in
Latitude; and this assertion Burg confirmed by the discussion of
observations. The two Inequalities, as shown in the observations,
agree in assigning to the earth’s form an Ellipticity of <span

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 8.&#8212;<i>Confirmation of the Newtonian Theory by
Experiments on Attraction.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> attraction of all the parts of the
earth to one another was thus proved by experiments, in which the
whole mass of the earth is concerned. But attempts have also been made
to measure the attraction of smaller portions; as mountains, or
artificial masses. This is an experiment of great difficulty; for the
attraction of such masses must be compared with that of the earth, of
which it is a scarcely perceptible fraction; and, moreover, in the
case of mountains, the effect of the mountain will be modified or
disguised by unknown or unappreciable circumstances. In many of the
measurements of degrees, indications of the attraction of mountains
had been perceived; but at the suggestion of Maskelyne, the experiment
was carefully made, in 1774, upon the mountain Schehallien, in
Scotland, the mountain being mineralogically surveyed by Playfair. The
result obtained was, that the attraction of the mountain drew the
plumb-line about six seconds from the vertical; and it was deduced
from this, by Hutton’s calculations, that the density of the earth was
about once and four-fifths that of Schehallien, or four and a half
times that of water.</p>
<p>Cavendish, who had suggested many of the artifices in this
calculation, himself made the experiment in the other form, by using
leaden balls, about nine inches diameter. This observation was
conducted with an extreme degree of ingenuity and delicacy, which
could alone make it valuable; and the result agreed very nearly with
that of the Schehallien experiment, giving for the density of the
earth about five and one-third times that of water. Nearly the same
result was obtained by Carlini, in 1824, from observations of the
pendulum, made at a point of the Alps (the Hospice, on Mount Cenis) at
a considerable elevation above the average surface of the earth.

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 9.&#8212;<i>Application of the Newtonian Theory to
the Tides.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">We</span> come, finally, to that result, in which
most remains to be done for the verification of the general law of
attraction&#8212;the subject of the Tides. Yet, even here, the
verification is striking, as far as observations have been carried.
Newton’s theory explained, with singular felicity, all the prominent
circumstances of the tides then known;&#8212;the difference of spring
and neap tides; the effect of the moon’s and sun’s declination and
parallax; even the difference of morning and evening tides, and the
anomalous tides of particular places. About, and after, this time,
attempts were made both by the Royal Society of England, and by the
French Academy, to collect numerous observations  but these were not
followed up with sufficient perseverance. Perhaps, indeed, the theory
had not been at that time sufficiently developed  but the admirable
prize-essays of Euler, Bernoulli, and D’Alembert, in 1740, removed, in
a great measure, this deficiency. These dissertations supplied the
means of bringing this subject to the same test to which all the other
consequences of gravitation had been subjected;&#8212;namely, the
calculation of tables, and the continued and orderly comparison of
these with observation. Laplace has attempted this verification in
another way, by calculating the results of the theory (which he has
done with an extraordinary command of analysis), and then by comparing
these, in supposed critical cases, with the Brest observations. This
method has confirmed the theory as far as it could do so; but such a
process cannot supersede the necessity of applying the proper
criterion of truth in such cases, the construction and verification of
Tables. Bernoulli’s theory, on the other hand, has been used for the
construction of Tide-tables; but these have not been properly compared
with experiment; and when the comparison has been made, having been
executed for purposes of gain rather than of science, it has not been
published, and cannot be quoted as a verification of the theory.</p>
<p>Thus we have, as yet, no sufficient comparison of fact with theory,
for Laplace’s is far from a complete comparison. In this, as in other
parts of physical astronomy, our theory ought not only to agree with
observations selected and grouped in a particular manner, but with the
whole course of observation, and with every part of the phenomena. In
this, as in other cases, the true theory should be verified by its
giving us the best Tables; but Tide-tables were never, I believe,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page458">458</a></span> calculated upon
Laplace’s theory, and thus it was never fairly brought to the
test.</p>
<p>It is, perhaps, remarkable, considering all the experience which
astronomy had furnished, that men should have expected to reach the
completion of this branch of science by improving the mathematical
theory, without, at the same time, ascertaining the laws of the facts.
In all other departments of astronomy, as, for instance, in the cases
of the moon and the planets, the leading features of the phenomena had
been made out empirically, before the theory explained them. The
course which analogy would have recommended for the cultivation of our
knowledge of the tides, would have been, to ascertain, by an analysis
of long series of observations, the effect of changes in the time of
transit, parallax, and declination of the moon, and thus to obtain the
laws of phenomena  and then proceed to investigate the laws of
causation.</p>
<p>Though this was not the course followed by mathematical theorists,
it was really pursued by those who practically calculated Tide-tables;
and the application of knowledge to the useful purposes of life being
thus separated from the promotion of the theory, was naturally treated
as a gainful property, and preserved by secrecy. Art, in this
instance, having cast off her legitimate subordination to Science, or
rather, being deprived of the guidance which it was the duty of
Science to afford, resumed her ancient practices of exclusiveness and
mystery. Liverpool, London, and other places, had their Tide-tables,
constructed by undivulged methods, which methods, in some instances at
least, were handed down from father to son for several generations as
a family possession; and the publication of new Tables, accompanied by
a statement of the mode of calculation, was resented as an
infringement of the rights of property.</p>
<p>The mode in which these secret methods were invented, was that
which we have pointed out;&#8212;the analysis of a considerable series
of observations. Probably the best example of this was afforded by the
Liverpool Tide-tables. These were deduced by a clergyman named Holden,
from observations made at that port by a harbor-master of the name of
Hutchinson; who was led, by a love of such pursuits, to observe the
tides carefully for above twenty years, day and night. Holden’s
Tables, founded on four years of these observations, were remarkably
accurate.</p>
<p>At length men of science began to perceive that such calculations
were part of their business; and that they were called upon, as the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page459">459</a></span> guardians of
the established theory of the universe, to compare it in the greatest
possible detail with the facts. Mr. Lubbock was the first
mathematician who undertook the extensive labors which such a
conviction suggested. Finding that regular tide-observations had been
made at the London Docks from 1795, he took nineteen years of these
(purposely selecting the length of a cycle of the motions of the lunar
orbit), and caused them (in 1831) to be analyzed by Mr. Dessiou, an
expert calculator. He thus obtained<a id="fnanchor105-7"
href="#note105-7"><span class="fnanchor">105</span></a> Tables for the
effect of the Moon’s Declination, Parallax, and hour of Transit, on
the tides; and was enabled to produce Tide-tables founded upon the
data thus obtained. Some mistakes in these as first published
(mistakes unimportant as to the theoretical value of the work), served
to show the jealousy of the practical tide-table calculators, by the
acrimony with which the oversights were dwelt upon; but in a very few
years, the tables thus produced by an open and scientific process were
more exact than those which resulted from any of the secrets; and thus
practice was brought into its proper subordination to theory.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note105-7"
href="#fnanchor105-7">105</a></span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1831.
<i>British Almanac</i>, 1832.</div>
<p>The theory with which Mr. Lubbock was led to compare his results,
was the Equilibrium-theory of Daniel Bernoulli; and it was found that
this theory, with certain modifications of its elements, represented
the facts to a remarkable degree of precision. Mr. Lubbock pointed out
this agreement especially in the semi-mensual inequality of the times
of high water. The like agreement was afterwards (in 1833) shown by
Mr. Whewell<a id="fnanchor106-7" href="#note106-7"><span
class="fnanchor">106</span></a> to obtain still more accurately at
Liverpool, both for the Times and Heights; for by this time, nineteen
years of Hutchinson’s Liverpool Observations had also been discussed
by Mr. Lubbock. The other inequalities of the Times and Heights
(depending upon the Declination and Parallax of the Moon and Sun,)
were variously compared with the Equilibrium-theory by Mr. Lubbock and
Mr. Whewell; and the general result was, that the facts agreed with
the condition of equilibrium at a certain anterior time, but that this
anterior time was different for different phenomena. In like manner it
appeared to follow from these researches, that in order to explain the
facts, the mass of the moon must be supposed different in the
calculation at different places. A result in effect the same was
obtained by M. Daussy,<a id="fnanchor107-7" href="#note107-7"><span
class="fnanchor">107</span></a> an active French Hydrographer; for he
found that observations at various stations could not be reconciled
with the formulæ of Laplace’s <i>Mécanique</i> <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page460">460</a></span> <i>Céleste</i> (in
which the ratio of the heights of spring-tides and neap-tides was
computed on an assumed mass of the moon) without an alteration of
level which was, in fact, equivalent to an alteration of the moon’s
mass. Thus all things appeared to tend to show that the
Equilibrium-theory would give the <em>formulæ</em> for the
inequalities of the tides, but that the <em>magnitudes</em> which
enter into these formulæ must be sought from observation.</p>

<p>Whether this result is consistent with theory, is a question not so
much of Physical Astronomy as of Hydrodynamics, and has not yet been
solved. A Theory of the Tides which should include in its conditions
the phenomena of Derivative Tides, and of their combinations, will
probably require all the resources of the mathematical
mechanician.</p>
<p>As a contribution of empirical materials to the treatment of this
hydrodynamical problem, it may be allowable to mention here Mr.
Whewell’s attempts to trace the progress of the tide into all the seas
of the globe, by drawing on maps of the ocean what he calls <i>Cotidal
Lines</i>;&#8212;lines marking the contemporaneous position of the
various points of the great wave which carries high water from shore
to shore.<a id="fnanchor108-7" href="#note108-7"><span
class="fnanchor">108</span></a> This is necessarily a task of labor
and difficulty, since it requires us to know the time of high water on
the same day in every part of the world; but in proportion as it is
completed, it supplies steps between our general view of the movements

Approximation to a Map of Cotidal Lines. <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1833,
1836.</div>
<p>Looking at this subject by the light which the example of the
history of astronomy affords, we may venture to repeat, that it will
never have justice done it till it is treated as other parts of
astronomy are treated; that is, till Tables of all the phenomena which
can be observed, are calculated by means of the best knowledge which
we at present possess, and till these tables are constantly improved
by a comparison of the predicted with the observed fact. A set of
Tide-observations and Tide-ephemerides of this kind, would soon give
to this subject that precision which marks the other parts of
astronomy; and would leave an assemblage of unexplained <i>residual
phenomena</i>, in which a careful research might find the materials of
other truths as yet unsuspected.</p>
<p>[2d Ed.] [That there would be, in the tidal movements of the ocean,
inequalities of the heights and times of high and low water <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page461">461</a></span>
<em>corresponding</em> to those which the equilibrium theory gives,
could be considered only as a conjecture, till the comparison with
observation was made. It was, however, a natural conjecture; since the
waters of the ocean are at every moment <em>tending</em> to acquire
the form assumed in the equilibrium theory: and it may be considered
likely that the causes which prevent their assuming this form produce
an effect nearly constant for each place. Whatever be thought of this
reasoning, the conjecture is confirmed by observation with curious
exactness. The laws of a great number of the tidal
phenomena&#8212;namely, of the Semi-mensual Inequality of the Heights,
of the Semi-mensual Inequality of the Times, of the Diurnal
Inequality, of the effect of the Moon’s Declination, of the effect of
the Moon’s Parallax&#8212;are represented very closely by formulæ
derived from the equilibrium theory. The hydrodynamical mode of
treating the subject has not added any thing to the knowledge of the
laws of the phenomena to which the other view had conducted us.</p>
<p>We may add, that Laplace’s assumption, that in the moving fluid the
motions must have a <em>periodicity</em> corresponding to that of the
forces, is also a conjecture. And though this conjecture may, in some
cases of the problem, be verified, by substituting the resulting
expressions in the equations of motion, this cannot be done in the
actual case, where the revolving motion of the ocean is prevented by
the intrusion of tracts of land running nearly from pole to pole.</p>
<p>Yet in Mr. Airy’s Treatise <i>On Tides and Waves</i> (in the
<i>Encyclopædia Metropolitana</i>) much has been done to bring the
hydrodynamical theory of oceanic tides into agreement with
observation. In this admirable work, Mr. Airy has, by peculiar
artifices, solved problems which come so near the actual cases that
they may represent them. He has, in this way, deduced the laws of the
semi-diurnal and the diurnal tide, and the other features of the tides
which the equilibrium theory in some degree imitates; but he has also,
taking into account the effect of friction, shown that the actual tide
may be represented as the tide of an earlier epoch;&#8212;that the
relative mass of the moon and sun, as inferred from the tides, would
depend upon the depth of the ocean (Art. 455);&#8212;with many other
results remarkably explaining the observed phenomena. He has also
shown that the relation of the cotidal lines to the tide waves really
propagated is, in complex cases, very obscure, because different waves
of different magnitudes, travelling in different directions, may
coexist, and the cotidal line is the compound result of all these.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page462">462</a></span></p>
<p>With reference to the <i>Maps of Cotidal Lines</i>, mentioned in
the text, I may add, that we are as yet destitute of observations
which should supply the means of drawing such lines on a large scale
in the Pacific Ocean. Admiral Lütke has however supplied us with some
valuable materials and remarks on this subject in his <i>Notice sur
les Marées Périodiques dans le grand Océan Boréal et dans la Mer
Glaciale</i>; and has drawn them, apparently on sufficient data, in
the White Sea.] ~Additional material in the <a href="#tides">3rd

Theory.</span></h3>
<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Tables of Astronomical
Refraction.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">WE</span> have travelled over an
immense field of astronomical and mathematical labor in the last few
pages, and have yet, at the end of every step, still found ourselves
under the jurisdiction of the Newtonian laws. We are reminded of the
universal monarchies, where a man could not escape from the empire
without quitting the world. We have now to notice some other
discoveries, in which this reference to the law of universal
gravitation is less immediate and obvious; I mean the astronomical
discoveries respecting Light.</p>
<p>The general truths to which the establishment of the true laws of
Atmospheric Refraction led astronomers, were the law of Deflection of
the rays of light, which applies to all refractions, and the real
structure and size of the Atmosphere, so far as it became known. The
great discoveries of Römer and Bradley, namely, the Velocity of Light,
the Aberration of Light, and the Nutation of the earth’s axis, gave a
new distinctness to the conceptions of the propagation of light in the
minds of philosophers, and confirmed the doctrines of Copernicus,
Kepler, and Newton, respecting the motions which belong to the
earth.</p>
<p>The true laws of Atmospheric Refraction were slowly discovered.
Tycho attributed the apparent displacement of the heavenly bodies to
the low and gross part of the atmosphere only, and hence made it cease
at a point half-way to the zenith; but Kepler rightly extended it to
the zenith itself. Dominic Cassini endeavored to discover the law of
this correction by observation, and gave his result in the form <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page463">463</a></span> which, as we have
said, sound science prescribes, a Table to be habitually used for all
observations. But great difficulties at this time embarrassed this
investigation, for the parallaxes of the sun and of the planets were
unknown, and very diverse values had been assigned them by different
astronomers. To remove some of these difficulties, Richer, in 1762,
went to observe at the equator; and on his return, Cassini was able to
confirm and amend his former estimations of parallax and refraction.
But there were still difficulties. According to La Hire, though the
phenomena of twilight give an altitude of 34,000 toises to the
atmosphere,<a id="fnanchor109-7" href="#note109-7"><span
class="fnanchor">109</span></a> those of refraction make it only 2000.
John Cassini undertook to support and improve the calculations of his
father Dominic, and took the true supposition, that the light follows
a curvilinear path through the air. The Royal Society of London had
already ascertained experimentally the refractive power of air.<a
id="fnanchor110-7" href="#note110-7"><span
class="fnanchor">110</span></a> Newton calculated a Table of
Refractions, which was published under Halley’s name in the <span
class="correction" title="emended from
Philosphical"><i>Philosophical</i></span> <i>Transactions</i> for
1721, without any indication of the method by which it was
constructed. But M. Biot has recently shown,<a id="fnanchor111-7"
href="#note111-7"><span class="fnanchor">111</span></a> by means of
the published correspondence of Flamsteed, that Newton had solved the
problem in a manner nearly corresponding to the most improved methods
of modern analysis.</p>

<p>Dominic Cassini and Picard proved,<a id="fnanchor112-7"
href="#note112-7"><span class="fnanchor">112</span></a> Le Monnier in
1738 confirmed more fully, the fact that the variations of the
Thermometer affect the Refraction. Mayer, taking into account both
these changes, and the changes indicated by the Barometer, formed a
theory, which Lacaille, with immense labor, applied to the
construction of a Table of Refractions from observation. But Bradley’s
Table (published in 1763 by Maskelyne) was more commonly adopted in
England; and his formula, originally obtained empirically, has been
shown by Young to result from the most probable suppositions we can
make respecting the atmosphere. Bessel’s Refraction Tables are now
considered the best of those which have appeared.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Discovery of the Velocity of
Light.&#8212;Römer.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> astronomical history of Refraction is
not marked by any great discoveries, and was, for the most part, a
work of labor only. The progress of the other portions of our
knowledge respecting light is <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page464">464</a></span> more striking. In 1676, a great number
of observations of eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites were accumulated,
and could be compared with Cassini’s Tables. Römer, a Danish
astronomer, whom Picard had brought to Paris, perceived that these
eclipses happened constantly later than the calculated time at one
season of the year, and earlier at another season;&#8212;a difference
for which astronomy could offer no account. The error was the same for
all the satellites; if it had depended on a defect in the Tables of
Jupiter, it might have affected all, but the effect would have had a
reference to the velocities of the satellites. The cause, then, was
something extraneous to Jupiter. Römer had the happy thought of
comparing the error with the earth’s distance from Jupiter, and it was
found that the eclipses happened later in proportion as Jupiter was
further off.<a id="fnanchor113-7" href="#note113-7"><span
class="fnanchor">113</span></a> Thus we see the eclipse later, as it
is more remote; and thus light, the messenger which brings us
intelligence of the occurrence, travels over its course in a
measurable time. By this evidence, light appeared to take about eleven
minutes in describing the diameter of the earth’s orbit.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note113-7"
href="#fnanchor113-7">113</a></span> Bailly, ii. 17.</div>
<p>This discovery, like so many others, once made, appears easy and
inevitable; yet Dominic Cassini had entertained the idea for a
moment,<a id="fnanchor114-7" href="#note114-7"><span
class="fnanchor">114</span></a> and had rejected it; and Fontenelle
had congratulated himself publicly on having narrowly escaped this
seductive error. The objections to the admission of the truth arose
principally from the inaccuracy of observation, and from the
persuasion that the motions of the satellites were circular and
uniform. Their irregularities disguised the fact in question. As these
irregularities became clearly known, Römer’s discovery was finally
established, and the “Equation of Light” took its place in the
Tables.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Discovery of
Aberration.&#8212;Bradley.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">Improvements</span> in instruments, and in the art
of observing, were requisite for making the next great step in tracing
the effect of the laws of light. It appears clear, on consideration,
that since light and the spectator on the earth are both in motion,
the apparent direction of an object will be determined by the
composition of these motions. But yet the effect of this composition
of motions was (as is usual in such cases) traced as a fact in
observation, before it was clearly seen as a consequence of reasoning.
This fact, the Aberration of Light, the greatest astronomical
discovery of the eighteenth century, belongs to Bradley, <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page465">465</a></span> who was then
Professor of Astronomy at Oxford, and afterwards Astronomer Royal at
Greenwich. Molyneux and Bradley, in 1725, began a series of
observations for the purpose of ascertaining, by observations near the
zenith, the existence of an annual parallax of the fixed stars, which
Hooke had hoped to detect, and Flamsteed thought he had discovered.
Bradley<a id="fnanchor115-7" href="#note115-7"><span
class="fnanchor">115</span></a> soon found that the star observed by
him had a minute apparent motion different from that which the annual
parallax would produce. He thought of a nutation of the earth’s axis
as a mode of accounting for this; but found, by comparison of a star
on the other side of the pole, that this explanation would not apply.
Bradley and Molyneux then considered for a moment an annual alteration
of figure in the earth’s atmosphere, such as might affect the
refractions, but this hypothesis was soon rejected.<a
id="fnanchor116-7" href="#note116-7"><span
class="fnanchor">116</span></a> In 1727, Bradley resumed his
observations, with a new instrument, at Wanstead, and obtained
empirical rules for the changes of declination of different stars. At
last, accident turned his thoughts to the direction in which he was to
find the cause of the variations which he had discovered. Being in a
boat on the Thames, he observed that the vane on the top of the mast
gave a different apparent direction to the wind, as the boat sailed
one way or the other. Here was an image of his case: the boat
represented the earth moving in different directions at different
seasons, and the wind represented the light of a star. He had now to
trace the consequences of this idea; he found that it led to the
empirical rules, which he had already discovered, and, in 1729, he
gave his discovery to the Royal Society. His paper is a very happy
narrative of his labors and his thoughts. His theory was so sound that
no astronomer ever contested it; and his observations were so
accurate, that the quantity which he assigned as the greatest amount
of the change (one nineteenth of a degree) has hardly been corrected
by more recent astronomers. It must be noticed, however, that he
considered the effects in declination only; the effects in right
ascension required a different mode of observation, and a consummate
goodness in the machinery of clocks, which at that time was hardly
attained.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 4.&#8212;<i>Discovery of Nutation.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">When</span> Bradley went to Greenwich as
Astronomer Royal, he continued with perseverance observations of the
same kind as those by which he had detected Aberration. The result of
these was another <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page466">466</a></span> discovery; namely, that very Nutation
which he had formerly rejected. This may appear strange, but it is
easily explained. The aberration is an annual change, and is detected
by observing a star at different seasons of the year: the Nutation is
a change of which the cycle is eighteen years; and which, therefore,
though it does not much change the place of a star in one year, is
discoverable in the alterations of several successive years. A very
few years’ observations showed Bradley the effect of this change;<a
id="fnanchor117-7" href="#note117-7"><span
class="fnanchor">117</span></a> and long before the half cycle of nine
years had elapsed, he had connected it in his mind with the true
cause, the motion of the moon’s nodes. Machin was then Secretary to
the Royal Society,<a id="fnanchor118-7" href="#note118-7"><span
class="fnanchor">118</span></a> and was “employed in considering the
theory of gravity, and its consequences with regard to the celestial
motions:” to him Bradley communicated his conjectures; from him he
soon received a Table containing the results of his calculations; and
the law was found to be the same in the Table and in observation,
though the quantities were somewhat different. It appeared by both,
that the earth’s pole, besides the motion which the precession of the
equinoxes gives it, moves, in eighteen years, through a small
circle;&#8212;or rather, as was afterwards found by Bradley, an
ellipse, of which the axes are nineteen and fourteen seconds.<a

href="#fnanchor119-7">119</a></span> Ib. lxvi.</div>
<p>For the rigorous establishment of the mechanical theory of that
effect of the moon’s attraction from which the phenomena of Nutation
flow, Bradley rightly and prudently invited the assistance of the
great mathematicians of his time. D’Alembert, Thomas Simpson, Euler,
and others, answered this call, and the result was, as we have already
said in the last chapter (<a href="#b7-4-7">Sect. 7</a>), that this
investigation added another to the recondite and profound evidences of
the doctrine of universal gravitation.</p>
<p>It has been said<a id="fnanchor120-7" href="#note120-7"><span
class="fnanchor">120</span></a> that Bradley’s discoveries “assure him
the most distinguished place among astronomers after Hipparchus and
Kepler.” If his discoveries had been made before Newton’s, there could
have been no hesitation as to placing him on a level with those great
men. The existence of such suggestions as the Newtonian theory offered
on all astronomical subjects, may perhaps dim, in our eyes, the
brilliance of Bradley’s achievements; but this circumstance cannot
place any other person above the author of such discoveries, and
therefore we may consider Delambre’s adjudication of precedence as
well warranted, and deserving to be permanent.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 5.&#8212;<i>Discovery of the Laws of Double
Stars.&#8212;The two Herschels.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">No</span> truth, then, can be more certainly
established, than that the law of gravitation prevails to the very
boundaries of the solar system. But does it hold good further? Do the
fixed stars also obey this universal sway? The idea, the question, is
an obvious one&#8212;but where are we to find the means of submitting
it to the test of observation?</p>
<p>If the Stars were each insulated from the rest, as our Sun appears
to be from them, we should have been quite unable to answer this
inquiry. But among the stars, there are some which are called
<i>Double Stars</i>, and which consist of two stars, so near to each
other that the telescope alone can separate them. The elder Herschel
diligently observed and measured the relative positions of the two
stars in such pairs; and as has so often happened in astronomical
history, pursuing one object he fell in with another. Supposing such
pairs to be really unconnected, he wished to learn, from their
phenomena, something respecting the annual parallax of the earth’s
orbit. But in the course of twenty years’ observations he made the
discovery (in 1803) that some of these couples were turning round each
other with various angular velocities. These revolutions were for the
most part so slow that he was obliged to leave their complete
determination as an inheritance to the next generation. His son was
not careless of the bequest, and after having added an enormous mass
of observations to those of his father, he applied himself to
determine the laws of these revolutions. A problem so obvious and so
tempting was attacked also by others, as Savary and Encke, in 1830 and
1832, with the resources of analysis. But a problem in which the data
are so minute and inevitably imperfect, required the mathematician to
employ much judgment, as well as skill in using and combining these
data; and Sir John Herschel, by employing positions only of the line
joining the pair of stars (which can be observed with comparative
exactness), to the exclusion of their distances (which cannot be
measured with much correctness), and by inventing a method which
depended upon the whole body of observations, and not upon selected
ones only, for the determination of the motion, has made his
investigations by far the most satisfactory of those which have
appeared. The result is, that it has been rendered very probable, that
in several of the double stars the two stars describe ellipses about
each other; and therefore that here also, at an <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page468">468</a></span> immeasurable distance
from our system, the law of attraction according to the inverse square
of the distance, prevails. And, according to the practice of
astronomers when a law has been established, Tables have been
calculated for the future motions; and we have Ephemerides of the
revolutions of suns round each other, in a region so remote, that the
whole circle of our earth’s orbit, if placed there, would be
imperceptible by our strongest telescopes. The permanent comparison of
the observed with the predicted motions, continued for more than one
revolution, is the severe and decisive test of the truth of the
theory; and the result of this test astronomers are now awaiting.</p>
<p>[2d Ed.] [In calculating the orbits of revolving systems of double
stars, there is a peculiar difficulty, arising from the plane of the
orbit being in a position unknown, but probably oblique, to the visual
ray. Hence it comes to pass that even if the orbit be an ellipse
described about the focus by the laws of planetary motion, it will
appear otherwise; and the true orbit will have to be deduced from the
apparent one.</p>
<p>With regard to a difficulty which has been mentioned, that the two
stars, if they are governed by gravity, will not revolve the one about
the other, but both about their common centre of gravity;&#8212;this
circumstance adds little difficulty to the problem. Newton has shown
(<i>Princip.</i> lib. i. Prop. 61) in the <i>problem of two
bodies</i>, the relation between the relative orbits and the orbit
about the common centre of gravity.</p>
<p><em>How many of the apparently double stars have orbitual
motions?</em> Sir John Herschel in 1833 gave, in his <i>Astronomy</i>
(Art. 606), a list of nine stars, with periods extending from 43 years
(η Coronæ) to 1200 years (γ Leonis), which he presented as the chief
results then obtained in this department. In his work on Double Stars,
the fruit of his labors in both hemispheres, which the astronomical
world are looking for with eager expectation, he will, I believe, have
a few more to add to these.</p>
<p><em>Is it well established that such double stars attract each
other according to the law of the inverse square of the distance?</em>
The answer to this question must be determined by ascertaining whether
the above cases are regulated by the laws of elliptical motion. This
is a matter which it must require a long course of careful observation
to determine in such a number of cases as to prove the universality of
the rule. Perhaps the minds of astronomers are still in suspense upon
the subject. When Sir John Herschel’s work shall appear, it will
probably <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page469">469</a></span> be
found that with regard to some of these stars, and γ Virginis in
particular, the conformity of the observations with the laws of
elliptical motion amounts to a degree of exactness which must give
astronomers a strong conviction of the truth of the law. For since Sir
W. Herschel’s first measures in 1781, the arc described by one star
about the other is above 305 degrees; and during this period the
angular annual motion has been very various, passing through all
gradations from about 20 minutes to 80 degrees. Yet in the whole of
this change, the two curves constructed, the one from the
observations, the other from the elliptical elements, for the purpose
of comparison, having a total ordinate of 305 parts, do not, in any
part of their course, deviate from each other so much as <em>two</em>
such parts.]</p>
<p>The verification of Newton’s discoveries was sufficient employment
for the last century; the first step in the extension of them belongs
to this century. We cannot at present foresee the magnitude of this
task, but every one must feel that the law of gravitation, before
verified in all the particles of our own system, and now probably
extended to the all but infinite distance of the fixed stars, presses
upon our minds with a strong claim to be accepted as a universal law
of the whole material creation.</p>
<p>Thus, in this and the preceding chapter, I have given a brief
sketch of the history of the verification and extension of Newton’s
great discovery. By the mass of labor and of skill which this head of
our subject includes, we may judge of the magnitude of the advance in
our knowledge which that discovery made. A wonderful amount of talent
and industry have been requisite for this purpose; but with these,
external means have co-operated. Wealth, authority, mechanical skill,
the division of labor, the power of associations and of governments,
have been largely and worthily applied in bringing astronomy to its
present high and flourishing condition. We must consider briefly what
has thus been done. ~Additional material in the <a href="#double">3rd

<span class="sc">The Instruments and Aids of Astronomy during the
Newtonian Period.</span></h3>
<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Instruments.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">SOME</span> instruments or other were
employed at all periods of astronomical observation. But it was only
when observation had attained a considerable degree of delicacy, that
the exact construction of instruments became an object of serious
care. Gradually, as the possibility and the value of increased
exactness became manifest, it was seen that every thing which could
improve the astronomer’s instruments was of high importance to him.
And hence in some cases a vast increase of size and of expense was
introduced; in other cases new combinations, or the result of
improvements in other sciences, were brought into play. Extensive
knowledge, intense thought, and great ingenuity, were requisite in the
astronomical instrument maker. Instead of ranking with artisans, he
became a man of science, sharing the honor and dignity of the
astronomer himself.</p>
<p>1. <i>Measure of Angles.</i>&#8212;Tycho Brahe was the first
astronomer who acted upon a due appreciation of the importance of good
instruments. The collection of such at Uraniburg was by far the finest
which had ever existed. He endeavored to give steadiness to the frame,
and accuracy to the divisions of his instruments. His Mural Quadrant
was well adapted for this purpose; its radius was five cubits: it is
clear, that as we enlarge the instrument we are enabled to measure
smaller arcs. On this principle many large <i>gnomons</i> were
erected. Cassini’s celebrated one in the church of St. Petronius at
Bologna, was eighty-three feet (French) high. But this mode of
obtaining accuracy was soon abandoned for better methods. Three great
improvements were introduced about the same time. The application of
the Micrometer to the telescope, by Huyghens, Malvasia, and Auzout;
the application of the Telescope to the astronomical quadrant; and the
fixation of the centre of its field by a Cross of fine wires placed in
the focus by Gascoigne, and afterwards by Picard. We may judge how
great was the improvement which these contrivances introduced into the
art of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page471">471</a></span>
observing, by finding that Hevelius refused to adopt them because they
would make all the old observations of no value. He had spent a
laborious and active life in the exercise of the old methods, and
could not bear to think that all the treasures which he had
accumulated had lost their worth by the discovery of a new mine of
richer ore.</p>
<p>[2d Ed.] [Littrow, in his <i>Die Wunder des Himmels</i>, Ed. 2, pp.
684, 685, says that Gascoigne invented and used the telescope with
wires in the common focus of the lenses in 1640. He refers to <i>Phil.
Trans.</i> xxx. 603. Picard reinvented this arrangement in 1667. I
have  <a href="#v1page395"> already</a> spoken of Gascoigne as the
inventor of the micrometer.</p>
<p>Römer (already mentioned, <a href="#v1page464">p. 464</a>) brought
into use the Transit Instrument, and the employment of complete
Circles, instead of the Quadrants used till then; and by these means
gave to practical astronomy a new form, of which the full value was
not discovered till long afterwards.<span class="correction"
title="omitted in this edition">]</span></p>
<p>The apparent place of the object in the instrument being so
precisely determined by the new methods, the exact Division of the arc
into degrees and their subdivisions became a matter of great
consequence. A series of artists, principally English, have acquired
distinguished places in the lists of scientific fame by their
performances in this way; and from that period, particular instruments
have possessed historical interest and individual reputation. Graham
was one of the first of these artists. He executed a great Mural Arc
for Halley at Greenwich; for Bradley he constructed the Sector which
detected aberration. He also made the Sector which the French
academicians carried to Lapland; and probably the goodness of this
instrument, compared with the imperfection of those which were sent to
Peru, was one main cause of the great difference of duration in the
two series of observations. Bird, somewhat later<a id="fnanchor121-7"
href="#note121-7"><span class="fnanchor">121</span></a> (about 1750),
divided several Quadrants for public observatories. His method of
dividing was considered so perfect, that the knowledge of it was
purchased by the English government, and published in 1767. Ramsden
was equally celebrated. The error of one of his best Quadrants (that
at Padua) is said to be never greater than two seconds. But at a later
period, Ramsden constructed Mural Circles only, holding this to be a
kind of instrument far superior to the quadrant. He made one of five
feet diameter, in 1788, for M. Piazzi at Palermo; and one of eight
feet for the observatory of Dublin. Troughton, a worthy successor of
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page472">472</a></span> artists we
have mentioned, has invented a method of dividing the circle still
superior to the former ones; indeed, one which is theoretically
perfect, and practically capable of consummate accuracy. In this way,
circles have been constructed for Greenwich, Armagh, Cambridge, and
many other places; and probably this method, carefully applied, offers
to the astronomer as much exactness as his other implements allow him
to receive; but the slightest casualty happening to such an
instrument, after it has been constructed, or any doubt whether the
method of graduation has been rightly applied, makes it unfit for the
jealous scrupulosity of modern astronomy.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note121-7"
href="#fnanchor121-7">121</a></span> Mont. iv. 337.</div>
<p>The English artists sought to attain accurate measurements by
continued bisection and other aliquot subdivision of the limb of their
circle; but Mayer proposed to obtain this end otherwise, by
<em>repeating</em> the measure on different parts of the circumference
till the error of the division becomes unimportant, instead of
attempting to divide an instrument without error. This invention of
the Repeating Circle was zealously adopted by the French, and the
relative superiority of the rival methods is still a matter of
difference of opinion.</p>
<p>[2d Ed.] [In the series of these great astronomical mechanists, we
must also reckon George Reichenbach. He was born Aug. 24, 1772, at
Durlach; became Lieutenant of Artillery in the Bavarian service in
1794; (Salinenrath) Commissioner of Salt-works in 1811; and in 1820,
First Commissioner of Water-works and Roads. He became, with
Fraunhofer, the ornament of the mechanical and optical Institute
erected in 1805 at Benedictbeuern by Utzschneider; and his
astronomical instruments, meridian circles, transit instruments,
equatorials, heliometers, make an epoch in Observing Astronomy. His
contrivances in the Salt-works at Berchtesgaden and Reichenhall, in
the Arms Manufactory at Amberg, and in the works for boring cannon at
Vienna, are enduring monuments of his rare mechanical talent. He died
May 21, 1826, at Munich.]</p>
<p id="clocks">2. <i>Clocks.</i>&#8212;The improvements in the
measures of space require corresponding improvements in the measure of
time. The beginning of any thing which we can call accuracy, in this
subject, was the application of the Pendulum to clocks, by Huyghens,
in 1656. That the successive oscillations of a pendulum occupy equal
times, had been noticed by Galileo; but in order to take advantage of
this property, the pendulum must be connected with machinery by which
its motion is kept from languishing, and by which the number of its
swings is recorded. By inventing such machinery, Huyghens at once
obtained <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page473">473</a></span> a
measure of time more accurate than the sun itself. Hence astronomers
were soon led to obtain the right ascension of a star, not directly,
by measuring a Distance in the heavens, but indirectly, by observing
the Moment of its Transit. This observation is now made with a degree
of accuracy which might, at first sight, appear beyond the limits of
human sense, being noted to a <i>tenth of a second of time</i>: but we
may explain this, by remarking that though the number of the second at
which the transit happens is given by the clock, and is reckoned
according to the course of time, the subdivision of the second of time
into smaller fractions is performed by the eye,&#8212;by seeing the
space described by the heavenly body in a whole second, and hence
estimating a smaller time, according to the space which its
description occupies.</p>
<p>But in order to make clocks so accurate as to justify this degree
of precision, their construction was improved by various persons in
succession. Picard soon found that Huyghens’ clocks were affected in
their going by temperature, for heat caused expansion of the metallic
pendulum. This cause of error was remedied by combining different
metals, as iron and copper, which expand in a different degree, in
such a way that their effects compensate each other. Graham afterwards
used quicksilver for the same purpose. The <i>Escapement</i> too
(which connects the force which impels the clock with the pendulum
which regulates it), and other parts of the machinery, had the most
refined mechanical skill and ingenuity of the best artists constantly
bestowed upon then. The astronomer of the present day, constantly
testing the going of such a clock by the motions of the fixed stars,
has a scale of time as stable and as minutely exact as the scales on
which he measures distance.</p>
<p>The construction of good Watches, that is, portable or marine
clocks, was important on another account, namely, because they might
be used in determining the longitude of places. Hence the improvement
of this little machine became an object of national interest, and was
included in the reward of 20,000<i>l.</i>, which we have already <a
href="#v1page434">noticed</a> as offered by the English parliament for
the discovery of the longitude. Harrison,<a id="fnanchor122-7"
href="#note122-7"><span class="fnanchor">122</span></a> originally a
carpenter, turned his mind to this subject with success. After thirty
years of labor, in which he was encouraged by many eminent persons, he
produced, in 1758, a time-keeper, which was sent on a voyage to
Jamaica for trial. After 161 days, the error <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page474">474</a></span> of the watch was only one minute five
seconds, and the artist received from the nation 5000<i>l.</i> At a
later period,<a id="fnanchor123-7" href="#note123-7"><span
class="fnanchor">123</span></a> at the age of seventy-five years,
after a life devoted to this object, having still further satisfied
the commissioners, he received, in 1765, 10,000<i>l.</i>, at the same
time that Euler and the heirs of Mayer received each 3000<i>l.</i> for
the lunar tables which they had constructed.</p>

<p>The two methods of finding the longitude, by Chronometers and by
Lunar Observations, have solved the problem for all practical
purposes; but the latter could not have been employed at sea without
the aid of that invaluable instrument, the Sextant, in which the
distance of two objects is observed, by bringing one to coincide
apparently with the reflected image of the other. This instrument was
invented by Hadley, in 1731. Though the problem of finding the
longitude be, in fact, one of geography rather than astronomy, it is
an application of astronomical science which has so materially
affected the progress of our knowledge, that it deserves the notice we
have bestowed upon it.</p>
<p>3. <i>Telescopes.</i>&#8212;We have spoken of the application of
the telescope to astronomical measurements, but not of the improvement
of the telescope itself. If we endeavor to augment the optical power
of this instrument, we run, according to the path we take, into
various inconveniences;&#8212;distortion, confusion, want of light, or
colored images. Distortion and confusion are produced, if we increase
the magnifying power, retaining the length and the aperture of the
object-glass. If we diminish the aperture we suffer from loss of
light. What remains then is to increase the focal length. This was
done to an extraordinary extent, in telescopes constructed in the
beginning of the last century. Huyghens, in his first attempts, made
them 22 feet long;<a id="fnanchor124-7" href="#note124-7"><span
class="fnanchor">124</span></a> afterwards, Campani, by order of Louis
the Fourteenth, made them of 86, 100, and 136 feet. Huyghens, by new
exertions, made a telescope 210 feet long. Auzout and Hartsoecker are
said to have gone much further, and to have succeeded in making an
object-glass of 600 feet focus. But even such telescopes as those of
Campani are almost unmanageable: in that of Huyghens, the object-glass
was placed on a pole, and the observer was placed at the focus with an
eye-glass.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note124-7"
href="#fnanchor124-7">124</a></span> Bailly, ii. 253.</div>
<p>The most serious objection to the increase of the aperture of
object-glasses, was the coloration of the image produced, in
consequence of the unequal refrangibility of differently colored rays.
Newton, who discovered the principle of this defect in lenses, had
maintained that <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page475">475</a></span>
the evil was irremediable, and that a compound lens could no more
refract without producing color, than a single lens could. Euler and
Klingenstierna doubted the exactness of Newton’s proposition; and, in
1755, Dollond disproved it by experiment. This discovery pointed out a
method of making object-glasses which should give no
color;&#8212;which should be <i>achromatic</i>. For this purpose
Dollond fabricated various kinds of glass (flint and crown glass); and
Clairaut and D’Alembert calculated formulæ. Dollond and his son<a
id="fnanchor125-7" href="#note125-7"><span
class="fnanchor">125</span></a> succeeded in constructing telescopes
of three feet long (with a triple object-glass) which produced an
effect as great as those of forty-five feet on the ancient principles.
At first it was conceived that these discoveries opened the way to a
vast extension of the astronomer’s power of vision; but it was found
that the most material improvement was the compendious size of the new
instruments; for, in increasing the dimensions, the optician was
stopped by the impossibility of obtaining lenses of flint-glass of
very large dimensions. And this branch of art remained long
stationary; but, after a time, its epoch of advance again arrived. In
the present century, Fraunhofer, at Munich, with the help of Guinand
and the pecuniary support of Utzschneider, succeeded in forming lenses
of flint-glass of a magnitude till then unheard of. Achromatic
object-glasses, of a foot in diameter, and twenty feet focal length,
are now no longer impossible; although in such attempts the artist
cannot reckon on certain success.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note125-7"
href="#fnanchor125-7">125</a></span> Bailly, iii. 118.</div>
<p>[2d Ed.] [Joseph Fraunhofer was born March 6, 1787, at Straubing in
Bavaria, the son of a poor glazier. He was in his earlier years
employed in his father’s trade, so that he was not able to attend
school, and remained ignorant of writing and arithmetic till his
fourteenth year. At a later period he was assisted by Utzschneider,
and tried rapidly to recover his lost ground. In the year 1806 he
entered the establishment of Utzschneider as an optician. In this
establishment (transferred from Benedictbeuern to Munich in 1819) he
soon came to be the greatest Optician of Germany. His excellent
telescopes and microscopes are known throughout Europe. His greatest
telescope, that in the Observatory at Dorpat, has an object-glass of 9
inches diameter, and a focal length of 13⅓ feet. His written
productions are to be found in the <i>Memoirs</i> of the Bavarian
Academy, in Gilbert’s <i>Annalen der Physik</i>, and in Schumacher’s
<i>Astronomische Nachrichten</i>. He died the 7th of June, 1826.]
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page476">476</a></span></p>
<p>Such telescopes might be expected to add something to our knowledge
of the heavens, if they had not been anticipated by reflectors of an
equal or greater scale. James Gregory had invented, and Newton had
more efficaciously introduced, reflecting telescopes. But these were
not used with any peculiar effect, till the elder Herschel made them
his especial study. His skill and perseverance in grinding specula,
and in contriving the best apparatus for their use, were rewarded by a
number of curious and striking discoveries, among which, as we have <a
href="#b7-4-5">already</a> related, was the discovery of a new planet
beyond Saturn. In 1789, Herschel surpassed all his former attempts, by
bringing into action a reflecting telescope of forty feet length, with
a speculum of four feet in diameter. The first application of this
magnificent instrument showed a new satellite (the sixth) of Saturn.
He and his son have, with reflectors of twenty feet, made a complete
survey of the heavens, so far as they are visible in this country; and
the latter is now in a distant region completing this survey, by
adding to it the other hemisphere.</p>
<p>In speaking of the improvements of telescopes we ought to notice,
that they have been pursued in the eye-glasses as well as in the
object-glasses. Instead of the single lens, Huyghens substituted an
eye-piece of two lenses, which, though introduced for another purpose,
attained the object of destroying color.<a id="fnanchor126-7"
href="#note126-7"><span class="fnanchor">126</span></a> Ramsden’s
eye-piece is one fit to be used with a micrometer, and others of more
complex construction have been used for various purposes. ~Additional

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Observatories.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">Astronomy</span>, which is thus benefited by the
erection of large and stable instruments, requires also the
establishment of permanent Observatories, supplied with funds for
their support, and for that of the observers. Such observatories have
existed at all periods of the history of the science; but from the
commencement of the period which we are now reviewing, they multiplied
to such an extent that we cannot even enumerate them. Yet we must
undoubtedly look upon such establishments, and the labors of which
they have been the scene, as important and essential parts of the
history of the progress of astronomy. Some of the most distinguished
of the observatories of modern times we may mention. The first of
these were that of Tycho Brahe <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page477">477</a></span> at Uraniburg, and that of the Landgrave
of Hesse Cassel, at Cassel, where Rothman and Byrgius observed. But by
far the most important observations, at least since those of Tycho,
which were the basis of the discoveries of Kepler and Newton, have
been made at Paris and Greenwich. The Observatory of Paris was built
in 1667. It was there that the first Cassini made many of his
discoveries; three of his descendants have since labored in the same
place, and two others of his family, the Maraldis;<a
id="fnanchor127-7" href="#note127-7"><span
class="fnanchor">127</span></a> besides many other eminent
astronomers, as Picard, La Hire, Lefêvre, Fouchy, Legentil, Chappe,
Méchain, Bouvard. Greenwich Observatory was built a few years later
(1675); and ever since its erection, the observations there made have
been the foundation of the greatest improvements which astronomy, for
the time, received. Flamsteed, Halley, Bradley, Bliss, Maskelyne,
Pond, have occupied the place in succession: on the retirement of the
last-named astronomer in 1835, Professor Airy was removed thither from
the Cambridge Observatory. In every state, and in almost every
principality in Europe, Observatories have been established; but these
have often fallen speedily into inaction, or have contributed little
to the progress of astronomy, because their observations have not been
published. From the same causes, the numerous private observatories
which exist throughout Europe have added little to our knowledge,
except where the attention of the astronomer has been directed to some
definite points; as, for instance, the magnificent labors of the
Herschels, or the skilful observations made by Mr. Pond with the
Westbury circle, which first pointed out the error of graduation of
the Greenwich quadrants. The Observations, now regularly published,<a
id="fnanchor128-7" href="#note128-7"><span
class="fnanchor">128</span></a> are those of Greenwich, begun by
Maskelyne, and continued quarterly by Mr. Pond; those of Königsberg,
published by Bessel since 1814; of Vienna, by Littrow since 1820; of
Speier, by Schwerd since 1826; those of Cambridge, commenced by Airy
in 1828; of Armagh, by Robinson in 1829. Besides these, a number of
useful observations have been published in journals and occasional
forms; as, for instance, those of Zach, made by Seeberg, near Gotha,
since 1788; and others have been employed in forming catalogues, of
which we shall speak shortly.</p>

<i>Astronomische Nachrichten</i>.]</p>
<p>Nor has the establishment of observatories been confined to Europe.
In 1786, M. de Beauchamp, at the expense of Louis the Sixteenth,
erected an observatory at Bagdad, “built to restore the Chaldean and
Arabian observations,” as the inscription stated; but, probably, the
restoration once effected, the main intention had been fulfilled, and
little perseverance in observing was thought necessary. In 1828, the
British government completed the building of an observatory at the
Cape of Good Hope, which Lacaille had already made an astronomical
station by his observations there at an earlier period (1750); and an
observatory formed in New South Wales by Sir T. M. Brisbane in 1822,
and presented by him to the government, is also in activity. The East
India Company has founded observatories at Madras, Bombay, and St.
Helena; and observations made at the former of these places, and at
St. Helena, have been published.</p>
<p>The bearing of the work done at such observatories upon the past
progress of astronomy, has already been seen in the preceding
narrative. Their bearing upon the present condition of the science
will be the subject of a few remarks <a
href="#ab7-4">hereafter</a>.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Scientific Societies.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> influence of Scientific Societies, or
Academical Bodies, has also been very powerful in the subject before
us. In all branches of knowledge, the use of such associations of
studious and inquiring men is great; the clearness and coherence of a
speculator’s ideas, and their agreement with facts (the two main
conditions of scientific truth), are severally but beneficially tested
by collision with other minds. In astronomy, moreover, the vast extent
of the subject makes requisite the division of labor and the support
of sympathy. The Royal Societies of London and of Paris were founded
nearly at the same time as the metropolitan Observatories of the two
countries. We have seen what constellations of philosophers, and what
activity of research, existed at those periods; these philosophers
appear in the lists, their discoveries <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page479">479</a></span> in the publications, of the
above-mentioned eminent Societies. As the progress of physical
science, and principally of astronomy, attracted more and more
admiration, Academies were created in other countries. That of Berlin
was founded by Leibnitz in 1710; that of St Petersburg was established
by Peter the Great in 1725; and both these have produced highly
valuable Memoirs. In more modern times these associations have
multiplied almost beyond the power of estimation. They have been
formed according to divisions, both of locality and of subject,
conformable to the present extent of science, and the vast population
of its cultivators. It would be useless to attempt to give a view
either of their number or of the enormous mass of scientific
literature which their Transactions present. But we may notice, as
especially connected with our present subject, the Astronomical
Society of London, founded in 1820, which gave a strong impulse to the
pursuit of the science in England.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 4.&#8212;<i>Patrons of Astronomy.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> advantages which letters and philosophy
derive from the patronage of the great have sometimes been questioned;
that love of knowledge, it has been thought, cannot be genuine which
requires such stimulation, nor those speculations free and true which
are thus forced into being. In the sciences of observation and
calculation, however, in which disputed questions can be
experimentally decided, and in which opinions are not disturbed by
men’s practical principles and interests, there is nothing necessarily
operating to poison or neutralize the resources which wealth and power
supply to the investigation of truth.</p>
<p>Astronomy has, in all ages, flourished under the favor of the rich
and powerful; in the period of which we speak, this was eminently the
case. Louis the Fourteenth gave to the astronomy of France a
distinction which, without him, it could not have attained. No step
perhaps tended more to this than his bringing the celebrated Dominic
Cassini to Paris. This Italian astronomer (for he was born at
Permaldo, in the county of Nice, and was professor at Bologna), was
already in possession of a brilliant reputation, when the French
ambassador, in the name of his sovereign, applied to Pope Clement the
Ninth, and to the senate of Bologna, that he should be allowed to
remove to Paris. The request was granted only so far as an absence of
six years; but at the end of that time, the benefits and honors which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page480">480</a></span> the king had
conferred upon him, fixed him in France. The impulse which his arrival
(in 1669) and his residence gave to astronomy, showed the wisdom of
the measure. In the same spirit, the French government drew to Paris
Römer from Denmark, Huyghens from Holland, and gave a pension to
Hevelius, and a large sum when his observatory at Dantzic had been
destroyed by fire in 1679.</p>
<p>When the sovereigns of Prussia and Russia were exerting themselves
to encourage the sciences in their countries, they followed the same
course which had been so successful in France. Thus, as we have <a
href="#v1page431">said</a>, the Czar Peter took Delisle to Petersburg
in 1725; the celebrated Frederick the Great drew to Berlin, Voltaire
and Maupertuis, Euler and Lagrange; and the Empress Catharine obtained
in the same way Euler, two of the Bernoulli’s, and other
mathematicians. In none of these instances, however, did it happen
that “the generous plant did still its stock renew,” as we have seen
was the case at Paris, with the Cassinis, and their kinsmen the
Maraldis.</p>
<p>[2d Ed.] [I may notice among instances of the patronage of
Astronomy, the reward at present offered by the King of Denmark for
the discovery of a Comet.]</p>
<p>It is not necessary to mention here the more recent cases in which
sovereigns or statesmen have attempted to patronize individual
astronomers.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 5.&#8212;<i>Astronomical Expeditions.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">Besides</span> the pensions thus bestowed upon
resident mathematicians and astronomers, the governments of Europe
have wisely and usefully employed considerable sums upon expeditions
and travels undertaken by men of science for some appropriate object.
Thus Picard, in 1671, was sent to Uraniburg, the scene of Tycho’s
observations, to determine its latitude and its longitude. He found
that “the City of the Skies” had utterly disappeared from the earth;
and even its foundations were retraced with difficulty. With the same
object, that of accurately connecting the labors of the places which
had been at different periods the metropolis of astronomy, Chazelles
was sent, in 1693, to Alexandria. We have already mentioned Richer’s
astronomical expedition to Cayenne in 1672. Varin and Deshayes<a
id="fnanchor129-7" href="#note129-7"><span
class="fnanchor">129</span></a> were sent a few years later into the
same regions for similar purposes. Halley’s expedition to St. <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page481">481</a></span> Helena in 1677, with
the view of observing the southern stars, was at his own expense; but
at a later period (in 1698), he was appointed to the command of a
small vessel by King William the Third, in order that he might make
his magnetical observations in all parts of the world. Lacaille was
maintained by the French government four years at the Cape of Good
Hope (1750&#8211;4), for the purpose of observing the stars of the
southern hemisphere. The two transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769,
occasioned expeditions to be sent to Kamtschatka and Tobolsk by the
Russians; to the Isle of France, and to Coromandel, by the French;<a
id="fnanchor130-7" href="#note130-7"><span
class="fnanchor">130</span></a> to the isles of St. Helena and
Otaheite by the English; to Lapland and to Drontheim, by the Swedes
and Danes. I shall not here refer to the measures of degrees executed
by various nations, still less the innumerable surveys by land and
sea; but I may just notice the successive English expeditions of
Captains Basil Hall, Sabine, and Foster, for the purpose of
determining the length of the seconds’ pendulum in different
latitudes; and the voyages of M. Biot and others, sent by the French
government for the same purpose. Much has been done in this way, but
not more than the progress of astronomy absolutely required; and only
a small portion of that which the completion of the subject calls
for.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 6.&#8212;<i>Present State of Astronomy.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">Astronomy</span>, in its present condition, is not
only much the most advanced of the sciences, but is also in far more
favorable circumstances than any other science for making any future
advance, as soon as this is possible. The general methods and
conditions by which such an advantage is to be obtained for the
various sciences, we shall endeavor hereafter to throw some light
upon; but in the mean time, we may notice here some of the
circumstances in which this peculiar felicity of the present state of
astronomy may be traced.</p>
<p>The science is cultivated by a number of votaries, with an
assiduity and labor, and with an expenditure of private and public
resources, to which no other subject approaches; and the mode of its
cultivation in all public and most private observatories, has this
character&#8212;that it forms, at the same time, a constant process of
verification of existing discoveries, and a strict search for any new
discoverable laws. The observations made are immediately referred to
the best tables, and <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page482">482</a></span> corrected by the best formulæ which are
known; and if the result of such a reduction leaves any thing
unaccounted for, the astronomer is forthwith curious and anxious to
trace this deviation from the expected numbers to its rule and its
origin; and till the first, at least, of these things is performed, he
is dissatisfied and unquiet. The reference of observations to the
state of the heavens as known by previous researches, implies a great
amount of calculation. The exact places of the stars at some standard
period are recorded in <i>Catalogues</i>; their movements, according
to the laws hitherto detected, are arranged in <i>Tables</i>; and if
these tables are applied to predict the numbers which observation on
each day ought to give, they form <i>Ephemerides</i>. Thus the
catalogues of fixed stars of Flamsteed, of Piazzi, of Maskelyne, of
the Astronomical Society, are the basis of all observation. To these
are applied the Corrections for Refraction of Bradley or Bessel, and
those for Aberration, for Nutation, for Precession, of the best modern
astronomers. The observations so corrected enable the observer to
satisfy himself of the delicacy and fidelity of his measures of time
and space; his Clocks and his Arcs. But this being done, different
stars so observed can be compared with each other, and the astronomer
can then endeavor further to correct his fundamental
Elements;&#8212;his Catalogue, or his Tables of Corrections. In these
Tables, though previous discovery has ascertained the law, yet the
exact quantity, the <i>constant</i> or <i>coefficient</i> of the
formula, can be exactly fixed only by numerous observations and
comparisons. This is a labor which is still going on, and in which
there are differences of opinion on almost every point; but the amount
of these differences is the strongest evidence of the certainty and
exactness of those doctrines in which all agree. Thus Lindenau makes
the coefficient of Nutation rather less than nine seconds, which other
astronomers give as about nine seconds and three-tenths. The Tables of
Refraction are still the subject of much discussion, and of many
attempts at improvement. And after or amid these discussions, arise
questions whether there be not other corrections of which the law has
not yet been assigned. The most remarkable example of such questions
is the controversy concerning the existence of an Annual Parallax of
the fixed stars, which Brinkley asserted, and which Pond denied. Such
a dispute between two of the best modern observers, only proves that
the quantity in question, if it really exist, is of the same order as
the hitherto unsurmounted errors of instruments and corrections.</p>
<p>[2d Ed.] [The belief in an appreciable parallax of some of the
fixed <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page483">483</a></span> stars
appears to gain ground among astronomers. The parallax of 61
<i>Cygni</i>, as determined by Bessel, is 0″·34; about one-third of a
second, or <span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>10000</sub></span> of a degree. That of
<i>α Centauri</i>, as determined by Maclear, is 0″·9, or <span
style="font-size: 80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4000</sub></span> of a
degree.]</p>
<p>But besides the fixed stars and their corrections, the astronomer
has the motions of the planets for his field of action. The
established theories have given us tables of these, from which their
daily places are calculated and given in our Ephemerides, as the
<i>Berliner Jahrbuch</i> of Encke, or the <i>Nautical Almanac</i>,
published by the government of this country, the <i>Connaissance des
Tems</i> which appears at Paris, or the <i>Effemeridi di Milano</i>.
The comparison of the observed with the tabular place, gives us the
means of correcting the coefficients of the tables; and thus of
obtaining greater exactness in the constants of the solar system. But
these constants depend upon the mass and form of the bodies of which
the system is composed; and in this province, as well as in sidereal
astronomy, different determinations, obtained by different paths, may
be compared; and doubts may be raised and may be solved. In this way,
the perturbations produced by Jupiter on different planets gave rise
to a doubt whether his attraction be really proportional to his mass,
as the law of universal gravitation asserts. The doubt has been solved
by Nicolai and Encke in Germany, and by Airy in England. The mass of
Jupiter, as shown by the perturbations of Juno, of Vesta, and of
Encke’s Comet, and by the motion of his outermost Satellite, is found
to agree, though different from the mass previously received on the
authority of Laplace. Thus also Burckhardt, Littrow, and Airy, have
corrected the elements of the Solar Tables. In other cases, the
astronomer finds that no change of the coefficients will bring the
Tables and the observations to a coincidence;&#8212;that a new term in
the formula is wanting. He obtains, as far as he can, the law of this
unknown term; if possible, he traces it to some known or probable
cause. Thus Mr. Airy, in his examination of the Solar Tables, not only
found that a diminution of the received mass of Mars was necessary,
but perceived discordances which led him to suspect the existence of a
new inequality. Such an inequality was at length found to result
theoretically from the attraction of Venus. Encke, in his examination
of his comet, found a diminution of the periodic time in the
successive revolutions; from which he inferred the existence of a
resisting medium. Uranus still deviates from his tabular place, and
the cause remains yet to be discovered. (But see the <a
href="#neptune"><i>Additions</i></a> to this volume.) <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page484">484</a></span></p>
<p>Thus it is impossible that an assertion, false to any amount which
the existing state of observation can easily detect, should have any
abiding prevalence in astronomy. Such errors may long keep their
ground in any science which is contained mainly in didactic works, and
studied in the closet, but not acted upon elsewhere;&#8212;which is
reasoned upon much, but brought to the test of experiment rarely or
never. Here, on the contrary, an error, if it arise, makes its way
into the Tables, into the Ephemeris, into the observer’s nightly List,
or his sheet of Reductions; the evidence of sense flies in its face in
a thousand observatories; the discrepancy is traced to its source, and
soon disappears forever.</p>
<p>In this favored branch of knowledge, the most recondite and
delicate discoveries can no more suffer doubt or contradiction, than
the most palpable facts of sense which the face of nature offers to
our notice. The last great discovery in astronomy&#8212;the motion of
the stars arising from Aberration&#8212;is as obvious to the vast
population of astronomical observers in all parts of the world, as the
motion of the stars about the pole is to the casual night wanderer.
And this immunity from the danger of any large error in the received
doctrines, is a firm platform on which the astronomer can stand and
exert himself to reach perpetually further and further into the region
of the unknown.</p>
<p>The same scrupulous care and diligence in recording all that has
hitherto been ascertained, has been extended to those departments of
astronomy in which we have as yet no general principles which serve to
bind together our acquired treasures. These records may be considered
as constituting a <i>Descriptive Astronomy</i>; such are, for
instance, Catalogues of Stars, and Maps of the Heavens, Maps of the
Moon, representations of the appearance of the Sun and Planets as seen
through powerful telescopes, pictures of Nebulæ, of Comets, and the
like. Thus, besides the Catalogue of Fundamental Stars which may be
considered as standard points of reference for all observations of the
Sun, Moon, and Planets, there exist many large catalogues of smaller
stars. Flamsteed’s <i>Historia Celestis</i>, which much surpassed any
previous catalogue, contained above 3000 stars. But in 1801, the
French <i>Histoire Céleste</i> appeared, comprising observations of
50,000 stars. Catalogues or charts of other special portions of the
sky have been published more recently; and in 1825, the Berlin Academy
proposed to the astronomers of Europe to carry on this work by
portioning out the heavens among them.</p>
<p>[2d Ed.] [Before Flamsteed, the best Catalogue of the Stars was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page485">485</a></span> Tycho Brahe’s,
containing the places of about 1000 stars, determined very roughly
with the naked eye. On the occasion of a project of finding the
longitude, which was offered to Charles II., in 1674, Flamsteed
represented that the method was quite useless, in consequence, among
other things, of the inaccuracy of Tycho’s places of the stars.
Flamsteed’s letters being shown King Charles, he was startled at the
assertion of the fixed stars’ places being false in the Catalogue, and
said, with some vehemence, “He must have them anew observed, examined,
and corrected for the use of his seamen.” This was the immediate
occasion of building Greenwich Observatory, and placing Flamsteed
there as an observer. Flamsteed’s <i>Historia Celestis</i> contained
above 3000 stars, observed with telescopic sights. It has recently
been republished with important improvements by Mr. Baily. See Baily’s
<i>Flamsteed</i>, p. 38.</p>
<p>The French <i>Histoire Céleste</i> was published in 1801 by
Lalande, containing 50,000 stars, simply as observed by himself and
other French astronomers. The reduction of the observations contained
in this Catalogue to the mean places at the beginning of the year 1800
may be effected by means of Tables published by Schumacher for that
purpose in 1825.</p>
<p>In 1807, Piazzi’s Catalogue of 6748 stars, founded on Maskelyne’s
Catalogue of 1700, was published; afterwards extended to 7646 stars in
1814. This is considered as the greatest work undertaken by any modern
astronomer; the observations being well made, reduced, and compared
with those of former astronomers. Piazzi’s Catalogue is the standard
and accurate Catalogue, as the <i>Histoire Céleste</i> is the standard
approximate Catalogue for small stars. But the new planets were
discovered mostly by a comparison of the heavens with Bode’s (Berlin)
Catalogue.</p>
<p>I may mention other Catalogues of Stars which have recently been
published. Pond’s Catalogue contains 1112 Northern stars; Johnson’s,
606; Wrottesley’s, 1318 (in Right Ascension only); Airy’s First
Cambridge Catalogue, 726; his Greenwich Catalogue, 1439. Pearson’s has
520 zodiacal stars; Groombridge’s, 4243 circumpolar stars as far as 50
degrees of North Polar distance; Santini’s, a zone 18 degrees North of
the equator. Besides these, Mr. Taylor has published, by order of the
Madras government, a Catalogue of 11,000 stars observed by him at
Madras; and Rumker, who observed in the Observatory established by Sir
Thomas Brisbane at Paramatta (in Australia), has commenced a Catalogue
which is to contain 12,000. Mr. Baily <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page486">486</a></span> published two Standard Catalogues; that
of the Royal Astronomical Society, containing 2881 stars; and that of
the British Association, containing 8377 stars. I omit other
Catalogues, as those of Argelander, &amp;c., and Catalogues of
Southern Stars.</p>
<p>Of the Berlin Maps, fourteen hours in Right Ascension have been
published; and their value may be judged of by this circumstance, that
it was in a great measure by comparing the heavens with these Maps
that the new planet Astræa was discovered. The Zone observations made
at Königsberg, by the late illustrious astronomer Bessel, deserve to
be mentioned, as embracing a vast number of stars.</p>
<p>The common mode of <i>designating the Stars</i> is founded upon the
ancient constellations as given by Ptolemy; to which Bayer, of
Augsburg, in his <i>Uranometria</i>, added the artifice of designating
the brightest stars in each constellation by the Greek letters, α, β,
γ, &amp;c., applied in order of brightness, and when these were
exhausted, the Latin letters. Flamsteed used numbers. As the number of
observed stars increased, various methods were employed for
designating them; and the confusion which has been thus introduced,
both with regard to the boundaries of the constellations and the
nomenclature of the stars in each, has been much complained of lately.
Some attempts have been made to remedy this variety and disorder. Mr.
Argelander has recently recorded stars, according to their magnitudes
as seen by the naked eye, in a <i>Neue Uranometrie</i>.</p>
<p>Among representations of the Moon I may mention Hevelius’s
<i>Selenographia</i>, a work of former times, and Beer and Madler’s
Map of the Moon, recently published.]</p>
<p>I have <a href="#v1page467">already</a> said something of the
observations of the two Herschels on <i>Double Stars</i>, which have
led to a knowledge of the law of the revolution of such systems. But
besides these, the same illustrious astronomers have accumulated
enormous treasures of observations of <i>Nebulæ</i>; the materials, it
may be, hereafter, of some vast new generalization with respect to the
history of the system of the universe.</p>
<p>[2d Ed.] [A few measures of Double Stars are to be found in
previous astronomical records. But the epoch of the creation of this
part of the science of astronomy must be placed at the beginning of
the present century, when Sir William Herschel (in 1802) published in
the <i>Phil. Trans.</i> a Catalogue of 500 new Nebulæ of various
classes, and in the <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1803, a paper “On the changes
in the relative situation of the Double Stars in 25 years.” In
succeeding papers he pursued the subject. In one in 1814 he noticed
the breaking up of the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page487">487</a></span> Milky Way in different places,
apparently from some principle of Attraction; and in this, and in one
in 1817, he published those remarkable views on the distribution of
the stars in our own cluster as forming a large stratum, and on the
connection of stars and nebulæ (the stars appearing sometimes to be
accompanied by nebulæ, sometimes to have absorbed a part of the
nebula, and sometimes to have been formed from nebulæ), which have
been accepted and propounded by others as the <i>Nebular Theory</i>.
Sir William Herschel’s last paper was a Catalogue of 145 new Double
Stars communicated to the Astronomical Society in 1822. In 1827 M.
Struve, of Dorpat (in Russia), published his <i>Catalogus Novus</i>,
containing the places of 3112 double stars. While this was going on,
Sir John Herschel and Sir James South published (in the <i>Phil.
Trans.</i> 1824) accurate measures of 380 Double and Triple Stars, to
which Sir J. South afterwards added 458. Mr. Dunlop published measures
of 253 Southern Double Stars. Other Observations have been published
by Capt. Smyth, Mr. Dawes, &amp;c. The great work of Struve,
<i>Mensuræ Micrometricæ</i>, &amp;c., contains 3134 such objects,
including most of Sir W. Herschel’s Double Stars. Sir J. Herschel in
1826, 7, and 8 presented to the Astronomical Society about 1000
measures of Double Stars; and in 1830, good measures of 1236, made
with his 20-feet reflector. His paper in vol. v. of the <i>Ast. Soc.
Mem.</i>, besides measures of 364 such stars, exhibits all the most
striking results, as to the motion of Double Stars, which have yet
been obtained. In 1835 he carried his 20-feet reflector to the Cape of
Good Hope for the purpose of completing the survey of Double Stars and
Nebulæ in the southern hemisphere with the same instruments which had
explored the northern skies. He returned from the Cape in 1838, and is
now (1846) about to give the world the results of his labors. Besides
the stars just mentioned, his work will contain from 1500 to 2000
additional double stars; making a gross number of above 8000; in which
of course are included a number of objects of no great scientific
interest, but in which also are contained the materials of the most
important discoveries which remain to be made by astronomers. The
publication of Sir John Herschel’s great work upon Double Stars and
Nebulæ is looked for with eager interest by astronomers.</p>
<p>Of the observations of Nebulæ we may say what has just been said of
the observations of Double Stars;&#8212;that they probably contain the
materials of important future discoveries. It is impossible not to
regard these phenomena with reference to the <i>Nebular
Hypothesis</i>, which has been propounded by Laplace, and much more
strongly <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page488">488</a></span>
insisted upon by other persons;&#8212;namely, the hypothesis that
systems of revolving planets, of which the Solar System is an example,
arise from the gradual contraction and separation of vast masses of
nebulous matter. Yet it does not appear that any changes have been
observed in nebulæ which tend to confirm this hypothesis; and the most
powerful telescope in the world, recently erected by the Earl of
Rosse, has given results which militate against the hypothesis;
inasmuch as it has shown that what appeared a diffused nebulous mass
is, by a greater power of vision, resolved, in all cases yet examined,
into separate stars.</p>
<p>When astronomical phenomena are viewed with reference to the
Nebular Hypothesis, they do not belong so properly to Astronomy, in
the view here taken of it, as to Cosmogony. If such speculations
should acquire any scientific value, we shall have to arrange them
among those which I have called <i>Palætiological</i> Sciences;
namely, those Sciences which contemplate the universe, the earth, and
its inhabitants, with reference to their historical changes and the
causes of those changes.]</p>

<hr class="one" />
<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THERE</span> is a difficulty in
writing for popular readers a History of the Inductive Sciences,
arising from this;&#8212;that the sympathy of such readers goes most
readily and naturally along the course which leads to false science
and to failure. Men, in the outset of their attempts at knowledge, are
prone to rush from a few hasty observations of facts to some wide and
comprehensive principles; and then, to frame a system on these
principles. This is the opposite of the method by which the Sciences
have really and historically been conducted; namely, the method of a
gradual and cautious ascent from observation to principles of limited
generality, and from them to others more general. This latter, the
true Scientific Method, is <i>Induction</i>, and has led to the
<i>Inductive Sciences</i>. The other, the spontaneous and delusive
course, has been termed by Francis Bacon, who first clearly pointed
out the distinction, and warned men of the error, <i>Anticipation</i>.
The hopelessness of this course is the great lesson of his philosophy;
but by this course proceeded all the earlier attempts of the Greek
philosophers to obtain a knowledge of the Universe.</p>
<p>Laborious observation, narrow and modest inference, caution, slow
and gradual advance, limited knowledge, are all unwelcome efforts and
restraints to the mind of man, when his speculative spirit is once
roused: yet these are the necessary conditions of all advance in the
Inductive Sciences. Hence, as I have said, it is difficult to win the
sympathy of popular readers to the true history of these sciences. The
career of bold systems and fanciful pretences of knowledge is more
entertaining and striking. Not only so, but the bold guesses and
fanciful reasonings of men unchecked by doubt or fear of failure are
often presented as the dictates of <em>Common Sense</em>;&#8212;as the
plain, unsophisticated, unforced reason of man, acting according to no
artificial rules, but following its own natural course. Such Common
Sense, while it <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page490">490</a></span>
complacently plumes itself on its clear-sightedness in rejecting
arbitrary systems of others, is no less arbitrary in its own
arguments, and often no less fanciful in its inventions, than those
whom it condemns.</p>
<p>We cannot take a better representative of the Common Sense of the
ancient Greeks than Socrates: and we find that his Common Sense,
judging with such admirable sagacity and acuteness respecting moral
and practical matters, offered, when he applied it to physical
questions, examples of the unconscious assumptions and fanciful
reasonings which, as we have said, Common Sense on such subjects
commonly involves.</p>
<p>Socrates, Xenophon tells us (<i>Memorabilia</i>, iv. 7),
recommended his friends not to study astronomy, so as to pursue it
into scientific details. This was practical advice: but he proceeded
further to speak of the palpable mistakes made by those who had
carried such studies farthest. Anaxagoras, for instance, he said, held
that the Sun was a Fire:&#8212;he did not consider that men can look
at a fire, but they cannot look at the Sun; they become dark by the
Sun shining upon them, but not so by the fire. He did not consider
that no plants can grow well except they have sunshine, but if they
are exposed to the fire they are spoiled. Again, when he said that the
Sun was a stone red-hot, he did not consider that a stone heated by
the fire is not luminous, and soon cools, but the Sun is always
luminous and always hot.</p>
<p>We may easily conceive how a disciple of Anaxagoras would reply to
these arguments. He would say, for example, as we should probably say
at present, that if there were a mass of matter so large and so hot as
Anaxagoras supposed the Sun to be, its light might be as great and its
heat as permanent as the heat and light of the Sun are, as yet, known
to be. In this case the arguments of Socrates are at any rate no
better than the doctrine of Anaxagoras.</p>

<h4 class="five" id="platoideas"><i>The Platonic Doctrine of
Ideas.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IN</span> speaking of the Foundation
of the Greek School Philosophy, I have referred to the dialogue
entitled <i>Parmenides</i>, commonly ascribed to Plato. And the
doctrines ascribed to Parmenides, in that and in other works of
ancient authors, are certainly remarkable examples of the tendency
which prevailed among the Greeks to rush at once to the highest
generalizations of which the human mind is capable. The distinctive
dogma of the Eleatic School, of which Parmenides was one of the most
illustrious teachers, was that <i>All Things are One</i>. This indeed
was rather a doctrine of metaphysical theology than of physical
science. It tended to, or agreed with, the doctrine that All things
are God:&#8212;the doctrine commonly called <i>Pantheism</i>. But the
tenet of the Platonists which was commonly put in opposition to this,
that we must seek <i>The One in the Many</i>, had a bearing upon
physical science; at least, if we interpret it, as it is generally
interpreted, that we must seek the one Law which pervades a
multiplicity of Phenomena. We may however take the liberty of
remarking, that to speak of a Rule which is exemplified in many cases,
as being “the One in the Many” (a way of speaking by which we put out
of sight the consideration what very different kinds of things <i>the
One</i> and <i>the Many</i> are), is a mode of expression which makes
a very simple matter look very mysterious; and is another example of
the tendency which urges speculative men to aim at metaphysical
generality rather than scientific truth.</p>
<p>The Dialogue <i>Parmenides</i> is, as I have said, commonly
referred to Plato. Yet it is entirely different in substance, manner,
and tendency <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page492">492</a></span>
from the most characteristic of the Platonic Dialogues. In these,
Socrates is represented as finally successful in refuting or routing
his adversaries, however confident their tone and however popular
their assertions. They are angered or humbled; he retains his good
temper and his air of superiority, and when they are exhausted, he
sums up in his own way.</p>
<p>In the <i>Parmenides</i>, on the contrary, everything is the
reverse of this. Parmenides and Zeno exchange good-humoured smiles at
Socrates’s criticism, when the bystanders expect them to grow angry.
They listen to Socrates while he propounds Plato’s doctrine of Ideas;
and reply to him with solid arguments which he does not answer, and
which have never yet been answered. Parmenides, in a patronising way,
lets him off; and having done this, being much entreated, he
pronounces a discourse concerning the One and the Many; which, obscure
as it may seem to us, was obviously intended to be irrefutable: and
during the whole of this part of the Dialogue, the friend of Socrates
appears only as a passive respondent, saying <i>Yes</i> or <i>No</i>
as the assertions of Parmenides require him to do; just in the same
way in which the opponents of Socrates are represented in other
Dialogues.</p>
<p>These circumstances, to which other historical difficulties might
be added, seem to show plainly that the <i>Parmenides</i> must be
regarded as an Eleatic, not as a Platonic Dialogue;&#8212;as composed
to confute, not to assert, the Platonic doctrine of Ideas.</p>
<p>The Platonic doctrine of Ideas has an important bearing upon the
philosophy of Science, and was suggested in a great measure by the
progress which the Greeks had really made in Geometry, Astronomy, and
other Sciences, as I shall elsewhere endeavor to show. This doctrine
has been recommended in our own time,<a id="fnanchor1-A"
href="#note1-A"><span class="fnanchor">1</span></a> as containing “a
mighty substance of imperishable truth.” It cannot fail to be
interesting to see in what manner the doctrine is presented by those
who thus judge of it. The following is the statement of its leading
features which they give us.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-A"
href="#fnanchor1-A">1</a></span> A. Butler’s <i>Lectures</i>, Second
Series, Lect. viii. p. 132.</div>
<p>Man’s soul is made to contain not merely a consistent scheme of its
own notions, but a direct apprehension of <em>real and eternal laws
beyond it</em>. These real and eternal laws are things
<em>intelligible</em>, and not things sensible. The laws, impressed
upon creation by its Creator, and apprehended by man, are something
equally distinct from the Creator <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page493">493</a></span> and from man; and the whole mass of them
may be termed the World of Things purely Intelligible.</p>
<p>Further; there are qualities in the Supreme and Ultimate Cause of
all, which are manifested in his creation; and not merely manifested,
but in a manner&#8212;after being brought out of his super-essential
nature into the stage of being which is below him, but next to
him&#8212;are then, by the causative act of creation, deposited in
things, differencing them one from the other, so that the things
participate of them (μετέχουσι), communicate with them
(κοινωνοῦσι).</p>
<p>The Intelligence of man, excited to reflection by the impressions
of these objects, thus (though themselves transitory) participant of a
divine quality, may rise to higher conceptions of the perfections thus
faintly exhibited; and inasmuch as the perfections are unquestionably
<em>real</em> existences, and known to be such in the very act of
contemplation, this may be regarded as a distinct intellectual
apprehension of them;&#8212;a union of the Reason with the Ideas in
that sphere of being which is common to both.</p>
<p>Finally, the Reason, in proportion as it learns to contemplate the
Perfect and Eternal, desires the enjoyment of such contemplations in a
more consummate degree, and cannot be fully satisfied except in the
actual fruition of the Perfect itself.</p>
<p>These propositions taken together constitute the <span
class="sc">Theory of Ideas</span>. When we have to treat of the
Philosophy of Science, it may be worth our while to resume the
consideration of this subject.</p>
<hr class="one" />
<p>In this part of the History, the <i>Timæus</i> of Plato is referred
to as an example of the loose notions of the Greek philosophers in
their physical reasonings. And undoubtedly this Dialogue does
remarkably exemplify the boldness of the early Greek attempts at
generalization on such subjects. Yet in this and in other parts the
writings of Plato contain speculations which may be regarded as
containing germs of true physical science; inasmuch as they assume
that the phenomena of the world are governed by mathematical
laws;&#8212;by relations of space and number;&#8212;and endeavor, too
boldly, no doubt, but not vaguely or loosely, to assign those laws.
The Platonic writings offer, in this way, so much that forms a Prelude
to the Astronomy and other Physical Sciences of the Greeks, that they
will deserve our notice, as supplying materials for the next two Books
of the History, in which these subjects are treated of. <span

<span class="sc">Failure of the Greek Physical Philosophy.</span></h3>
<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Francis Bacon’s Remarks.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THOUGH</span> we do not accept, as
authority, even the judgments of Francis Bacon, and shall have to
estimate the strong and the weak parts of his, no less than of other
philosophies, we shall find his remarks on the Greek philosophers very
instructive. Thus he says of Aristotle, (<i>Nov. Org.</i> 1. Aph.
lxiii.):</p>
<p>“He is an example of the kind of philosophy in which much is made
out of little; so that the basis of experience is too narrow. He
corrupted Natural Philosophy by his Logic, and made the world out of
his Categories. He disposed of the distinction of <em>dense</em> and
<em>rare</em>, by which bodies occupy more or less dimensions or
space, by the frigid distinction of <em>act</em> and <em>power</em>.
He assigned to each kind of body a single proper motion, so that if
they have any other motion they must receive it from some extraneous
source; and imposed many other arbitrary rules upon Nature; being
everywhere more careful how one may give a ready answer, and make a
positive assertion, than how he may apprehend the variety of
nature.</p>
<p>“And this appears most evidently by the comparison of his
philosophy with the other philosophies which had any vogue in Greece.
For the <i>Homoiomeria</i><a id="fnanchor2-A" href="#note2-A"><span
class="fnanchor">2</span></a> of Anaxagoras, the <i>Atoms</i> of
Leucippus and Democritus, the Heaven and Earth of Parmenides, the Love
and Hate of Empedocles, the Fire of Heraclitus, had some trace of the
thoughts of a natural philosopher; some savor of experience, and
nature, and bodily things; while the Physics of Aristotle, in general,
sound only of Logical Terms.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note2-A"
href="#fnanchor2-A">2</a></span> For these technical forms of the
Greeks, see <a href="#b1-2-3">Sec. 3</a> of this chapter.</div>
<p>“Nor let any one be moved by this&#8212;that in his books <i>Of
Animals</i>, and in his <i>Problems</i>, and in others of his tracts,
there is often a quoting of experiments. For he had made up his mind
beforehand; and did not consult experience in order to make right
propositions and axioms, but when he had settled his system to his
will, he twisted experience <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page495">495</a></span> round, and made her bend to his system:
so that in this way he is even more wrong than his modern followers,
the Schoolmen, who have deserted experience altogether.”</p>
<p>We may note also what Bacon says of the term <i>Sophist</i>. (Aph.
lxxi.) “The wisdom of the Greeks was professorial, and prone to run
into disputations: which kind is very adverse to the discovery of
Truth. And the name of <i>Sophists</i>, which was cast in the way of
contempt, by those who wished to be reckoned philosophers, upon the
old professors of rhetoric, Gorgias, Protagoras, Hippias, Polus, does,
in fact, fit the whole race of them, Plato,<a id="fnanchor3-A"
href="#note3-A"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a> Aristotle, Zeno,
Epicurus, Theophrastus; and their successors, Chrysippus, Carneades,
and the rest.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note3-A"
href="#fnanchor3-A">3</a></span> It is curious that the attempt to
show that Plato’s opponents were not commonly illusive and immoral
reasoners, has been represented as an attempt to obliterate the
distinction of “Sophist” and “Philosopher.”&#8212;See A. Butler’s
<i>Lectures</i>, i. 357. Note.</div>
<p>That these two classes of teachers, as moralists, were not
different in their kind, has been urged by Mr. Grote in a very
striking and amusing manner. But Bacon speaks of them here as physical
philosophers; in which character he holds that all of them were
<i>sophists</i>, that is, illusory reasoners.</p>
<h4><i>Aristotle’s Account of the Rainbow.</i></h4>
<p>To exemplify the state of physical knowledge among the Greeks, we
may notice briefly Aristotle’s account of the <i>Rainbow</i>; a
phenomenon so striking and definite, and so completely explained by
the optical science of later times. We shall see that not only the
explanations there offered were of no value, but that even the
observation of facts, so common and so palpable, was inexact. In his
<i>Meteorologica</i> (lib. iii. c. 2) he says, “The Rainbow is never
more than a semicircle. And at sunset and sunrise, the circle is
least, but the arch is greatest; when the sun is high, the circle is
larger, but the arch is less.” This is erroneous, for the diameter of
the circle of which the arch of the rainbow forms a part, is always
the same, namely 82°. “After the autumnal equinox,” he adds, “it
appears at every hour of the day; but in the summer season, it does
not appear about noon.” It is curious that he did not see the reason
of this. The centre of the circle of which the rainbow is part, is
always opposite to the sun. And therefore if the sun be more than 41°
above the horizon, the centre of the rainbow will be so much below the
horizon, that the place of the rainbow will <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page496">496</a></span> be entirely below the horizon. In the
latitude of Athens, which is 38°, the equator is 52° above the
horizon, and the rainbow can be visible only when the sun is 11° lower
than it is at the equinoctial noon. These remarks, however, show a
certain amount of careful observation; and so do those which Aristotle
makes respecting the colors. “Two rainbows at most appear: and of
these, each has three colors; but those in the outer bow are duller;
and their order opposite to those in the inner. For in the inner bow
the first and largest arch is red; but in the outer bow the smallest
arch is red, the nearest to the inner; and the others in order. The
colors are red, green, and purple, such as painters cannot imitate.”
It is curious to observe how often modern painters disregard even the
order of the colors, which they could imitate, if they attended to
it.</p>
<p>It may serve to show the loose speculation which we oppose to
science, if we give Aristotle’s attempt to explain the phenomenon of
the Rainbow. It is produced, he says (c. iv.), by Reflexion
(ἀνάκλασις) from a cloud opposite to the sun, when the cloud forms
into drops. And as a reason for the red color, he says that a bright
object seen through darkness appears red, as the flame through the
smoke of a fire of green wood. This notion hardly deserves notice; and
yet it was taken up again by Göthe in our own time, in his
speculations concerning colors.</p>

<h4 class="five" id="platotim"><i>Plato’s Timæus and
Republic.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">ALTHOUGH</span> a great portion of
the physical speculations of the Greek philosophers was fanciful, and
consisted of doctrines which were rejected in the subsequent progress
of the Inductive Sciences; still many of these speculations must be
considered as forming a Prelude to more exact knowledge afterwards
attained; and thus, as really belonging to the Progress of knowledge.
These speculations express, as we have already said, the conviction
that the phenomena of nature are governed by laws of space and number;
and commonly, the mathematical laws which are thus asserted have some
foundation in the facts of nature. This is more especially the case in
the speculations of Plato. It has been justly stated by Professor
Thompson (A. Butler’s <i>Lectures</i>, Third Series, Lect. i. Note
11), that it is Plato’s merit to have discovered that the laws of the
physical universe are resolvable into numerical relations, and
therefore capable of being represented by mathematical formulæ. Of
this truth, it is there said, Aristotle does not betray the slightest
consciousness.</p>
<p>The <i>Timæus</i> of Plato contains a scheme of mathematical and
physical doctrines concerning the universe, which make it far more
analogous than any work of Aristotle to Treatises which, in modern
times, have borne the titles of <i>Principia</i>, <i>System of the
World</i>, and the like. And fortunately the work has recently been
well and carefully studied, with attention, not only to the language,
but to the doctrines and their bearing upon our real knowledge.
Stallbaum has published an edition of the Dialogue, and has compared
the opinions of Plato with those of Aristotle on the like subjects.
Professor Archer Butler of Dublin has devoted to it several of his
striking and eloquent Lectures; and these have been furnished with
valuable annotations by Professor Thompson of Cambridge; and M. The.
Henri Martin, then Professor at Rennes, published in 1841 two volumes
of <i>Etudes sur le Timée de Platon</i>, in <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page498">498</a></span> which the bearings of the work on
Science are very fully discussed. The Dialogue treats not only
concerning the numerical laws of harmonical sounds, of visual
appearances, and of the motions of planets and stars, but also
concerning heat, as well as light; and concerning water, ice, gold,
gems, iron, rust, and other natural objects;&#8212;concerning odors,
tastes, hearing, sight, light, colors, and the powers of sense in
general:&#8212;concerning the parts and organs of the body, as the
bones, the marrow, the brain, the flesh, muscles, tendons, ligaments,
nerves; the skin, the hair, the nails; the veins and arteries;
respiration; generation; and in short every obvious point of
physiology.</p>
<p>But the opinions delivered in the <i>Timæus</i> upon these latter
subjects have little to do with the progress of real knowledge. The
doctrines, on the other hand, which depend upon geometrical and
arithmetical relations, are portions or preludes of the sciences
which, in the fulness of time, assumed a mathematical form for the
expression of truth.</p>
<p>Among these may be mentioned the arithmetical relations of
harmonical sounds, to which I have <a href="#v1page105">referred</a>
in the History. These occur in various parts of Plato’s writings. In
the <i>Timæus</i>, in which the numbers are most fully given, the
meaning of the numbers is, at first sight, least obvious. The numbers
are given as representing the proportion of the parts of the Soul
(<i>Tim.</i> pp. 35, 36), which does not immediately refer us to the
relations of Sounds. But in a subsequent part of the Dialogue (47,
<span class="sc">d</span>), we are told that music is a privilege of
the hearing given on account of Harmony; and that Harmony has Cycles
corresponding to the movements of the Soul; (referring plainly to
those already asserted.) And the numbers which are thus given by Plato
as elements of harmony, are in a great measure the same as those which
express the musical relations of the tones of the musical scale at
this day in use, as M. Henri Martin shows (<i>Et. sur le Timée</i>,
note xxiii.) The intervals C to D, C to F, C to G, C to C, are
expressed by the fractions  <span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>9</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub></span>,  <span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>4</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub></span>,  <span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>,  <span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>1</sub></span>, and are now called a
Tone, a Fourth, a Fifth, an Octave. They were expressed by the same
fractions among the Greeks, and were called <i>Tone</i>,
<i>Diatessaron</i>, <i>Diapente</i>, <i>Diapason</i>. The Major and
Minor Third, and the Major and Minor Sixth, were however wanting, it
is conceived, in the musical scale of Plato.</p>
<p>The <i>Timæus</i> contains also a kind of theory of vision by
reflexion from a plane, and in a concave mirror; although the theory
is in this case less mathematical and less precise than that of
Euclid, referred to in <a href="#v1page100">chap. ii.</a> of this
Book.</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable speculations in the <i>Timæus</i> is
that in <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page499">499</a></span> which
the Regular Solids are assigned as the forms of the Elements of which
the Universe is composed. This curious branch of mathematics, Solid
Geometry, had been pursued with great zeal by Plato and his friends,
and with remarkable success. The five Regular Solids, the Tetrahedron
or regular Triangular Pyramid, the Cube, the Octahedron, the
Dodecahedron, and the Icosahedron, had been discovered; and the
remarkable theorem, that of regular solids there can be just so many,
these and no others, was known. And in the <i>Timæus</i> it is
asserted that the particles of the various elements have the forms of
these solids. Fire has the Pyramid; Earth has the Cube; Water the
Octahedron; Air the Icosahedron; and the Dodecahedron is the plan of
the Universe itself. It was natural that when Plato had learnt that
other mathematical properties had a bearing upon the constitution of
the Universe, he should suppose that the singular property of space,
which the existence of this limited and varied class of solids
implied, should have some corresponding property in the Universe,
which exists in space.</p>
<p>We find afterwards, in Kepler and others, a recurrence to this
assumption; and we may say perhaps that Crystallography shows us that
there are properties of bodies, of the most intimate kind, which
involve such spatial relations as are exhibited in the Regular Solids.
If the distinctions of Crystalline System in bodies were hereafter to
be found to depend upon the chemical elements which predominate in
their composition, the admirers of Plato might point to his doctrine,
of the different form of the particles of the different elements of
the Universe, as a remote Prelude to such a discovery.</p>
<p>But the mathematical doctrines concerning the parts and elements of
the Universe are put forwards by Plato, not so much as assertions
concerning physical facts, of which the truth or falsehood is to be
determined by a reference to nature herself. They are rather
propounded as examples of a truth of a higher kind than any reference
to observation can give or can test, and as revelations of principles
such as must have prevailed in the mind of the Creator of the
Universe; or else as contemplations by which the mind of man is to be
raised above the region of sense, and brought nearer to the Divine
Mind. In the <i>Timæus</i> these doctrines appear rather in the former
of the two lights; as an exposition of the necessary scheme of
creation, so far as its leading features are concerned. In the seventh
Book of the <i>Polity</i>, the same doctrines are regarded more as a
mental discipline; as the necessary study of the true philosopher. But
in both places these mathematical <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page500">500</a></span> propositions are represented as
Realities more real than the Phenomena;&#8212;as a Natural Philosophy
of a higher kind than the study of Nature itself can teach. This is no
doubt an erroneous assumption: yet even in this there is a germ of
truth; namely, that the mathematical laws, which prevail in the
universe, involve mathematical truths  which being demonstrative, are
of a higher and more cogent kind than mere experimental truths.</p>
<p>Notions, such as these of Plato, respecting a truth at which
science is to aim, which is of an exact and demonstrative kind, and is
imperfectly manifested in the phenomena of nature, may help or may
mislead inquirers; they may be the impulse and the occasion to great
discoveries; or they may lead to the assertion of false and the loss
of true doctrines. Plato considers the phenomena which nature offers
to the senses as mere suggestions and rude sketches of the objects
which the philosophic mind is to contemplate. The heavenly bodies and
all the splendors of the sky, though the most beautiful of visible
objects, being only visible objects, are far inferior to the true
objects of which they are the representatives. They are merely
diagrams which may assist in the study of the higher truth  as we
might study geometry by the aid of diagrams constructed by some
consummate artist. Even then, the true object about which we reason is
the conception which we have in the mind.</p>
<p>We have, I conceive, an instance of the error as well as of the
truth, to which such views may lead, in the speculations of Plato
concerning Harmony, contained in that part of his writings (the
seventh Book of the <i>Republic</i>), in which these views are
especially urged. He there, by way of illustrating the superiority of
philosophical truth over such exactness as the senses can attest,
speaks slightingly of those who take immense pains in measuring
musical notes and intervals by the ear, as the astronomers measure the
heavenly motions by the eye. “They screw their pegs and pinch their
strings, and dispute whether two notes are the same or not.” Now, in
truth, the ear is the final and supreme judge whether two notes are
the same or not. But there is a case in which notes which are
nominally the same, are different really and to the ear; and it is
probably to disputes on this subject, which we know did prevail among
the Greek musicians, that Plato here refers. We may ascend from a note
A<sub>1</sub> to a note C<sub>3</sub> by two octaves and a third. We
may also ascend from the same note A<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>3</sub> by
fifths four times repeated. But the two notes C<sub>3</sub> thus
arrived at are not the same: they differ by a small interval, which
the Greeks called a <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page501">501</a></span> Comma, of which the notes are in the
ratio of 80 to 81. That the ear really detects this defect of the
musical coincidence of the two notes under the proper conditions, is a
proof of the coincidence of our musical perceptions with the
mathematical relations of the notes; and is therefore an experimental
confirmation of the mathematical principles of harmony. But it seems
to be represented by Plato, that to look out for such confirmation of
mathematical principles, implies a disposition to lean on the senses,
which he regards as very unphilosophical.</p>
<h4 id="hero"><i>Hero of Alexandria.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> other branches of mathematical science
which I have spoken of in the History as cultivated by the Greeks,
namely Mechanics and Hydrostatics, are not treated expressly by Plato;
though we know from Aristotle and others that some of the propositions
of those sciences were known about his time. Machines moved not only
by weights and springs, but by water and air, were constructed at an
early period. Ctesibius, who lived probably about <span class="sc">b.
c.</span> 250, under the Ptolemies, is said to have invented a
clepsydra or water-clock, and an hydraulic organ; and to have been the
first to discover the elastic power of air, and to apply it as a
moving power. Of his pupil Hero, the name is to this day familiar,
through the little pneumatic instrument called <i>Hero’s Fountain</i>.
He also described pumps and hydraulic machines of various kinds; and
an instrument which has been spoken of by some modern writers as a
<i>steam-engine</i>, but which was merely a toy made to whirl round by
the steam emitted from holes in its arms. Concerning mechanism,
besides descriptions of <i>Automatons</i>, Hero composed two works:
the one entitled <i>Mechanics</i>, or <i>Mechanical Introductions</i>;
the other <i>Barulcos</i>, the <i>Weight-lifter</i>. In these works
the elementary contrivances by which weights may be lifted or drawn
were spoken of as the <i>Five Mechanical Powers</i>, the same
enumeration of such machines as prevails to this day; namely, the
Lever, the Wheel and Axle, the Pulley, the Wedge, and the Screw. In
his Mechanics, it appears that Hero reduced all these machines to one
single machine, namely to the lever. In the <i>Barulcos</i>, Hero
proposed and solved the problem which it was the glory of Archimedes
to have solved: To move any object (however large) by any power
(however small). This, as may easily be conceived by any one
acquainted with the elements of Mechanics, is done by means of a
combination of the mechanical powers, and especially by means of a
train of toothed-wheels and axles. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page502">502</a></span></p>
<p>The remaining writings of Hero of Alexandria have been the subject
of a special, careful, and learned examination by M. Th. H. Martin
(Paris, 1854), in which the works of this writer, Hero the Ancient, as
he is sometimes called, are distinguished from those of another writer
of the same name of later date.</p>
<p>Hero of Alexandria wrote also, as it appears, a treatise on
<i>Pneumatics</i>, in which he described machines, either useful or
amusing, moved by the force of air and vapor.</p>
<p>He also wrote a work called <i>Catoptrics</i>, which contained
proofs of properties of the rays of reflected light.</p>
<p>And a treatise <i>On the Dioptra</i>; which subject however must be
carefully distinguished from the subject entitled <i>Dioptrics</i> by
the moderns. This latter subject treats of the properties of refracted
light; a subject on which the ancients had little exact knowledge till
a later period; as I have <a href="#refraction">shown</a> in the
History. The <i>Dioptra</i>, as understood by Hero, was an instrument
for taking angles so as to measure the position and hence to determine
the distance of inaccessible objects; as is done by the
<i>Theodolite</i> in our times.</p>
<p>M. Martin is of opinion that Hero of Alexandria lived at a later
period than is generally supposed; namely, after <span class="sc">b.

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> mathematical opinions of
Plato respecting the philosophy of nature, and especially respecting
what we commonly call “the heavenly bodies,” the Sun, Moon, and
Planets, were founded upon the view which I have already described:
namely, that it is the business of philosophy to aim at a truth higher
than observation can teach; and to solve problems which the phenomena
of the universe only suggest. And though the students of nature in
more recent times have learnt that this is too presumptuous a notion
of human knowledge, yet the very boldness and hopefulness which it
involved impelled men in the pursuit of truth, with more vigor than a
more timorous temper could have done; and the belief that there must
be, in nature, mathematical laws more exact than experience could
discover, stimulated men often to discover true laws, though often
also to invent false laws. Plato’s writings, supplying examples of
both these processes, belong to the Prelude of true Astronomy, as well
as to the errors of false philosophy. We may find specimens of both
kinds in those parts of his Dialogues to which we have referred in the
<a href="#platotim">preceding</a> Book of our History.</p>
<p>To Plato’s merits in preparing the way for the Theory of Epicycles,
I have already referred in <a href="#v1page138">Chapter ii.</a> of
this Book. I conceive that he had a great share in that which is an
important step in every discovery, the proposing distinctly the
problem to be solved; which was, in this case, as he states it, To
account for the apparent movements of the planets by a combination of
two circular motions for each:&#8212;the motion of identity, and the
motion of difference. (<i>Tim.</i> 39, <span class="sc">a</span>.) In
the tenth Book of the <i>Republic</i>, quoted in our text, the spindle
which Destiny or Necessity holds between her knees, and on which are
rings, by means of which the planets revolve round it as an axis, is a
step towards the conception of the problem, as the construction of a
machine.</p>
<p>It will not be thought surprising that Plato expected that <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page504">504</a></span> Astronomy, when
further advanced, would be able to render an account of many things
for which she has not accounted even to this day. Thus, in the passage
in the seventh Book of the <i>Republic</i>, he says that the
philosopher requires a reason for the proportion of the day to the
month, and the month to the year, deeper and more substantial than
mere observation can give. Yet Astronomy has not yet shown us any
reason why the proportion of the times of the earth’s rotation on its
axis, the moon’s revolution round the earth, and the earth’s
revolution round the sun, might not have been made by the Creator
quite different from what they are. But in thus asking Mathematical
Astronomy for reasons which she cannot give, Plato was only doing what
a great astronomical discoverer, Kepler, did at a later period. One of
the questions which Kepler especially wished to have answered was, why
there are five planets, and why at such particular distances from the
sun? And it is still more curious that he thought he had found the
reason of these things, in the relations of those Five Regular Solids
which, as we have <a href="#v1page499">seen</a>, Plato was desirous of
introducing into the philosophy of the universe. We have Kepler’s
account of this, his imaginary discovery, in the <i>Mysterium
Cosmographicum</i>, published in 1596, as stated in our History, Book
v. Chap. iv. <a href="#b5-4-2">Sect. 2</a>.</p>
<p>Kepler regards the law which thus determines the number and
magnitude of the planetary orbits by means of the five regular solids
as a discovery no less remarkable and certain than the Three Laws
which give his name its imperishable place in the history of
astronomy.</p>
<p>We are not on this account to think that there is no steady
criterion of the difference between imaginary and real discoveries in
science. As discovery becomes possible by the liberty of guessing, it
becomes real by allowing observation constantly and authoritatively to
determine the value of guesses. Kepler added to Plato’s boldness of
fancy his own patient and candid habit of testing his fancies by a
rigorous and laborious comparison with the phenomena; and thus his
discoveries led to those of Newton. <span class="pagenum"><a

<h4 class="five" id="globe"><i>The Globular Form of the
Earth.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THERE</span> are parts of Plato’s
writings which have been adduced as bearing upon the subsequent
progress of science; and especially upon the globular form of the
earth, and the other views which led to the discovery of America. In
the <i>Timæus</i> we read of a great continent lying in the Ocean west
of the Pillars of Hercules, which Plato calls <i>Atlantis</i>. He
makes the personage in his Dialogue who speaks of this put it forward
as an Egyptian tradition. M. H. Martin, who has discussed what has
been written respecting the Atlantis of Plato, and has given therein a
dissertation rich in erudition and of the most lively interest,
conceives that Plato’s notions on this subject arose from his
combining his conviction of the spherical form of the earth, with
interpretations of Homer, and perhaps with traditions which were
current in Egypt (<i>Etudes sur le Timée</i>, Note xiii. § ix.). He
does not consider that the belief in Plato’s Atlantis had any share in
the discoveries of Columbus.</p>
<p>It may perhaps surprise modern readers who have a difficulty in
getting rid of the persuasion that there is a natural direction
<i>upwards</i> and a natural direction <i>downwards</i>, to learn that
both Plato and Aristotle, and of course other philosophers also, had
completely overcome this difficulty. They were quite ready to allow
and to conceive that <i>down</i> meant nothing but towards some
centre, and <i>up</i>, the opposite direction. (Aristotle has,
besides, an ingenious notion that while heavy bodies, as earth and
water, tend to the centre, and light bodies, as fire, tend from the
centre, the fifth element, of which the heavenly bodies are composed,
tends to move <em>round</em> the centre.)</p>
<p>Plato explains this in the most decided manner in the <i>Timæus</i>
(62, <span class="sc">c</span>). “It is quite erroneous to suppose
that there are two opposite regions in the universe, one above and the
other below; and that heavy things naturally tend to the latter place.
The heavens are spherical, and every thing tends to the centre; and
thus <i>above</i> and <i>below</i> have no real meaning. If there be a
solid globe in the middle, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page506">506</a></span> and if a person walk round it, he will
become the antipodes to himself, and the direction which is <i>up</i>
at one time will be <i>down</i> at another.”</p>
<p>The notion of <i>antipodes</i>, the inhabitants of the part of the
globe of the earth opposite to ourselves, was very familiar. Thus in
Cicero’s <i>Academic Questions</i> (ii. 39) one of the speakers says,
“Etiam dicitis esse e regione nobis, e contraria parte terræ, qui
adversis vestigiis stant contra nostra vestigia, quos Antipodas
vocatis.” See also <i>Tusc. Disp.</i> i. 28 and v. 24.</p>
<h4 id="heliocentric"><i>The Heliocentric System among the
Ancients.</i></h4>
<p>As the more clear-sighted of the ancients had overcome the natural
prejudice of believing that there is an absolute <i>up</i> and
<i>down</i>, so had they also overcome the natural prejudice of
believing that the earth is at rest. Cicero says (<i>Acad. Quest.</i>
ii. 39), “Hicetas of Syracuse, as Theophrastus tells us, thinks that
the heavens, the sun, the moon, the stars, do not move; and that
nothing does move but the earth. The earth revolves about her axis
with immense velocity; and thus the same effect is produced as if the
earth were at rest and the heavens moved; and this, he says, Plato
teaches in the <i>Timæus</i>, though somewhat obscurely.” Of course
the assertion that the moon and planets do not move, was meant of the
diurnal motion only. The passage referred to in the <i>Timæus</i>
seems to be this (40, <span class="sc">c</span>)&#8212;“As to the
Earth, which is our nurse, and which <em>clings to</em> the axis which
stretches through the universe, God made her the producer and
preserver of day and night.” The word εἱλλομένην, which I have
translated <i>clings to</i>, some translate <i>revolves</i>; and an
extensive controversy has prevailed, both in ancient and modern times
(beginning with Aristotle), whether Plato did or did not believe in
the rotation of the earth on her axis. (See M. Cousin’s Note on the
<i>Timæus</i>, and M. Henri Martin’s Dissertation, Note xxxvii., in
his <i>Etudes sur le Timée</i>.) The result of this discussion seems
to be that, in the <i>Timæus</i>, the Earth is supposed to be at rest.
It is however related by Plutarch (<i>Platonic Questions</i>, viii.
1), that Plato in his old age repented of having given to the Earth
the place in the centre of the universe which did not belong to
it.</p>
<p>In describing the Prelude to the Epoch of Copernicus (Book v. <a
href="#v1page257">Chap. i.</a>), I have spoken of Philolaus, one of
the followers of Pythagoras, who lived at the time of Socrates, as
having held the doctrine that the earth revolves about the sun. This
has been a current <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page507">507</a></span> opinion;&#8212;so current, indeed, that
the Abbé Bouillaud, or Bullialdus, as we more commonly call him, gave
the title of <i>Philolaus</i> to the defence of Copernicus which he
published in 1639; and Chiaramonti, an Aristotelian, published his
answer under the title of <i>Antiphilolaus</i>. In 1645 Bullialdus
published his <i>Astronomia Philolaica</i>, which was another
exposition of the heliocentric doctrine.</p>
<p>Yet notwithstanding this general belief, it appears to be tolerably
certain that Philolaus did not hold the doctrine of the earth’s motion
round the sun. (M. H. Martin, <i>Etudes sur le Timée</i>, 1841, Note
xxxvii. Sect. i.; and Bœckh, <i>De vera Indole Astronomiæ
Philolaicæ</i>, 1810.) In the system of Philolaus, the earth revolved
about <em>the central fire</em>; but this central fire was not the
sun. The Sun, along with the moon and planets, revolved in circles
external to the earth. The Earth had the <i>Antichthon</i> or
<i>Counter-Earth</i> between it and the centre; and revolving round
this centre in one day, the Antichthon, being always between it and
the centre, was, during a portion of the revolution, interposed
between the Earth and the Sun, and thus made night; while the Sun, by
his proper motion, produced the changes of the year.</p>
<p>When men were willing to suppose the earth to be in motion, in
order to account for the recurrence of day and night, it is curious
that they did not see that the revolution of a spherical earth about
an axis passing through its centre was a scheme both simple and quite
satisfactory. Yet the illumination of a globular earth by a distant
sun, and the circumstances and phenomena thence resulting, appear to
have been conceived in a very confused manner by many persons. Thus
Tacitus (<i>Agric.</i> xii.), after stating that he has heard that in
the northern part of the island of Britain, the night disappears in
the height of summer, says, as his account of this phenomenon, that
“the extreme parts of the earth are low and level, and do not throw
their shadow upwards; so that the shade of night falls below the sky
and the stars.” But, as a little consideration will show, it is the
globular form of the earth, and not the level character of the
country, which produces this effect.</p>
<p>It is not in any degree probable that Pythagoras taught that the
Earth revolves round the Sun, or that it rotates on its own axis. Nor
did Plato hold either of these motions of the Earth. They got so far
as to believe in the Spherical Form of the Earth; and this was
apparently such an effort that the human mind made a pause before
going any further. “It required,” says M. H. Martin, “a great struggle
for <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page508">508</a></span> men to free
themselves from the prejudices of the senses, and to interpret their
testimony in such a manner as to conceive the sphericity of the earth.
It is natural that they should have stopped at this point, before
putting the earth in motion in space.”</p>
<p>Some of the expressions which have been understood, as describing a
system in which the Sun is the <i>centre of motion</i>, do really
imply merely the Sun is the <i>middle term</i> of the series of
heavenly bodies which revolve round the earth: the series being Moon,
Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. This is the case, for
instance, in a passage of Cicero’s <i>Vision of Scipio</i>, which has
been supposed to imply, (as I have <a href="#v1page259">stated</a> in
the History,) that Mercury and Venus revolve about the Sun.</p>
<p>But though the doctrine of the diurnal rotation and annual
revolution of the earth is not the doctrine of Pythagoras, or of
Philolaus, or of Plato, it was nevertheless held by some of the
philosophers of antiquity. The testimony of Archimedes that this
doctrine was held by his contemporary Aristarchus of Samos, is
unquestionable  and there is no reason to doubt Plutarch’s assertion
that Seleucus further enforced it.</p>
<p>It is curious that Copernicus appears not to have known anything of
the opinions of Aristarchus and Seleucus, which were really
anticipations of his doctrine; and to have derived his notion from
passages which, as I have been showing, contain no such doctrine. He
says, in his Dedication to Pope Paul III., “I found in Cicero that
Nicetas [or Hicetas] held that the earth was in motion: and in
Plutarch I found that some others had been of that opinion: and his
words I will transcribe that any one may read them: ‘Philosophers in
general hold that the earth is at rest. But Philolaus the Pythagorean
teaches that it moves round the central fire in an oblique circle, in
the same direction as the Sun and the Moon. Heraclides of Pontus and
Ecphantus the Pythagorean give the earth a motion, but not a motion of
translation; they make it revolve like a wheel about its own centre
from west to east.’” This last opinion was a correct assertion of the
diurnal motion.</p>
<h4><i>The Eclipse of Thales.</i></h4>
<p>“<span class="sc">The</span> Eclipse of Thales” is so remarkable a
point in the history of astronomy, and has been the subject of so much
discussion among astronomers, that it ought to be more especially
noticed. The original <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page509">509</a></span> record is in the first Book of
Herodotus’s History (chap. lxxiv.) He says that there was a war
between the Lydians and the Medes; and after various turns of fortune,
“in the sixth year a conflict took place; and on the battle being
joined, it happened that the day suddenly became night. And this
change, Thales of Miletus had predicted to them, definitely naming
this year, in which the event really took place. The Lydians and the
Medes, when they saw day turned into night, ceased from fighting; and
both sides were desirous of peace.” Probably this prediction was
founded upon the Chaldean period of eighteen years, of which I have
spoken in <a href="#v1page135">Section 11</a>. It is probable, as I
have already said, that this period was discovered by noticing the
recurrence of eclipses. It is to be observed that Thales predicted
only the year of the eclipse, not the day or the month. In fact, the
exact prediction of the circumstances of an eclipse of the sun is a
very difficult problem; much more difficult, it may be remarked, than
the prediction of the circumstance of an eclipse of the moon.</p>
<p>Now that the Theory of the Moon is brought so far towards
completeness, astronomers are able to calculate backwards the eclipses
of the sun which have taken place in former times; and the question
has been much discussed in what year this Eclipse of Thales really
occurred. The Memoir of Mr. Airy, the Astronomer Royal, on this
subject, in the <i>Phil. Trans.</i> for 1853, gives an account of the
modern examinations of this subject. Mr. Airy starts from the
assumption that the eclipse must have been one decidedly total; the
difference between such a one and an eclipse only <em>nearly</em>
total being very marked. A total eclipse alone was likely to produce
so strong an effect on the minds of the combatants. Mr. Airy concludes
from his calculations that the eclipse predicted by Thales took place
<span class="sc">b. c.</span> 585.</p>
<p>Ancient eclipses of the Moon and Sun, if they can be identified,
are of great value for modern astronomy; for in the long interval of
between two and three thousand years which separates them from our
time, those of the <i>inequalities</i>, that is, accelerations or
retardations of the Moon’s motion, which go on increasing
constantly,<a id="fnanchor4-A" href="#note4-A"><span
class="fnanchor">4</span></a> accumulate to a large amount; so that
the actual time and circumstances of the eclipse give astronomers the
means of determining what the rate of these accelerations or
retardations has been. Accordingly Mr. Airy has discussed, as even
more important than the eclipse of Thales, an eclipse which Diodorus
relates to have happened during an expedition of <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page510">510</a></span> Agathocles, the ruler
of Sicily, and which is hence known as the Eclipse of Agathocles. He
determines it to have occurred <span class="sc">b. c.</span> 310.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note4-A"
href="#fnanchor4-A">4</a></span> Or at least for very long
periods.</div>
<p>M. H. Martin, in Note xxxvii. to his <i>Etudes sur le Timée</i>,
discusses among other astronomical matters, the Eclipse of Thales. He
does not appear to render a very cordial belief to the historical fact
of Thales having delivered the prediction before the event. He says
that even if Thales did make such a prediction of an eclipse of the
sun, as he might do, by means of the Chaldean period of 18 years, or
223 lunations, he would have to take the chance of its being visible
in Greece, about which he could only guess:&#8212;that no author
asserts that Thales, or his successors Anaximander and Anaxagoras,
ever tried their luck in the same way again:&#8212;that “en revanche”
we are told that Anaximander predicted an earthquake, and Anaxagoras
the fall of aërolites, which are plainly fabulous stories, though as
well attested as the Eclipse of Thales. He adds that according to
Aristotle, Thales and Anaximenes were so far from having sound notions
of cosmography, that they did not even believe in the roundness of the
earth.</p>

<h3>GENERAL REMARKS.</h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IN</span> the twelfth Book of the
<i>Philosophy</i>, in which I have given a Review of Opinions on the
Nature of Knowledge and the method of seeking it, I have given some
account of several of the most important persons belonging to the ages
now under consideration. I have there (vol. ii. b. xii. p. 146) spoken
of the manner in which remarks made by Aristotle came to be accepted
as fundamental maxims in the schools of the middle ages, and of the
manner in which they were discussed by the greatest of the schoolmen,
as Thomas Aquinas, Albertus Magnus, and the like. I have spoken also
(p. 149) of a certain kind of recognition of the derivation of our
knowledge from experience; as shown in Richard of St. Victor, in the
twelfth century. I have considered (p. 152) the plea of the admirers
of those ages, that religious authority was not claimed for physical
science.</p>
<p>I have noticed that the rise of Experimental Philosophy exhibited
two features (chap. vii. p. 155), the Insurrection against Authority,
and the Appeal to Experience: and as exemplifying these features, I
have spoken of Raymond Lully and of Roger Bacon. I have further
noticed the opposition to the prevailing Aristotelian dogmatism
manifested (chap. viii.) by Nicolas of Cus, Marsilius Ficinus, Francis
Patricius, Picus of Mirandula, Cornelius Agrippa, Theophrastus
Paracelsus, Robert Fludd. I have gone on to notice the Theoretical
Reformers of Science (chap. ix.), Bernardinus Telesius, Thomas
Campanella, Andreas Cæsalpinus, Peter Ramus; and the Protestant
Reformers, as Melancthon. After these come the Practical Reformers of
Science, who have their place in the subsequent history of Inductive
Philosophy; Leonardo da Vinci, and the Heralds of the dawning light of
real science, whom Francis Bacon welcomes, as Heralds are accosted in
Homer:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page512">512</a></span> I have, in
the part of the <i>Philosophy</i> referred to, discussed the merits
and defects of Francis Bacon’s <i>Method</i>, and I shall have
occasion, in the next Book, to speak of his mode of dealing with the
positive science of his time. There is room for much more reflexion on
these subjects, but the references now made may suffice at
present.</p>

<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Thomas Aquinas.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">Aquinas</span> wrote (besides the
<i>Summa</i> <a href="#summa">mentioned</a> in the text) a Commentary
on the Physics of Aristotle: <i>Commentaria in Aristotelis Libros
Physicorum</i>, Venice, 1492. This work is of course of no scientific
value; and the commentary consists of empty permutations of abstract
terms, similar to those which constitute the main substance of the
text in Aristotle’s physical speculations. There is, however, an
attempt to give a more technical form to the propositions and their
demonstrations. As specimens of these, I may mention that in Book vi.
c. 2, we have a demonstration that when bodies move, the time and the
magnitude (that is, the space described), are divided similarly; with
many like propositions. And in Book viii. we have such propositions as
this (c. 10): “Demonstration that a finite mover (<i>movens</i>)
cannot move anything in an infinite time.” This is illustrated by a
diagram in which two hands are represented as engaged in moving a
whole sphere, and one hand in moving a hemisphere.</p>
<p>This mode of representing force, in diagrams illustrative of
mechanical reasonings, by human hands pushing, pulling, and the like,
is still employed in elementary books. Probably this is the first
example of such a mode of representation.</p>
<h4 id="bacon"><i>Roger Bacon.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">This</span> writer, a contemporary of Thomas
Aquinas, exhibits to us a kind of knowledge, speculation, and opinion,
so different from that of any known person near his time, that he
deserves especial notice here; <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page513">513</a></span> and I shall transfer to this place the
account which I have given of him in the <i>Philosophy</i>. I do this
the more willingly because I regard the existence of such a work as
the <i>Opus Majus</i> at that period as a problem which has never yet
been solved. Also I may add, that the scheme of the Contents of this
work which I have given, deserves, as I conceive, more notice than it
has yet received.</p>
<p>“Roger Bacon was born in 1214, near Ilchester, in Somersetshire, of
an old family. In his youth he was a student at Oxford, and made
extraordinary progress in all branches of learning. He then went to
the University of Paris, as was at that time the custom of learned
Englishmen, and there received the degree of Doctor of Theology. At
the persuasion of Robert Grostête, bishop of Lincoln, he entered the
brotherhood of Franciscans in Oxford, and gave himself up to study
with extraordinary fervor. He was termed by his brother monks
<i>Doctor Mirabilis</i>. We know from his own works, as well as from
the traditions concerning him, that he possessed an intimate
acquaintance with all the science of his time which could be acquired
from books; and that he had made many remarkable advances by means of
his own experimental labors. He was acquainted with Arabic, as well as
with the other languages common in his time. In the title of his
works, we find the whole range of science and philosophy, Mathematics
and Mechanics, Optics, Astronomy, Geography, Chronology, Chemistry,
Magic, Music, Medicine, Grammar, Logics, Metaphysics, Ethics, and
Theology; and judging from those which are published, these works are
full of sound and exact knowledge. He is, with good reason, supposed
to have discovered, or to have had some knowledge of, several of the
most remarkable inventions which were made generally known soon
afterwards; as gunpowder, lenses, burning specula, telescopes, clocks,
the correction of the calendar, and the explanation of the
rainbow.</p>
<p>“Thus possessing, in the acquirements and habits of his own mind,
abundant examples of the nature of knowledge and of the process of
invention, Roger Bacon felt also a deep interest in the growth and
progress of science, a spirit of inquiry respecting the causes which
produced or prevented its advance, and a fervent hope and trust in its
future destinies; and these feelings impelled him to speculate
worthily and wisely respecting a Reform of the Method of
Philosophizing. The manuscripts of his works have existed for nearly
six hundred years in many of the libraries of Europe, and especially
in those of England; and for a long period the very imperfect portions
of them which were <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page514">514</a></span> generally known, left the character and
attainments of the author shrouded in a kind of mysterious obscurity.
About a century ago, however, his <i>Opus Majus</i> was published<a
id="fnanchor5-A" href="#note5-A"><span class="fnanchor">5</span></a>
by Dr. S. Jebb, principally from a manuscript in the library of
Trinity College, Dublin; and this contained most or all of the
separate works which were previously known to the public, along with
others still more peculiar and characteristic. We are thus able to
judge of Roger Bacon’s knowledge and of his views, and they are in
every way well worthy our attention.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note5-A"

MS. Codice Dubliniensi cum aliis quibusdam collato nunc primum
edidit</i> S. Jebb, M.D. Londini, 1733.</div>
<p>“The <i>Opus Majus</i> is addressed to Pope Clement the Fourth,
whom Bacon had known when he was legate in England as Cardinal-bishop
of Sabina, and who admired the talents of the monk, and pitied him for
the persecutions to which he was exposed. On his elevation to the
papal chair, this account of Bacon’s labours and views was sent, at
the earnest request of the pontiff. Besides the <i>Opus Majus</i>, he
wrote two others, the <i>Opus Minus</i> and <i>Opus Tertium</i>; which
were also sent to the pope, as the author says,<a id="fnanchor6-A"
href="#note6-A"><span class="fnanchor">6</span></a> ‘on account of the
danger of roads, and the possible loss of the work.’ These works still
exist unpublished, in the Cottonian and other libraries.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note6-A"
href="#fnanchor6-A">6</a></span> <i>Opus Majus</i>, Præf.</div>
<p>“The <i>Opus Majus</i> is a work equally wonderful with regard to
its general scheme, and to the special treatises with which the
outlines of the plan are filled up. The professed object of the work
is to urge the necessity of a reform in the mode of philosophizing, to
set forth the reasons why knowledge had not made a greater progress,
to draw back attention to the sources of knowledge which had been
unwisely neglected, to discover other sources which were yet almost
untouched, and to animate men in the undertaking, by a prospect of the
vast advantages which it offered. In the developement of this plan,
all the leading portions of science are expounded in the most complete
shape which they had at that time assumed; and improvements of a very
wide and striking kind are proposed in some of the principal of these
departments. Even if the work had had no leading purpose, it would
have been highly valuable as a treasure of the most solid knowledge
and soundest speculations of the time; even if it had contained no
such details, it would have been a work most remarkable for its
general views and scope. It may be considered as, at the same time,
the <i>Encyclopedia</i> and the <i>Novum Organon</i> of the thirteenth
century. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page515">515</a></span></p>
<p>“Since this work is thus so important in the history of Inductive
Philosophy I shall give, in a Note, a view<a id="fnanchor7-A"
href="#note7-A"><span class="fnanchor">7</span></a> of its divisions
and contents. But I must now endeavor to point out more especially the
way in which the various principles, which the reform of scientific
method involved, are here brought into view.</p>

<p>“One of the first points to be noticed for this purpose, is the
resistance to authority; and at the stage of philosophical history
with which we here have to do, this means resistance to the authority
of Aristotle, as adopted and interpreted by the Doctors of the
Schools. Bacon’s work<a id="fnanchor8-A" href="#note8-A"><span
class="fnanchor">8</span></a> is divided into Six Parts; and of these
Parts, the First is, Of the four universal Causes of all Human
Ignorance. The causes thus enumerated<a id="fnanchor9-A"
href="#note9-A"><span class="fnanchor">9</span></a> are:&#8212;the
force of unworthy authority;&#8212;traditionary habit;&#8212;the
imperfection of the undisciplined senses;&#8212;and the disposition to
conceal our ignorance and to make an ostentatious show of our
knowledge. These influences involve every man, occupy every condition.
They prevent our obtaining the most useful and large and fair
doctrines of wisdom, the secrets of all sciences and arts. He then
proceeds to argue, from the testimony of philosophers themselves, that
the authority of antiquity, and especially of Aristotle, is not
infallible. ‘We find<a id="fnanchor10-A" href="#note10-A"><span
class="fnanchor">10</span></a> their books full of doubts,
obscurities, and perplexities. They <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page516">516</a></span> scarce agree with each other in one
empty question or one worthless sophism, or one operation of science,
as one man agrees with another in the practical operations of
medicine, surgery, and the like arts of secular men. Indeed,’ he
adds,<a id="fnanchor11-A" href="#note11-A"><span
class="fnanchor">11</span></a> ‘not only the philosophers, but the
saints have fallen into errors which they have afterwards retracted,’
and this he instances in Augustin, Jerome, and others. He gives an
admirable sketch of the progress of philosophy from the Ionic School
to Aristotle; of whom he speaks with great applause. ‘Yet,’ he adds,
‘those who came after him corrected him in some things, and added many
things to his works, and shall go on adding to the end of the world.’
Aristotle, he adds, is now called peculiarly<a id="fnanchor12-A"
href="#note12-A"><span class="fnanchor">12</span></a> the Philosopher,
‘yet there was a time when his philosophy was silent and unregarded,
either on account of the rarity of copies of his works, or their
difficulty, or from envy; till after the time of Mahomet, when
Avicenna and Averroes, and others, recalled this philosophy into the
full light of exposition. And although the Logic and some other works
were translated by Boethius from the Greek, yet the philosophy of
Aristotle first received a quick increase among the Latins at the time
of Michael Scot; who, in the year of our Lord 1230, appeared, bringing
with him portions of the books of Aristotle on Natural Philosophy and
Mathematics. And yet a small part only of the works of this author is
translated, and a still smaller part is in the hands of common
students.’ He adds further<a id="fnanchor13-A" href="#note13-A"><span
class="fnanchor">13</span></a> (in the Third Part of the <i>Opus
Majus</i>, which is a Dissertation on Language) that the translations
which are current of these writings, are very bad and imperfect. With
these views, he is moved to express himself somewhat impatiently<a
id="fnanchor14-A" href="#note14-A"><span
class="fnanchor">14</span></a> respecting these works: ‘If I had,’ he
says, ‘power over the works of Aristotle, I would have them all burnt;
for it is only a loss of time to study in them, and a course of error,
and a multiplication of ignorance beyond expression.’ ‘The common herd
of students,’ he says, ‘with their heads, have no principle by which
they can be excited to any worthy employment; and hence they mope and
make asses of themselves over their bad translations, and lose their
time, and trouble, and money.’</p>

in illis, et causa erroris, et multiplicatio ignorantiæ ultra id quod
valeat explicari. . . . Vulgus studentum cum capitibus suis non habet

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page517">517</a></span> “The
remedies which he recommends for these evils, are, in the first place,
the study of that only perfect wisdom which is to be found in the

href="#note16-A"><span class="fnanchor">16</span></a> By the aid of
these methods, Bacon anticipates the most splendid progress for human
knowledge. He takes up the strain of hope and confidence which we have
noticed as so peculiar in the Roman writers; and quotes some of the
passages of Seneca which we adduced in illustration of
this:&#8212;that the attempts in science were at first rude and
imperfect, and were afterwards improved;&#8212;that the day will come,
when what is still unknown shall be brought to light by the progress
of time and the labors of a longer period;&#8212;that one age does not
suffice for inquiries so wide and various;&#8212;that the people of
future times shall know many things unknown to us;&#8212;and that the
time shall arrive when posterity will wonder that we overlooked what
was so obvious. Bacon himself adds anticipations more peculiarly in
the spirit of his own time. ‘We have seen,’ he says, at the end of the
work, ‘how Aristotle, by the ways which wisdom teaches, could give to
Alexander the empire of the world. And this the Church ought to take
into consideration against the infidels and rebels, that there may be
a sparing of Christian blood, and especially on account of the
troubles that shall come to pass in the days of Antichrist; which by
the grace of God it would be easy to obviate, if prelates and princes
would encourage study, and join in searching out the secrets of nature
and art.’</p>

<p>“It may not be improper to observe here that this belief in the
appointed progress of knowledge, is not combined with any overweening
belief in the unbounded and independent power of the human intellect.
On the contrary, one of the lessons which Bacon draws from the state
and prospects of knowledge, is the duty of faith and humility. ‘To
him,’ he says,<a id="fnanchor17-A" href="#note17-A"><span
class="fnanchor">17</span></a> ‘who denies the truth of the faith
because he is unable to understand it, I will propose in reply the
course of nature, and as we have seen it in examples.’ And after
giving some instances, he adds, ‘These, and the like, ought to move
men and to excite them to the reception of divine truths. For if, in
the vilest objects of creation, truths are found, before which the
inward pride of man must bow, and believe though it cannot understand,
how much more should man humble his mind before the glorious truths of
God!’ He had before said:<a id="fnanchor18-A" href="#note18-A"><span
class="fnanchor">18</span></a> ‘Man is incapable of perfect wisdom in
this life; it is hard for <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page518">518</a></span> him to ascend towards perfection, easy
to glide downwards to falsehoods and vanities: let him then not boast
of his wisdom, or extol his knowledge. What he knows is little and
worthless, in respect of that which he believes without knowing; and
still less, in respect of that which he is ignorant of. He is mad who
thinks highly of his wisdom; he most mad, who exhibits it as something
to be wondered at.’ He adds, as another reason for humility, that he
has proved by trial, he could teach in one year, to a poor boy, the
marrow of all that the most diligent person could acquire in forty
years’ laborious and expensive study.</p>

<p>“To proceed somewhat more in detail with regard to Roger Bacon’s
views of a Reform in Scientific Inquiry, we may observe that by making
Mathematics and Experiment the two great points of his recommendation,
he directed his improvement to the two essential parts of all
knowledge, Ideas and Facts, and thus took the course which the most
enlightened philosophy would have suggested. He did not urge the
prosecution of experiment, to the comparative neglect of the existing
mathematical sciences and conceptions; a fault which there is some
ground for ascribing to his great namesake and successor Francis
Bacon: still less did he content himself with a mere protest against
the authority of the schools, and a vague demand for change, which was
almost all that was done by those who put themselves forward as
reformers in the intermediate time. Roger Bacon holds his way steadily
between the two poles of human knowledge; which, as we have seen, it
is far from easy to do. ‘There are two modes of knowing,’ says he;<a
id="fnanchor19-A" href="#note19-A"><span
class="fnanchor">19</span></a> ‘by argument, and by experiment.
Argument concludes a question; but it does not make us feel certain,
or acquiesce in the contemplation of truth, except the truth be also
found to be so by experience.’ It is not easy to express more
decidedly the clearly-seen union of exact conceptions with certain
facts, which, as we have explained, constitutes real knowledge.</p>

448. “Scientiæ aliæ sciunt sua principia invenire per experimenta, sed
conclusiones per argumenta facta ex principiis inventis. Si vero
debeant habere experientiam conclusionum suarum particularem et
completam, tunc oportet quod habeant per adjutorium istius scientiæ
nobilis (experimentalis).”</div>
<p>“One large division of the <i>Opus Majus</i> is ‘On the Usefulness
of Mathematics,’ which is shown by a copious enumeration of existing
branches of knowledge, as Chronology, Geography, the Calendar and (in
a separate Part) Optics. There is a chapter,<a id="fnanchor20-A"
href="#note20-A"><span class="fnanchor">20</span></a> in which it is
proved <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page519">519</a></span> by
reason, that all science requires mathematics. And the arguments which
are used to establish this doctrine, show a most just appreciation of
the office of mathematics in science. They are such as
follows:&#8212;That other sciences use examples taken from mathematics
as the most evident:&#8212;That mathematical knowledge is, as it were,
innate to us, on which point he refers to the well-known dialogue of
Plato, as quoted by Cicero:&#8212;That this science, being the
easiest, offers the best introduction to the more
difficult:&#8212;That in mathematics, things as known to us are
identical with things as known to nature:&#8212;That we can here
entirely avoid doubt and error, and obtain certainty and
truth:&#8212;That mathematics is prior to other sciences in nature,
because it takes cognizance of quantity, which is apprehended by
intuition (<i>intuitu intellectus</i>). ‘Moreover,’ he adds,<a
id="fnanchor21-A" href="#note21-A"><span
class="fnanchor">21</span></a> ‘there have been found famous men, as
Robert, bishop of Lincoln, and Brother Adam Marshman (de Marisco), and
many others, who by the power of mathematics have been able to explain
the causes of things; as may be seen in the writings of these men, for
instance, concerning the Rainbow and Comets, and the generation of
heat, and climates, and the celestial bodies.’</p>

<p>“But undoubtedly the most remarkable portion of the <i>Opus
Majus</i> is the Sixth and last Part, which is entitled ‘De Scientia
experimentali.’ It is indeed an extraordinary circumstance to find a
writer of the thirteenth century, not only recognizing experiment as
one source of knowledge, but urging its claims as something far more
important than men had yet been aware of, exemplifying its value by
striking and just examples, and speaking of its authority with a
dignity of diction which sounds like a foremurmur of the Baconian
sentences uttered nearly four hundred years later. Yet this is the
character of what we here find.<a id="fnanchor22-A"
href="#note22-A"><span class="fnanchor">22</span></a> ‘Experimental
science, the sole mistress of speculative sciences, has three great
Prerogatives among other parts of knowledge: First she tests by
experiment the noblest conclusions of all other sciences: Next she
discovers respecting the notions which other sciences deal with,
magnificent truths to which these sciences of themselves can by no
means attain: her Third dignity is, that she by her own power and
without respect of other sciences, investigates the secrets of
nature.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page520">520</a></span> “The
examples which Bacon gives of these ‘Prerogatives’ are very curious,
exhibiting, among some error and credulity, sound and clear views. His
leading example of the First Prerogative is the Rainbow, of which the
cause, as given by Aristotle, is tested by reference to experiment
with a skill which is, even to us now, truly admirable. The examples
of the Second Prerogative are three&#8212;<i>first</i>, the art of
making an artificial sphere which shall move with the heavens by
natural influences, which Bacon trusts may be done, though astronomy
herself cannot do it&#8212;’et tunc,’ he says, ‘thesaurum unius regis
valeret hoc instrumentum;’&#8212;<i>secondly</i>, the art of
prolonging life, which experiment may teach, though medicine has no
means of securing it except by regimen;<a id="fnanchor23-A"
href="#note23-A"><span
class="fnanchor">23</span></a>&#8212;<i>thirdly</i>, the art of making
gold finer than fine gold, which goes beyond the power of alchemy. The
Third Prerogative of experimental science, arts independent of the
received sciences, is exemplified in many curious examples, many of
them whimsical traditions. Thus it is said that the character of a
people may be altered by altering the air.<a id="fnanchor24-A"
href="#note24-A"><span class="fnanchor">24</span></a> Alexander, it
seems, applied to Aristotle to know whether he should exterminate
certain nations which he had discovered, as being irreclaimably
barbarous; to which the philosopher replied, ‘If you can alter their
air, permit them to live; if not, put them to death.’ In this part, we
find the suggestion that the fire-works made by children, of
saltpetre, might lead to the invention of a formidable military
weapon.</p>

food cannot fail to amuse the reader. “Where there are good flying
dragons, by the art which they possess, they draw them out of their
dens, and have bridles and saddles in readiness, and they ride upon
them, and make them bound about in the air in a violent manner, that
the hardness and toughness of the flesh may be reduced, as boars are
hunted and bulls are baited before they are killed for

<p>“It could not be expected that Roger Bacon, at a time when
experimental science hardly existed, could give any <em>precepts</em>
for the discovery of truth by experiment. But nothing can be a better
<em>example</em> of the method of such investigation, than his inquiry
concerning the cause of the Rainbow. Neither Aristotle, nor Avicenna,
nor Seneca, he says, have given us any clear knowledge of this matter,
but experimental science can do so. Let the experimenter
(<i>experimentator</i>) consider the cases in which he finds the same
colors, as the hexagonal crystals from Ireland and India; by looking
into these he will see colors like those of the rainbow. Many think
that this arises from some <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page521">521</a></span> special virtue of these stones and their
hexagonal figure; let therefore the experimenter go on, and he will
find the same in other transparent stones, in dark ones as well as in
light-colored. He will find the same effect also in other forms than
the hexagon, if they be furrowed in the surface, as the Irish crystals
are. Let him consider too, that he sees the same colors in the drops
which are dashed from oars in the sunshine;&#8212;and in the spray
thrown by a mill wheel;&#8212;and in the dew drops which lie on the
grass in a meadow on a summer morning;&#8212;and if a man takes water
in his mouth and projects it on one side into a sunbeam;&#8212;and if
in an oil lamp hanging in the air, the rays fall in certain positions
upon the surface of the oil;&#8212;and in many other ways, are colors
produced. We have here a collection of instances, which are almost all
examples of the same kind as the phenomenon under consideration; and
by the help of a principle collected by induction from these facts,
the colors of the rainbow were afterwards really explained.</p>
<p>“With regard to the form and other circumstances of the bow he is
still more precise. He bids us measure the height of the bow and of
the sun, to show that the centre of the bow is exactly opposite to the
sun. He explains the circular form of the bow,&#8212;its being
independent of the form of the cloud, its moving when we move, its
flying when we follow,&#8212;by its consisting of the reflections from
a vast number of minute drops. He does not, indeed, trace the course
of the rays through the drop, or account for the precise magnitude
which the bow assumes; but he approaches to the verge of this part of
the explanation; and must be considered as having given a most happy
example of experimental inquiry into nature, at a time when such
examples were exceedingly scanty. In this respect, he was more
fortunate than Francis Bacon, as we shall <a
href="#v1page531">hereafter</a> see.</p>
<p>“We know but little of the biography of Roger Bacon, but we have
every reason to believe that his influence upon his age was not great.
He was suspected of magic, and is said to have been put into close
confinement in consequence of this charge. In his work he speaks of
Astrology, as a science well worth cultivating. ‘But,’ says he,
‘Theologians and Decretists, not being learned in such matters, and
seeing that evil as well as good may be done, neglect and abhor such
things, and reckon them among Magic Arts.’ We have already seen, that
at the very time when Bacon was thus raising his voice against the
habit of blindly following authority, and seeking for all science in
Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas was employed in fashioning Aristotle’s
tenets into that fixed form in which they became the great impediment
to the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page522">522</a></span> progress
of knowledge. It would seem, indeed, that something of a struggle
between the progressive and stationary powers of the human mind was
going on at this time. Bacon himself says,<a id="fnanchor25-A"
href="#note25-A"><span class="fnanchor">25</span></a> ‘Never was there
so great an appearance of wisdom, nor so much exercise of study in so
many Faculties, in so many regions, as for this last forty years.
Doctors are dispersed everywhere, in every castle, in every burgh, and
especially by the students of two Orders, (he means the Franciscans
and Dominicans, who were almost the only religious orders that
distinguished themselves by an application to study,<a
id="fnanchor26-A" href="#note26-A"><span
class="fnanchor">26</span></a>) which has not happened except for
about forty years. And yet there was never so much ignorance, so much
error.’ And in the part of his work which refers to Mathematics, he
says of that study,<a id="fnanchor27-A" href="#note27-A"><span
class="fnanchor">27</span></a> that it is the door and the key of the
sciences; and that the neglect of it for thirty or forty years has
entirely ruined the studies of the Latins. According to these
statements, some change, disastrous to the fortunes of science, must
have taken place about 1230, soon after the foundation of the
Dominican and Franciscan Orders.<a id="fnanchor28-A"
href="#note28-A"><span class="fnanchor">28</span></a> Nor can we doubt
that the adoption of the Aristotelian philosophy by these two Orders,
in the form in which the Angelical Doctor had systematized it, was one
of the events which most tended to defer, for three centuries, the
reform which Roger Bacon urged as a matter of crying necessity in his
own time.”</p>

Bacon, as afterwards in the <i>Novum Organon</i> of Francis Bacon, we
have certain features of experimental research pointed out
conspicuously as <i>Prærogativæ</i>: although in the former, this term

<p class="drop end"><span class="sc">I WILL</span> quote the passage, in
the writings of this author, which bears upon the subject in question.
I translate it from the edition of his book <i>De Docta
Ignorantia</i>, from his works published at Basil in 1565. He praises
<em>Learned Ignorance</em>&#8212;that is, Acknowledged
Ignorance&#8212;as the source of knowledge. His ground for asserting
the motions of the earth is, that there is no such thing as perfect
rest, or an exact centre, or a perfect circle, nor perfect uniformity
of motion. “Neque verus circulus dabilis est, quinetiam verior dari
possit, neque unquam uno tempore sicut alio æqualiter præcisè, aut
movetur, aut circulum veri similem, æqualem describit, etiamsi nobis
hoc non appareat. Et ubicumque quis fuerit, se in centro esse credit.”
(Lib. i. cap. xi. p. 39.) He adds, “The Ancients did not attain to
this knowledge, because they were wanting in Learned Ignorance. Now it
is manifest to us that the Earth is truly in motion, although this do
not appear to us; since we do not apprehend motion except by
comparison with something fixed. For if any one were in a boat in the
middle of a river, ignorant that the water was flowing, and not seeing
the banks, how could he apprehend that the boat was moving? And thus
since every one, whether he be in the Earth, or in the Sun, or in any
other star, thinks that he is in an immovable centre, and that
everything else is moving; he would assign different poles for
himself, others as being in the Sun, others in the Earth, and others
in the Moon, and so of the rest. Whence the machine of the world is as
if it had its centre everywhere and its circumference nowhere.” This
train of thought <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page524">524</a></span> might be a preparation for the reception
of the Copernican system; but it is very different from the doctrine
that the Sun is the centre of the Planetary Motions.</p>

<h4 class="five"><i>The Moon’s Rotation.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">I HAVE</span> said, in <a
href="#v1page264">page 264</a>, that a confusion of mind produced by
the double reference of motion to absolute space, and to a centre of
revolution, often leads persons to dispute whether the Moon, while she
revolves about the Earth, always turning to it the same face, revolves
about her axis or not.</p>
<p>This dispute has been revived very lately, and has been conducted
in a manner which shows that popular readers and writers have made
little progress in the clearness of their notions during the last two
or three centuries; and that they have accepted the Newtonian
doctrines in words with a very dim apprehension of their real
import.</p>
<p>If the Moon were carried round the Earth by a rigid arm revolving
about the Earth as a centre, being rigidly fastened to this arm, as a
mimic Moon might be, in a machine constructed to represent her
motions, this contrivance, while it made her revolve round the Earth
would make her also turn the same face to the Earth: and if we were to
make such a machine the standard example of rotation, the Moon might
be said not to rotate on her axis.</p>
<p>But we are speedily led to endless confusion by taking this case as
the standard of rotation. For the selection of the centre of rotation
in a system which includes several bodies is arbitrary. The Moon turns
all her faces successively to the Sun, and therefore with regard to
the Sun, she does rotate on her axis; and yet she revolves round the
Sun as truly as she revolves round the Earth. And the only really
simple and consistent mode of speaking of rotation, is to refer the
motion not to any relative centre, but to absolute space.</p>
<p>This is the argument merely on the ground of simplicity and
consistency. But we find physical reasons, as well as mathematical,
for referring the motion to absolute space. If a cup of water be
carried round a centre so as to describe a circle, a straw floating on
the surface <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page525">525</a></span> of
the water, if it point to the centre of the circle at first, does not
continue to do so, but remains parallel to itself during the whole
revolution. Now there is no cause to make the water (and therefore the
straw) rotate on its axis; and therefore it is not a clear or
convenient way of speaking, to say that the water in this case does
revolve on its axis. But if the water in this case do not revolve on
its axis, a body in the case of the Moon does revolve on its axis.</p>
<p>The difficulty, as I have said in the text, is of the same nature
as that which the Copernicans at first found in the parallel motion of
the Earth’s axis. In order to make the axis of the Earth’s rotation
remain parallel to itself while the Earth revolves about the Sun, in a
mechanical representation, some machinery is needed <em>in
addition</em> to the machinery which produces the revolution round the
centre (the Sun): but the simplest way of regarding the parallel
motion is, to conceive that the axis has no motion except that which
carries it round the central Sun. And it was seen, when the science of
Mechanics was established, that no force was needed in nature to
produce this parallelism of the Earth’s axis. It was therefore the
only scientific course, to conceive this parallelism as not being a
rotation: and in like manner we are to conceive the parallelism of a
revolving body as not being a rotation.</p>
<h4><i>M. Foucault’s Proofs of the Earth’s Motion.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">It</span> was hardly to be expected that we should
discover, in our own day, a new physical proof of the earth’s motion,
yet so it has been. The experiments of M. Foucault have enabled us to
see the Rotation of the Earth on its axis, as taking place, we may
say, before our eyes. These experiments are, in fact, a result of what
has been said in speaking of the Moon’s rotation: namely, That the
mechanical causes of motion operate with reference to absolute, not
relative, space; so that where there is no cause operating to change a
motion, it will retain its direction in <em>absolute</em> space; and
may on that account seem to change, if regarded relatively in a
<em>limited</em> space.</p>
<p>In M. Foucault’s first experiment, the motion employed was that of
a pendulum. If a pendulum oscillate quite freely, there is no cause
acting to change the vertical plane of oscillation
<em>absolutely</em>; for the forces which produce the oscillation are
<em>in</em> the vertical plane. But if the vertical plane remain the
same <em>absolutely</em>, at a spot on the surface of the revolving
Earth, it will change <em>relatively</em> to the spectator. He will
see the pendulum oscillate in a vertical plane which gradually <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page526">526</a></span> turns away from its
first position. Now this is what really happens; and thus the
revolution of the Earth in absolute space is experimentally
proved.</p>
<p>In subsequent experiments, M. Foucault has used the rotation of a
body to prove the same thing. For when a body rotates freely, acted
upon by no power, there is nothing to change the position of the axis
of rotation in absolute space. But if the position of the axis remain
the same in absolute space, it will, in virtue of its relative motion,
change as seen by a spectator at any spot on the rotating Earth. By
taking a heavy disk or globe and making it rotate on its axis rapidly,
the force of absolute permanence (as compared with the inevitable
casual disturbances arising from the machinery which supports the
revolving disk) becomes considerable  and hence the relative motion
can, in this way also, be made visible.</p>
<p>Mr. De Morgan has said (<i>Comp. to Brit. Alm.</i> 1836, p. 18)
that astronomy does not supply any argument for the earth’s motion
which is absolutely and demonstrably conclusive, till we come to the
Aberration of Light. But we may now venture to say that the
experiments of M. Foucault prove the diurnal motion of the Earth in
the most conclusive manner, by palpable and broad effects, if we
accept the doctrines of the Science of Mechanics: while Aberration
proves the annual motion, if we suppose that we can observe the places
of the fixed stars to the accuracy of a few seconds; and if we accept,
in addition to the doctrines of Mechanics, the doctrine of the motion
of light with a certain great velocity.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br /><br />
<span class="sc space">Sequel to Copernicus.</span></h3>
<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>English Copernicans.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR DE MORGAN</span>  has made
numerous and interesting contributions to the history of the progress
and reception of the Copernican System. These are given mainly in the
<i>Companion to the British Almanac</i>; especially in his papers
entitled “Old Arguments against the Motion of the Earth” (1836);
“English Mathematical and Astronomical Writers” (1837); “On the
Difficulty of Correct <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page527">527</a></span> Description of Books” (1853); “The
Progress of the Doctrine of the Earth’s Motion between the Times of
Copernicus and Galileo” (1855). In these papers he insists very
rightly upon the distinction between the <em>mathematical</em> and the
<em>physical</em> aspect of the doctrines of Copernicus: a distinction
corresponding very nearly with the distinction which we have drawn
between Formal and Physical Astronomy; and in accordance with which we
have given the history of the Heliocentric Doctrine as a Formal Theory
in <a href="#v1page253">Book v.</a>, and as a Physical Theory in <a
href="#v1page383">Book vii.</a></p>
<p>Another interesting part of Mr. De Morgan’s researches are the
notices which he has given of the early assertors of the heliocentric
doctrine in England. These make their appearance as soon as it was
well possible they should exist. The work of Copernicus was published,
as we have said, in 1543. In September 1556, John Field published an
Ephemeris for 1557, “juxta Copernici et Reinholdi Canones,” in the
preface to which he avows his conviction of the truth of the
Copernican hypothesis. Robert Recorde, the author of various works on
Arithmetic, published among others, “The Pathway to Knowledge” in
1551. In this book, the author discusses the question of the “quietnes
of the earth,” and professes to leave it undecided: but Mr. De Morgan
(<i>Comp. A.</i> 1837, p. 33) conceives that it appears from what is
said, that he was really a Copernican, but did not think the world
ripe for any such doctrine.</p>
<p>Mr. Joseph Hunter also has brought to notice<a id="fnanchor29-A"
href="#note29-A"><span class="fnanchor">29</span></a> the claims of
Field, whom he designates as the <i>Proto-Copernican</i> of England.
He quotes the Address to the Reader prefixed to his first
<i>Ephemeris</i>, and dated May 31, 1556, in which he says that, since
abler men decline the task, “I have therefore published this Ephemeris
of the year 1557, following in it as my authorities, N. Copernicus and
Erasmus Reinhold, whose writings are established and founded on true,
certain, and authentic demonstrations.” I conceive that this passage,
however, only shows that Field had adopted the Copernican scheme as a
basis for the calculation of Ephemerides; which, as Mr. De Morgan has
remarked, is a very different thing from accepting it as a physical
truth. Field, in this same address, makes mention of the errors
“illius turbæ quæ Alphonsi utitur hypothesi;” but the word
<i>hypothesis</i> is still indecisive.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note29-A"
href="#fnanchor29-A">29</a></span> <i>Ast. Soc. Notices</i>, vol. iii.
p. 3 (1833).</div>
<p>As evidence that Field was regarded in his own day as a man who
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page528">528</a></span> had rendered
good service to science, Mr. Hunter notices that, in 1558, the Heralds
granted to him the right of using, with his arms, the crest or
additional device of a red right arm issuing from the clouds, and
presenting a golden armillary sphere.</p>
<p>Recorde’s claims depend upon a passage in a Dialogue between
<i>Master</i> and <i>Scholar</i>, in which the Master expounds the
doctrine of Copernicus, and the authorities against it; to which the
Scholar answers, taking the common view: “Nay, sir, in good faith I
desire not to hear such vaine phantasies, so far against common
reason, and repugnant to all the learned multitude of wryters, and
therefore let it passe for ever and a day longer.” The Master, more
sagely, warns him against a hasty judgment, and says, “Another time I
will so declare his supposition, that you shall not only wonder to
hear it, but also peradventure be as earnest then to credit it, as you
now are now to condemne it.” I conceive that this passage proves Mr.
De Morgan’s assertion, that Recorde was a Copernican, and very likely
the first in England.</p>
<p>In 1555, also, Leonard Digges published his “Prognostication
Everlasting;” but this is, as Mr. De Morgan says (<i>Comp. A.</i>
1837, p. 40) a meteorological work. It was republished in 1592 by his
son Thomas Digges with additions; and as these have been the occasion
of some confusion among those who have written on the history of
astronomy, I am glad to be able, through the kindness of Professor
Walker of Oxford, to give a distinct account of the editions of the
work.</p>
<p>In the Bodleian Library, besides the editions of 1555 and 1592 of
the “Prognostication Everlasting,” there is an edition of 1564. It is
still decidedly Ptolemaic, and contains a Diagram representing a
number of concentric circles, which are marked, in order, as&#8212;<br />
&#8195;“The Earth,<br />
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Moone,<br />
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Venus,<br />
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Mercury,<br />

&#8195;The Abode of God and the Elect. Here the Learned do approve.”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page529">529</a></span></p>
<p>The third edition, of 1592, contains an Addition, by the son, of
twenty pages. He there speaks of having found, apparently among his
father’s papers, “A description or modile of the world and situation
of Spheres Cœlestiall and elementare according to the doctrine of
Ptolemie, whereunto all universities (led thereunto chiefly by the
authoritie of Aristotle) do consent.” He adds: “But in this our age,
one rare witte (seeing the continuall errors that from time to time
more and more continually have been discovered, besides the infinite
absurdities in their Theoricks, which they have been forced to admit
that would not confesse any Mobilitie in the ball of the Earth) hath
by long studye, paynfull practise, and rare invention, delivered a new
Theorick or Model of the world, shewing that the Earth resteth not in
the Center of the whole world or globe of elements, which encircled
and enclosed in the Moone’s orbe, and together with the whole globe of
mortalitye is carried yearely round about the Sunne, which like a king
in the middest of all, raygneth and giveth lawes of motion to all the
rest, sphærically dispersing his glorious beames of light through all
this sacred cœlestiall Temple. And the Earth itselfe to be one of the
Planets, having his peculiar and strange courses, turning every 24
hours rounde upon his owne centre, whereby the Sunne and great globe
of fixed Starres seem to sway about and turne, albeit indeed they
remaine fixed&#8212;So many ways is the sense of mortal man
abused.”</p>
<p>This Addition is headed:<br />
&#8195;“A Perfit Description of the Cœlestiall Orbes, according to the
most ancient doctrine of the Pythagoreans: lately revived by
Copernicus, and by Geometrical Demonstrations approved.” Mr. De
Morgan, not having seen this edition, and knowing the title-page only
as far as the word “Pythagoreans,” says “their <em>astrological</em>
doctrines we presume, not their reputed <em>Copernican</em> ones.” But
it now appears that in this, as in other cases, the authority of the
Pythagoreans was claimed for the Copernican system. Antony a Wood
quotes the latter part of the title thus: “Cui subnectitur
<i>orbium</i> Copernicarum accurata descriptio;” which is inaccurate.
Weidler, still more inaccurately, cites it, “Cui subnectitur
<i>operum</i> Copernici accurata descriptio.” Lalande goes still
further, attempting, it would seem, to recover the English title-page
from the Latin: we find in the <i>Bibl. Astron.</i> the following:
“1592 . . Leonard Digges, Accurate Description of the Copernican
System to the Astronomical perpetual Prognostication.”</p>
<p>Thomas Digges appears, by others also of his writings, to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page530">530</a></span> a clear and
decided Copernican. In his “Alæ sive Scalæ Mathematicæ,” 1573, he
bestows high praise upon Copernicus and upon his system: and appears
to have been a believer in the real motion of the Earth, and not
merely an admirer of the system of Copernicus as an explanatory
hypothesis.</p>
<h4 id="bruno"><i>Giordano Bruno.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> complete title of the work referred to
is:<br />
&#8195;“Jordani Bruni Nolani De Monade Numero et Figura liber
consequens Quinque De Minimo Magno et Mensura, item De
Innumerabilibus, Immenso et Infigurabili; seu De Universo et Mundis
libri octo. (Francofurti, 1591.)”</p>
<p>That the Reader may judge of the value of Bruno’s speculations, I
give the following quotations:</p>
<p>Lib. iv. c. 11 (Index). “Tellurem totam habitabilem esse
<em>intus</em> et extra, et innumerabilia animantium complecti tum
nobis sensibilium tum <em>occultorum</em> genera.”</p>
<p>C. 13. “Ut Mundorum Synodi in Universo et particulares Mundi in
Synodis ordinentur,’ &amp;c.</p>
<p>He says (Lib. v. c. 1, p. 461): “Besides the stars and the great
worlds there are smaller living creatures carried through the etherial
space, in the form of a small sphere which has the aspect of a bright
fire, and is by the vulgar regarded as a fiery beam. They are below
the clouds, and I saw one which seemed to touch the roofs of the
houses. Now this sphere, or beam as they call it, was really a living
creature (<i>animal</i>), which I once saw moving in a straight path,
and grazing as it were the roofs of the city of Nola, as if it were
going to impinge on Mount Cicada; which however it went over.”</p>
<p>There are two recent editions of the works of Giordano Bruno; by
Adolf Wagner, Leipsick, 1830, in two volumes; and by Gfrörer, Berlin,
1833. Of the latter I do not know that more than one volume (vol. ii.)
has appeared.</p>
<h4><i>Did Francis Bacon reject the Copernican System?</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">Mr. De Morgan</span> has very properly remarked
(<i>Comp. B. A.</i> 1855, p. 11) that the notice of the heliocentric
question in the <i>Novum Organon</i> must be considered one of the
most important passages in his works upon this point, as being
probably the latest written and best <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page531">531</a></span> matured. It occurs in Lib. ii. Aphorism
xxxvi., in which he is speaking of <i>Prerogative Instances</i>, of
which he gives twenty-seven species. In the passage now referred to,
he is speaking of a kind of Prerogative Instances, better known to
ordinary readers than most of the kinds by name, the <i>Instantia
Crucis</i>: though probably the metaphor from which this name is
derived is commonly wrongly apprehended. Bacon’s meaning is
<i>Guide-Post Instances</i>: and the <i>Crux</i> which he alludes to
is not a Cross, but a Guide-Post at Cross-roads. And among the cases
to which such Instances may be applied, he mentions the diurnal motion
of the heavens from east to west, and the special motion of the
particular heavenly bodies from west to east. And he suggests what he
conceives may be an <i>Instantia Crucis</i> in each case. If, he says,
we find any motion from east to west in the bodies which surround the
earth, slow in the ocean, quicker in the air, quicker still in comets,
gradually quicker in planets according to their greater distance from
the earth: <em>then</em> we may suppose that there is a cosmical
diurnal motion, and the motion of the earth must be denied.</p>
<p>With regard to the special motions of the heavenly bodies, he first
remarks that each body not coming quite so far westwards as before,
after one revolution of the heavens, and going to the north or the
south, does not imply any special motion; since it may be accounted
for by a modification of the diurnal motion in each, which produces a
defect of the return, and a spiral path; and he says that if we look
at the matter as common people<a id="fnanchor30-A"
href="#note30-A"><span class="fnanchor">30</span></a> and disregard
the devices of astronomers, the motion is really so to the senses; and
that he has made an imitation of it by means of wires. The
<i>instantia crucis</i> which he here suggests is, to see if we can
find in any credible history an account of any comet which did not
share in the diurnal revolution of the skies.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note30-A"
href="#fnanchor30-A">30</a></span> Et certissimum est si paulisper pro
plebeiis nos geramus (missis astronomorum et scholæ commentis, quibus
illud in more est, ut sensui in multis immerito vim faciant et
obscuriora malint) talem esse motum istum ad sensum qualem
diximus.</div>
<p>On his assertion that the motion of each separate planet is, to
sense, a spiral, we may remark that it is certainly true; but that the
business of science, here, as elsewhere, consists in
<em>resolving</em> the complex phenomenon into simple phenomena; the
complex spiral motion into simple circular motions.</p>
<p>With regard to the diurnal motion of the earth, it would seem as if
Bacon himself had a leaning to believe it when he wrote this passage;
for neither is he himself, nor are any of the Anticopernicans, <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page532">532</a></span> accustomed to assert
that the immensely rapid motion of the sphere of the Fixed Stars
graduates by a slower and slower motion of Planets, Comets, Air, and
Ocean, into the immobility of the Earth. So that the conditions are
not satisfied on which he hypothetically says, “tum abnegandus est
motus terræ.”</p>
<p>With regard to the proper motions of the planets, this passage
seems to me to confirm what I have already said of him; that he does
not appear to have seen the full value and meaning of what had been
done, up to his time, in Formal Astronomy.</p>
<p>We may however fully agree with Mr. De Morgan; that the whole of
what he has said on this subject, when put together, does not justify
Hume’s assertion that he rejected the Copernican system “with the most
positive disdain.”</p>
<p>Mr. De Morgan, in order to balance the Copernican argument derived
from the immense velocity of the stars in their diurnal velocity on
the other supposition, has reminded us that those who reject this
great velocity as improbable, accept without scruple the greater
velocity of light. It is curious that Bacon also has made this
comparison, though using it for a different purpose; namely, to show
that the transmission of the visual impression may be instantaneous.
In Aphorism xlvi. of Book ii. of the <i>Novum Organon</i> he is
speaking of what he calls <i>Instantiæ curriculi</i>, or <i>Instantiæ
ad aquam</i>, which we may call <i>Instances by the clock</i>: and he
says that the great velocity of the diurnal sphere makes the
marvellous velocity of the rays of light more credible.</p>
<p>“Immensa illa velocitas in ipso corpore, quæ cernitur in motu
diurno (quæ etiam viros graves ita obstupefecit ut <em>mallent credere
motum terræ</em>), facit motum illum ejaculationis ab ipsis [stellis]
(licet celeritate ut diximus admirabilem) magis credibilem.” This
passage shows an inclination towards the opinion of the earth’s being
at rest, but not a very strong conviction.</p>
<h4><i>Kepler persecuted.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">We</span> have seen (<a href="#v1page280">p.
280</a>) that Kepler writes to Galileo in 1597&#8212;“Be trustful and
go forwards. If Italy is not a convenient place for the publication of
your views, and if you are likely to meet with any obstacles, perhaps
Germany will grant us the necessary liberty.” Kepler however had soon
afterwards occasion to learn that in Germany also, the cultivators of
science were exposed to persecution. It is true that <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page533">533</a></span> in his case the
persecution went mainly on the broad ground of his being a Protestant,
and extended to great numbers of persons at that time. The
circumstances of this and other portions of Kepler’s life have been
brought to light only recently through an examination of public
documents in the Archives of Würtemberg and unpublished letters of
Kepler. (Johann Keppler’s Leben und Wirken, nach neuerlich
aufgefundenen Manuscripten bearbeitet von J. L. C. Freiherrn v.
Breitschwart, K. Würtemberg. Staats-Rath. Stuttgart, 1831.)</p>
<p>Schiller, in his <i>History of the Thirty Years’ War</i>, says that
when Ferdinand of Austria succeeded to the Archduchy of Stiria, and
found a great number of Protestants among his subjects, he suppressed
their public worship without cruelty and almost without noise. But it
appears now that the Protestants were treated with great severity.
Kepler held a professorship in Stiria, and had married, in 1507,
Barbara Müller, who had landed property in that province. On the 11th
of June, 1598, he writes to his friend Mæstlin that the arrival of the
Prince out of Italy is looked forwards to with terror. In December he
writes that the Protestants had irritated the Catholics by attacks
from the pulpit and by caricatures; that hereupon the Prince, at the
prayer of the Estates, had declared the Letter of License granted by
his father to be forfeited, and had ordered all the Evangelical
Teachers to leave the country on pain of death. They went to the
frontiers of Hungary and Croatia; but after a month, Kepler was
allowed to return, on condition of keeping quiet. His discoveries
appear to have operated in his favor. But the next year he found his
situation in Stiria intolerable, and longed to return to his native
country of Würtemberg, and to find some position there. This he did
not obtain. He wrote a circular letter to his Brother Protestants, to
give them consolation and courage; and this was held to be a violation
of the conditions on which his residence was tolerated. Fortunately,
at this time he was invited to join Tycho Brahe, who had also been
driven from his native country, and was living at Prague. The two
astronomers worked together under the patronage of the Emperor Rudolph
II.; and when Tycho died in 1601, Kepler became the Imperial
<i>Mathematicus</i>.</p>
<p>We are not to imagine that even among Protestants, astronomical
notions were out of the sphere of religious considerations. When
Kepler was established in Stiria, his first official business was the
calculation of the Calendar for the Evangelical Community. They
protested against the new Calendar, as manifestly calculated for the
furtherance of an impious papistry: and, say they, “We hold the Pope
for a <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page534">534</a></span> horrible
roaring Lion. If we take his Calendar, we must needs go into the
church when he rings us in.” Kepler however did not fail to see, and
to say, that the Papal Reformation of the Calendar was a vast
improvement.</p>
<p>Kepler, as court-astronomer, was of course required to provide such
observations of the heavens as were requisite for the calculations of
the Astrologers. That he considered Astrology to be valuable only as
the nurse of Astronomy, he did not hesitate to reveal. He wrote a work
with a title of which the following is the best translation which I
can give: “<i>Tertius interveniens</i>, or: A Warning to certain
<i>Theologi</i>, <i>Medici</i>, <i>Philosophi</i>, that while they
reasonably reject star-gazing superstition, they do not throw away the
kernel with the shell.<a id="fnanchor31-A" href="#note31-A"><span
class="fnanchor">31</span></a> 1610.” In this he says, “You
over-clever Philosophers blame this Daughter of Astronomy more than is
reasonable. Do you not know that she must maintain her mother with her
charms? How many men would be able to make Astronomy their business,
if men did not cherish the hope to read the Future in the skies?”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note31-A"
href="#fnanchor31-A">31</a></span> The German passage involves a
curious image, borrowed, I suppose, from some odd story: “dass sie mit
billiger Verwerfung des sternguckerischen Aberglaubens das Kind nicht
mit dem Bade ausschütten.” “That they do not throw away the child
along with the dirty water of his bath.”</div>
<h4><i>Were the Papal Edicts against the Copernican System
repealed?</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">Admiral Smyth</span>, in his <i>Cycle of Celestial
Objects</i>, vol. i. p. 65, says&#8212;“At length, in 1818, the voice
of truth was so prevailing that Pius VII. repealed the edicts against
the Copernican system, and thus, in the emphatic words of Cardinal
Toriozzi, ‘wiped off this scandal from the Church.’”</p>
<p>A like story is referred to by Sir Francis Palgrave, in his
entertaining and instructive fiction, <i>The Merchant and the
Friar</i>.</p>
<p>Having made inquiry of persons most likely to be well informed on
this subject, I have not been able to learn that there is any further
foundation for these statements than this: In 1818, on the revisal of
the <i>Index Expurgatorius</i>, Galileo’s writings were, after some
opposition, expunged from that Catalogue.</p>
<p>Monsignor Marino Marini, an eminent Roman Prelate, had addressed to
the <i>Romana Accademia di Archeologia</i>, certain historico-critical
Memoirs, which he published in 1850, with the title <i>Galileo e
l’Inquisizione</i>. In these, he confirms the conclusion which, I
think, almost <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page535">535</a></span>
all persons who have studied the facts have arrived at;<a
id="fnanchor32-A" href="#note32-A"><span
class="fnanchor">32</span></a> that Galileo trifled with authority to
which he professed to submit, and was punished for obstinate
contumacy, not for heresy. M. Marini renders full justice to Galileo’s
ability, and does not at all hesitate to regard his scientific
attainments as among the glories of Italy. He quotes, what Galileo
himself quoted, an expression of Cardinal Baronius, that “the
intention of the Holy Spirit was to teach how to go to heaven, not how
heaven goes.”<a id="fnanchor33-A" href="#note33-A"><span
class="fnanchor">33</span></a> He shows that Galileo pleaded (p. 62)
that he had not held the Copernican opinion after it had been
intimated to him (by Bellarmine in 1616), that he was not to hold it;
and that his breach of promise in this respect was the cause of the
proceedings against him.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note32-A"
href="#fnanchor32-A">32</a></span> M. Marini (p. 29) mentions
Leibnitz, Guizot, Spittler, Eichhorn, Raumer, Ranke, among the
“storici eterodossi” who have at last done justice to the Roman
Church.</div>

<p class="space-above">Those who admire Galileo and regard him as a
martyr because, after escaping punishment by saying “It <em>does
not</em> move,” he forthwith said “And yet it <em>does</em> move,”
will perhaps be interested to know that the former answer was
suggested to him by friends anxious for his safety. Niccolini writes
to Bali Cioli (April 9, 1633) that Galileo continued to be so
persuaded of the truth of his opinions that “he was resolved (some
moments before his sentence) to defend them stoutly; but I (continues
Niccolini) exhorted him to make an end of this; not to mind defending
them; and to submit himself to that which he sees that they may desire
him to believe or to hold about this matter of the motion of the
earth. He was extremely afflicted.” But the Inquisition was satisfied
with his answers, and required no more.<a id="fnanchor34-A"

href="#v1page372">page 372</a>, I have stated that Lagrange, near the
end of his life, expressed his sorrow that the methods of
approximation employed in Physical Astronomy rested on arbitrary
processes, and not on any insight into the results of mechanical
action. From the recent biography of Gauss, the greatest physical
mathematician of modern times, we learn that he congratulated himself
on having escaped this error. He remarked<a id="fnanchor35-A"
href="#note35-A"><span class="fnanchor">35</span></a> that many of the
most celebrated mathematicians, Euler very often, Lagrange sometimes,
had trusted too much to the symbolical calculation of their problems,
and would not have been able to give an account of the meaning of each
successive step of their investigation. He said that he himself, on
the other hand, could assert that at every step which he took, he
always had the aim and purpose of his operations before his eyes
without ever turning aside from the way. The same, he remarked, might
be said of Newton.</p>

<h4><i>Engineering Mechanics.</i></h4>
<p>The principles of the science of Mechanics were discovered by
observations made upon bodies within the reach of men; as we have seen
in speaking of the discoveries of Stevinus, Galileo, and others, up to
the time of Newton. And when there arose the controversy about <i>vis
viva</i> (Chap. v. <a href="#v1page356">Sect. 2</a> of this
Book);&#8212;namely, whether the “living force” of a body is measured
by the product of the weight into the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page537">537</a></span> velocity, or of the weight into the
square of the velocity;&#8212;still the examples taken were cases of
action in machines and the like terrestrial objects. But Newton’s
discoveries identified celestial with terrestrial mechanics; and from
that time the mechanical problems of the heavens became more important
and attractive to mathematicians than the problems about earthly
machines. And thus the generalizations of the problems, principles,
and methods of the mathematical science of Mechanics from this period
are principally those which have reference to the motions of the
heavenly bodies: such as the Problem of Three Bodies, the Principles
of the Conservation of Areas, and of the Immovable Plane, the Method
of Variation of Parameters, and the like (Chap. vi. <a
href="#v1page367">Sect. 7</a> and <a href="#v1page380">14</a>). And
the same is the case in the more recent progress of that subject, in
the hands of Gauss, Bessel, Hansen, and others.</p>
<p>But yet the science of Mechanics as applied to terrestrial
machines&#8212;<i>Industrial Mechanics</i>, as it has been
termed&#8212;has made some steps which it may be worth while to
notice, even in a general history of science. For the most part, all
the most general laws of mechanical action being already finally
established, in the way which we have had to narrate, the
determination of the results and conditions of any combination of
materials and movements becomes really a mathematical deduction from
known principles. But such deductions may be made much more easy and
much more luminous by the establishment of general terms and general
propositions suited to their special conditions. Among these I may
mention a new abstract term, introduced because a general mechanical
principle can be expressed by means of it, which has lately been much
employed by the mathematical engineers of France, MM. Poncelet,
Navier, Morin, &amp;c. The abstract term is <i>Travail</i>, which has
been translated <i>Laboring Force</i>; and the principle which gives
it its value, and makes it useful in the solution of problems, is
this;&#8212;that the <i>work done</i> (in overcoming resistance or
producing any other effect) is equal to the <i>Laboring Force</i>, by
whatever contrivances the force be applied. This is not a new
principle, being in fact mathematically equivalent to the conservation
of Vis Viva; but it has been employed by the mathematicians of whom I
have spoken with a fertility and simplicity which make it the mark of
a new school of <i>The Mechanics of Engineering</i>.</p>
<p>The Laboring Force expended and the work done have been described
by various terms, as <i>Theoretical Effect</i> and <i>Practical
Effect</i>, and the like. The usual term among English engineers for
the work <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page538">538</a></span> which
an Engine usually does, is <i>Duty</i>; but as this word naturally
signifies what the engine <em>ought</em> to do, rather than what it
does, we should at least distinguish between the Theoretical and the
Actual Duty.</p>
<p>The difference between the Theoretical and Actual Duty of a Machine
arises from this: that a portion of the Laboring Force is absorbed in
producing effects, that is, in doing work which is not reckoned as
Duty: for instance, overcoming the resistance and waste of the machine
itself. And so long as this resistance and waste are not rightly
estimated, no correspondence can be established between the
theoretical and the practical Duty. Though much had been written
previously upon the theory of the steam-engine, the correspondence
between the Force expended and the Work done was not clearly made out
till Comte De Pambour published his <i>Treatise on Locomotive
Engines</i> in 1835, and his <i>Theory of the Steam-Engine</i> in
1839.</p>
<h4><i>Strength of Materials.</i></h4>
<p>Among the subjects which have specially engaged the attention of
those who have applied the science of Mechanics to practical matters,
is the strength of materials: for example, the strength of a
horizontal beam to resist being broken by a weight pressing upon it.
This was one of the problems which Galileo took up. He was led to his
study of it by a visit which he made to the arsenal and dockyards of
Venice, and the conclusions which he drew were published in his
<i>Dialogues</i>, in 1633. In his mode of regarding the problem, he
considers the section at which the beam breaks as the short arm of a
bent lever which resists fracture, and the part of the beam which is
broken off as the longer arm of the lever, the lever turning about the
fracture as a hinge. So far this is true; and from this principle he
obtained results which are also true  as, that the strength of a
rectangular beam is proportional to the breadth multiplied into the
square of the depth:&#8212;that a hollow beam is stronger than a solid
beam of the same mass; and the like.</p>
<p>But he erred in this, that he supposed the hinge about which the
breaking beam turns, to be exactly at the unrent surface, that surface
resisting all change, and the beam being rent all the way across.
Whereas the fact is, that the unrent surface yields to compression,
while the opposite surface is rent; and the hinge about which the
breaking beam turns is at an intermediate point, where the extension
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page539">539</a></span> and rupture
end, and the compression and crushing begin: a point which has been
called <i>the neutral axis</i>. This was pointed out by Mariotte; and
the notion, once suggested, was so manifestly true that it was adopted
by mathematicians in general. James Bernoulli,<a id="fnanchor36-A"
href="#note36-A"><span class="fnanchor">36</span></a> in 1705,
investigated the strength of beams on this view; and several eminent
mathematicians pursued the subject; as Varignon, Parent, and
Bulfinger; and at a later period, Dr. Robison in our own country.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note36-A"
href="#fnanchor36-A">36</a></span> <i>Opera</i>, ii. p. 976.</div>
<p>But along with the fracture of beams, the mathematicians considered
also another subject, the flexure of beams, which they undergo before
they break, in virtue of their elasticity. What is the <i>elastic
curve</i>?&#8212;the curve into which an elastic line forms itself
under the pressure of a weight&#8212;is a problem which had been
proposed by Galileo, and was fully solved, as a mathematical problem,
by Euler and others.</p>
<p>But beams in practice are not mere lines: they are solids. And
their resistance to flexure, and the amount of it, depends upon the
resistance of their internal parts to extension and compression, and
is different for different substances. To measure these differences,
Dr. Thomas Young introduced the notion of the <i>Modulus of
Elasticity</i>:<a id="fnanchor37-A" href="#note37-A"><span
class="fnanchor">37</span></a> meaning thereby a column of the
substance of the same diameter, such as would by its weight produce a
compression equal to the whole length of the beam, the rate of
compression being supposed to continue the same throughout. Thus if a
rod of any kind, 100 inches long, were compressed 1 inch by a weight
1000 pounds, the weight of its modulus of elasticity would be 100,000
pounds. This notion assumes Hooke’s law that the extension of a
substance is as its tension; and extends this law to compression
also.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note37-A"
href="#fnanchor37-A">37</a></span> Lecture xiii. The height of the
modulus is the same for the same substance, whatever its breadth and
thickness may be; for atmospheric air it is about five miles, and for
steel nearly 1500 miles.</div>
<p>There is this great advantage in introducing the definition of the
Modulus of Elasticity,&#8212;that it applies equally to the flexure of
a substance and to the minute vibrations which propagate sound, and
the like. And the notion was applied so as to lead to curious and
important results with regard to the power of beams to resist flexure,
not only when loaded transversely, but when pressed in the direction
of their length, and in any oblique direction.</p>
<p>But in the fracture of beams, the resistance to extension and to
compression are not practically equal; and it was necessary to
determine <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page540">540</a></span> the
difference of these two forces by experiments. Several persons pursued
researches on this subject; especially Mr. Barlow, of the Royal
Military Academy,<a id="fnanchor38-A" href="#note38-A"><span
class="fnanchor">38</span></a> who investigated the subject with great
labor and skill, so far as wood is concerned. But the difference
between the resistance to tension and to compression requires more
special study in the case of iron; and has been especially attended to
in recent times, in consequence of the vast increase in the number of
iron structures, and in particular, railways. It appears that wrought
iron yields to compressive somewhat more easily than to tensile force,
while cast iron yields far more easily to tensile than to compressive
strains. In all cases the power of a beam to resist fracture resides
mainly in the upper and the under side, for there the tenacity of the
material acts at the greatest leverage round the hinge of fracture.
Hence the practice was introduced of making iron beams with a broad
<i>flange</i> at the upper and another flange at the under side,
connected by a vertical plate or <i>web</i>, of which the office was
to keep the two flanges asunder. Mr. Hodgkinson made many valuable
experiments, on a large scale, to determine the forms and properties
of such beams.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note38-A"
href="#fnanchor38-A">38</a></span> <i>An Essay on the Strength and
Shape of Timber</i>. 3d edition, 1826.</div>
<p>But though engineers were, by such experiments and reasonings,
enabled to calculate the strength of a given iron beam, and the
dimensions of a beam which should bear a given load, it would hardly
have occurred to the boldest speculator, a few years ago, to predict
that there might be constructed beams nearly 500 feet long, resting
merely on their two extremities, of which it could be known
beforehand, that they would sustain, without bending or yielding in
any perceptible degree, the weight of a railroad train, and the jar of
its unchecked motion. Yet of such beams, constructed beforehand with
the most perfect confidence, crowned with the most complete success,
is composed the great tubular bridge which that consummate engineer,
Mr. Robert Stephenson, has thrown across the Menai Strait, joining
Wales with the island of Anglesey. The upper and under surfaces of
this quadrangular tube are the flanges of the beam, and the two sides
are the webs which connect them. In planning this wonderful structure,
the point which required especial care was to make the upper surface
strong enough to resist the compressive force which it has to sustain;
and this was done by constructing the upper part of the beam of a
series of cells, made of iron plate. The application of the arch, of
the dome, and of groined vaulting, to the widest space over which they
have ever been thrown, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page541">541</a></span> are achievements which have, in the ages
in which they occurred, been received with great admiration and
applause; but in those cases the principle of the structure had been
tried and verified for ages upon a smaller scale. Here not only was
the space thus spanned wider than any ever spanned before, but the
principle of such a beam with a cellular structure of its parts, was
invented for this very purpose, experimentally verified with care, and
applied with the most exact calculation of its results.</p>
<h4><i>Roofs&#8212;Arches&#8212;Vaults.</i></h4>
<p>The calculations of the mechanical conditions of structures
consisting of several beams, as for instance, the frames of roofs,
depends upon elementary principles of mechanics; and was a subject of
investigation at an early period of the science. Such frames may be
regarded as assemblages of levers. The parts of which they consist are
rigid beams which sustain and convey force, and <i>Ties</i> which
resist such force by their tension. The former parts must be made
rigid in the way just spoken of with regard to iron beams; but ties
may be rods merely. The wide structures of many of the roofs of
railway stations, compared with the massive wooden roofs of ancient
buildings, may show us how boldly and how successfully this
distinction has been carried out in modern times. The investigation of
the conditions and strength of structures consisting of wooden beams
has been cultivated by Mathematicians and Engineers, and is often
entitled <i>Carpentry</i> in our Mechanical Treatises. In our own
time, Dr. Robison and Dr. Thomas Young have been two of the most
eminent mathematicians who have written upon this subject.</p>
<p>The properties of the simple machines have been known, as we have
narrated, from the time of the Ancient Greeks. But it is plain that
such machines are prevented from producing their full effect by
various causes. Among the rest, the rubbing of one part of the machine
upon another produces an obstacle to the effectiveness of a machine:
for instance, the rubbing of the axle of a wheel in the hole in which
it rests, the rubbing of a screw against the sides of its hollow
screw; the rubbing of a wedge against the sides of its notch; the
rubbing of a cord against its pulley. In all these cases, the effect
of the machine to produce motion is diminished by the friction. And
this <i>Friction</i> may be measured and its effects calculated; and
thus we have a new branch of mechanics, which has been much
cultivated. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page542">542</a></span></p>
<p>Among the effects of friction, we may notice the standing of a
stone arch. For each of the vaulting stones of an arch is a truncated
wedge; and though a collection of such stones might be so proportioned
in their weights as to balance exactly, yet this balance would be a
tottering equilibrium, which the slightest shock would throw down, and
which would not practically subsist. But the friction of the vaulting
stones against one another prevents this instability from being a
practical inconvenience; and makes an equilibrated arch to be an arch
strong for practical purposes. The <i>Theory of Arches</i> is a
portion of Mechanics which has been much cultivated, and which has led
to conclusions of practical use, as well as of theoretical beauty.</p>
<p>I have already spoken of the invention of the Arch, the Dome, and
Groined Vaulting, as marked steps in building. In all these cases the
invention was devised by practical builders; and mechanical theory,
though it can afterwards justify these structures, did not originally
suggest them. They are not part of the result, nor even of the
application of theory, but only of its exemplification. The authors of
all these inventions are unknown; and the inventions themselves may be
regarded as a part of the Prelude of the science of mechanics, because
they indicate that the ideas of mechanical pressure and support, in
various forms, are acquiring clearness and fixity.</p>
<p>In this point of view, I spoke (Book iv. chap. v. <a
href="#v1page246">sect. 5</a>) of the Architecture of the Middle Ages
as indicating a progress of thought which led men towards the
formation of Statics as a science.</p>
<p>As particular instances of the operation of such ideas, we have the
<i>Flying Buttresses</i> which support stone vaults; and especially,
as already noted, the various contrivances by which stone vaults are
made to intersect one another, so as to cover a complex pillared space
below with <i>Groined Vaulting</i>. This invention, executed as it was
by the builders of the twelfth and succeeding centuries, is the most
remarkable advance in the mechanics of building, after the invention
of the <i>Arch</i> itself.</p>
<p>It is curious that it has been the fortune of our times, among its
many inventions, to have produced one in this department, of which we
may say that it is the most remarkable step in the mechanics of arches
which has been made since the introduction of pointed groined vaults.
I speak of what are called <i>Skew Arches</i>, in which the courses of
stone or brick of which the bridge is built run obliquely to the walls
of the bridge. Such bridges have become very common in the works of
railroads; for they save space and material, and the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page543">543</a></span> invention once made,
the cost of the ingenuity is nothing. Of course, the mechanical
principles involved in such structures are obvious to the
mathematician, when the problem has been practically solved. And in
this case, as in the previous cardinal inventions in structure, though
the event has taken place within a few years, no single person, so far
as I am aware, can be named as the inventor.<a id="fnanchor39-A"
href="#note39-A"><span class="fnanchor">39</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note39-A"
href="#fnanchor39-A">39</a></span> Since this was written, I have been
referred to Rees’s <i>Cyclopædia</i>, Article <i>Oblique Arches</i>,
where this invention is correctly explained, and is claimed for an
engineer named Chapman. It is there said, that the first arch of this
kind was erected in 1787 at Naas, near Kildare in Ireland.</div>

<h4 class="five"><i>The Ancients.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">EXPRESSIONS</span> in ancient writers
which may be interpreted as indicating a notion of gravitation in the
Newtonian sense, no doubt occur. But such a notion, we may be sure,
must have been in the highest degree obscure, wavering, and partial. I
have mentioned (Book i. <a href="#v1page82">Chap. 3</a>) an author who
has fancied that he traces in the works of the ancients the origin of
most of the vaunted discoveries of the moderns. But to ascribe much
importance to such expressions would be to give a false representation
of the real progress of science. Yet some of Newton’s followers put
forward these passages as well deserving notice; and Newton himself
appears to have had some pleasure in citing such expressions; probably
with the feeling that they relieved him of some of the odium which, he
seems to have apprehended, hung over new discoveries. The Preface to
the <i>Principia</i>, begins by quoting<a id="fnanchor40-A"
href="#note40-A"><span class="fnanchor">40</span></a> the authority of
the ancients, as well as the moderns, in favor of applying the science
of Mechanics to Natural Philosophy. In the Preface to David Gregory’s
<i>Astronomiæ Physicæ et Geometricæ Elementa</i>, published in 1702,
is a large array of names of ancient authors, and of quotations, to
prove the early and wide diffusion of the doctrine of the gravity of
the Heavenly Bodies. And it appears to be now made out, that this
collection of ancient authorities <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page545">545</a></span> was supplied to Gregory by Newton
himself. The late Professor Rigaud, in his <i>Historical Essay on the
First Publication of Sir Isaac Newton’s Principia</i>, says (pp. 80
and 101) that having been allowed to examine Gregory’s papers, he
found that the quotations given by him in his Preface are copied or
abridged from notes which Newton had supplied to him in his own
handwriting. Some of the most noticeable of the quotations are those
taken from Plutarch’s Dialogue <i>on the Face which appears in the
Moon’s Disk</i>: it is there said, for example, by one of the
speakers, that the Moon is perhaps prevented from falling to the earth
by the rapidity of her revolution round it; as a stone whirled in a
sling keeps it stretched. Lucretius also is quoted, as teaching that
all bodies would descend with an equal celerity in a vacuum:</p>

<p>It is asserted in Gregory’s Preface that Pythagoras was not
unacquainted with the important law of gravity, the inverse squares of
the distances from the centre. For, it is argued, the seven strings of
Apollo’s lyre mean the seven planets; and the proportions of the notes
of strings are reciprocally as the inverse squares of the weights
which stretch them.</p>
<p>I have attempted, throughout this work, to trace the progress of
the discovery of the great truths which constitute real science, in a
more precise manner than that which these interpretations of ancient
authors exemplify.</p>
<h4 id="horrox"><i>Jeremiah Horrox.</i></h4>
<p>In describing the Prelude to the Epoch of Newton, I have spoken (<a
href="#v1page395">p. 395</a>) of a group of philosophers in England
who began, in the first half of the seventeenth century, to knock at
the door where Truth was to be found, although it was left for Newton
to force it open; and I have there noticed the influence of the civil
wars on the progress of philosophical studies. To the persons thus
tending towards the true physical theory of the solar system, I ought
to have added Jeremy Horrox, whom I have mentioned in a former part
(Book v. <a href="#v1page304">chap. 5</a>) as one of the earliest
admirers of Kepler’s discoveries. He died at the early age of
twenty-two, having been the first person who ever saw Venus pass
across the disk of the Sun according to astronomical prediction, which
took place in 1639. His <i>Venus in sole visa</i>, <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page546">546</a></span> in which this is
described, did not appear till 1661, when it was published by Hevelius
of Dantzic. Some of his papers were destroyed by the soldiers in the
English civil wars; and his remaining works were finally published by
Wallis, in 1673. The passage to which I here specially wish to refer
is contained in a letter to his astronomical ally, William Crabtree,
dated 1638. He appears to have been asked by his friend to suggest
some cause for the motion of the aphelion of a planet; and in reply,
he uses an experimental illustration which was afterwards employed by
Hooke in 1666. A ball at the end of a string is made to swing so that
it describes an oval. This contrivance Hooke employed to show the way
in which an orbit results from the combination of a projectile motion
with a central force. But the oval does not keep its axis constantly
in the same position. The apsides, as Horrox remarked, move in the
same direction as the pendulum, though much slower. And it is true,
that this experiment does illustrate, in a general way, the cause of
the motion of the aphelia of the Planetary Orbits; although the form
of the orbit is different in the experiment and in the solar system;
being an ellipse with the centre of force in the centre of the
ellipse, in the former case, and an ellipse with the centre of force
in the focus, in the latter case. These two forms of orbits correspond
to a central force varying directly as the distance, and a central
force varying inversely as the square of the distance; as Newton
proved in the <i>Principia</i>. But the illustration appears to show
that Horrox pretty clearly saw how an orbit arose from a central
force. So far, and no further, Newton’s contemporaries could get; and
then he had to help them onwards by showing what was the law of the
force, and what larger truths were now attainable.</p>
<h4 id="apple"><i>Newton’s Discovery of Gravitation.</i></h4>
<p>[<a href="#v1page402">Page 402</a>.] As I have already remarked,
men have a willingness to believe that great discoveries are governed
by casual coincidences, and accompanied by sudden revolutions of
feeling. Newton had entertained the thought of the moon being retained
in her orbit by gravitation as early as 1665 or 1666. He resumed the
subject and worked the thought out into a system in 1684 and 5. What
induced him to return to the question? What led to his success on this
last occasion? With what feelings was the success attended? It is easy
to make an imaginary connection of facts. “His optical discoveries had
recommended him to the Royal Society, and he was now a member. He
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page547">547</a></span> <em>there</em>
learned the accurate measurement of the Earth by Picard, differing
very much from the estimation by which he had made his calculation in
1666; and he thought his conjecture now more likely to be just.”<a
id="fnanchor41-A" href="#note41-A"><span
class="fnanchor">41</span></a> M. Biot gives his assent to this
guess.<a id="fnanchor42-A" href="#note42-A"><span
class="fnanchor">42</span></a> The English translation of M. Biot’s
biography<a id="fnanchor43-A" href="#note43-A"><span
class="fnanchor">43</span></a> converts the guess into an assertion.
But, says Professor Rigaud,<a id="fnanchor44-A" href="#note44-A"><span
class="fnanchor">44</span></a> Picard’s measurement of the Earth was
well known to the Fellows of the Royal Society as early as 1675, there
being an account of the results of it given in the <i>Philosophical
Transactions</i> for that year. Moreover, Norwood, in his <i>Seaman’s
Practice</i>, dated 1636, had given a much more exact measure than
Newton employed in 1666. But Norwood, says Voltaire, had been buried
in oblivion by the civil wars. No, again says the exact and
truth-loving Professor Rigaud, Norwood was in communication with the
Royal Society in 1667 and 1668. So these guesses at the accident which
made the apple of 1665 germinate in 1684, are to be carefully
distinguished from history.</p>

<p>But with what feelings did Newton attain to his success? Here again
we have, I fear, nothing better than conjecture. “He went home, took
out his old papers, and resumed his calculations. As they drew near to
a close, he was so much agitated that he was obliged to desire a
friend to finish them. His former conjecture was now found to agree
with the phænomena with the utmost precision.”<a id="fnanchor45-A"
href="#note45-A"><span class="fnanchor">45</span></a> This conjectural
story has been called “a tradition;” but he who relates it does not
call it so. Every one must decide, says Professor Rigaud, from his
view of Newton’s character, how far he thinks it consistent with this
statement. Is it likely that Newton, so calm and so indifferent to
fame as he generally showed himself, should be thus agitated on such
an occasion? “No,” says Sir David Brewster; “it is not supported by
what we know of Newton’s character.”<a id="fnanchor46-A"
href="#note46-A"><span class="fnanchor">46</span></a> To this we may
assent; and this conjectural incident we must therefore, I conceive,
separate from history. I had incautiously admitted it into the text of
the first Edition.</p>

<p>Newton appears to have discovered the method of demonstrating that
a body might describe an ellipse when acted upon by a force residing
in the focus, and varying inversely as the square of the distance, in
1669, upon occasion of his correspondence with Hooke. In 1684, <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page548">548</a></span> at Halley’s request,
he returned to the subject; and in February, 1685 there was inserted
in the Register of the Royal Society a paper of Newton’s (<i>Isaaci
Newtoni Propositiones de Motu</i>), which contained some of the
principal propositions of the first two Books of the <i>Principia</i>.
This paper, however, does not contain the proposition “Lunam gravitare
in Terram,” nor any of the propositions of the Third Book.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Reception of the Principia.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">LORD BROUGHAM</span> has very
recently (<i>Analytical View of Sir Isaac Newton’s Principia</i>,
1855) shown a strong disposition still to maintain, what he says has
frequently been alleged, that the reception of the work was not, even
in this country, “such as might have been expected.” He says, in
explanation of the facts which I have adduced, showing the high
estimation in which Newton was held immediately after the publication
of the <i>Principia</i>, that Newton’s previous fame was great by
former discoveries. This is true; but the effect of this was precisely
what was most honorable to Newton’s countrymen, that they received
with immediate acclamations this new and greater discovery. Lord
Brougham adds, “after its appearance the <i>Principia</i> was more
admired than studied;” which is probably true of the <i>Principia</i>
still, and of all great works of like novelty and difficulty at all
times. But, says Lord Brougham, “there is no getting over the
inference on this head which arises from the dates of the two first
editions. There elapsed an interval of no less than twenty-seven years
between them; and although Cotes [in his Preface] speaks of the copies
having become scarce and in very great demand when the second edition
appeared in 1713, yet had this urgent demand been of many years’
continuance, the reprinting could never have been so long delayed.”
But Lord Brougham might have learnt from Sir David Brewster’s <i>Life
of Newton</i> (vol. i. p. 312), which he extols so emphatically, that
already in 1691 (only four years after the publication), a copy of the
<i>Principia</i> could hardly be procured, and that even at that <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page549">549</a></span> time an improved
edition was in contemplation; that Newton had been pressed by his
friends to undertake it, and had refused.</p>
<p>When Bentley had induced Newton to consent that a new edition
should be printed, he announces his success with obvious exultation to
Cotes, who was to superintend the work. And in the mean time the
<i>Astronomy</i> of David Gregory, published in 1702, showed in every
page how familiar the Newtonian doctrines were to English
philosophers, and tended to make them more so, as the sermons of
Bentley himself had done in 1692.</p>
<p>Newton’s Cambridge contemporaries were among those who took a part
in bringing the <i>Principia</i> before the world. The manuscript
draft of it was conveyed to the Royal Society (April 28, 1686) by Dr.
Vincent, Fellow of Clare Hall, who was the tutor of Whiston, Newton’s
deputy in his professorship; and he, in presenting the work, spoke of
the novelty and dignity of the subject. There exists in the library of
the University of Cambridge a manuscript containing the early
Propositions of the <i>Principia</i> as far as Prop. xxxiii. (which is
a part of Section vii., about Falling Bodies). This appears to have
been a transcript of Newton’s Lectures, delivered as Lucasian
Professor: it is dated October, 1684.</p>
<h4><i>Is Gravitation proportional to Quantity of Matter?</i></h4>
<p>It was a portion of Newton’s assertion in his great discovery, that
all the bodies of the universe attract each other with forces which
are <em>as the quantity of matter</em> in each: that is, for instance,
the sun attracts the satellites of any planet just as much as he
attracts the planet itself, in proportion to the quantity of matter in
each; and the planets attract one another just as much as they attract
the sun, according to the quantity of matter.</p>
<p>To prove this part of the law <em>exactly</em> is a matter which
requires careful experiments; and though proved experimentally by
Newton, has been considered in our time worthy of re-examination by
the great astronomer Bessel. There was some ground for doubt; for the
mass of Jupiter, as deduced from the perturbations of Saturn, was only
<span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>1070</sub></span> of the mass of the sun;
the mass of the same planet as deduced from the perturbations of Juno
and Pallas was  <span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>1045</sub></span> of that of the Sun. If
this difference were to be confirmed by accurate observations and
calculations, it would follow that the attractive power exercised by
Jupiter upon the minor planets was greater than that exercised upon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page550">550</a></span> Saturn. And in
the same way, if the attraction of the Earth had any <em>specific</em>
relation to different kinds of matter, the time of oscillation of a
pendulum of equal length composed wholly or in part of the two
substances would be different. If, for instance, it were more intense
for magnetized iron than for stone, the iron pendulum would oscillate
more quickly. Bessel showed<a id="fnanchor47-A" href="#note47-A"><span
class="fnanchor">47</span></a> that it was possible to assume
hypothetically a constitution of the sun, planets, and their
appendages, such that the attraction of the Sun on the Planets and
Satellites should be proportional to the quantity of matter in each;
but that the attraction of the Planets on one another would not be on
the same scale.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note47-A"
href="#fnanchor47-A">47</a></span> <i>Berlin Mem.</i> 1824.</div>
<p>Newton had made experiments (described in the <i>Principia</i>,
Book iii., Prop. vi.) by which it was shown that there could be no
considerable or palpable amount of such specific difference among
terrestrial bodies, but his experiments could not be regarded as exact
enough for the requirements of modern science. Bessel instituted a
laborious series of experiments (presented to the Berlin Academy in
1832) which completely disproved the conjecture of such a difference;
every substance examined having given exactly the same coefficient of
gravitating intensity as compared with inertia. Among the substances
examined were metallic and stony masses of meteoric origin, which
might be supposed, if any bodies could, to come from other parts of
the solar system.</p>

<h4 class="five" id="tables"><i>Tables of the Moon and
Planets.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> Newtonian discovery of
Universal Gravitation, so remarkable in other respects, is also
remarkable as exemplifying the immense extent to which the
verification of a great truth may be carried, the amount of human
labor which may be requisite to do it justice, and the striking
extension of human knowledge to which it may lead. I have said that it
is remarked as a beauty in the first fixation of a theory that its
measures or elements are established by means of a few <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page551">551</a></span> data; but that its
excellence when established is in the number of observations which it
explains. The multiplicity of observations which are explained by
astronomy, and which are made because astronomy explains them, is
immense, as I have noted in the text. And the multitude of
observations thus made is employed for the purpose of correcting the
first adopted elements of the theory. I have mentioned some of the
examples of this process: I might mention many others in order to
continue the history of this part of Astronomy up to the present time.
But I will notice only those which seem to me the most remarkable.</p>
<p>In 1812, Burckhardt’s <i>Tables de la Lune</i> were published by
the French Bureau des Longitudes. A comparison of these and Burg’s
with a considerable number of observations, gave <span
style="font-size: 80%"><sup>9</sup>⁄<sub>100</sub></span>ths of
a second as the mean error of the former in the Moon’s longitude,
while the mean error of Burg’s was <span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>18</sup>⁄<sub>100</sub></span>ths. The preference was
therefore accorded to Burckhardt’s.</p>
<p>Yet the Lunar Tables were still as much as thirty seconds wrong in
single observations. This circumstance, and Laplace’s expressed wish,
induced the French Academy to offer a prize for a complete and purely
theoretical determination of the Lunar path, instead of determinations
resting, as hitherto, partly upon theory and partly upon observations.
In 1820, two prize essays appeared, the one by Damoiseau, the other by
Plana and Carlini. And some years afterwards (in 1824, and again in
1828), Damoiseau published <i>Tables de la Lune formées sur la seule
Théorie d’Attraction</i>. These agree very closely with observation.
That we may form some notion of the complexity of the problem, I may
state that the longitude of the Moon is in these Tables affected by no
fewer than forty-seven <em>equations</em>; and the other quantities
which determine her place are subject to inequalities not much less in
number.</p>
<p>Still I had to state in the second Edition, published in 1847, that
there remained an unexplained discordance between theory and
observation in the motions of the Moon; an inequality of long period
as it seemed, which the theory did not give.</p>
<p>A careful examination of a long series of the best observations of
the Moon, compared throughout with the theory in its most perfect
form, would afford the means both of correcting the numerical elements
of the theory, and of detecting the nature, and perhaps the law, of
any still remaining discrepancies. Such a work, however, required vast
labor, as well as great skill and profound mathematical knowledge.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page552">552</a></span> Mr. Airy
undertook the task; employing for that purpose, the Observations of
the Moon made at Greenwich from 1750 to 1830. Above 8000 observed
places of the Moon were compared with theory by the computation of the
same number of places, each separately and independently calculated
from Plana’s Formulæ. A body of calculators (sometimes sixteen), at
the expense of the British Government, was employed for about eight
years in this work. When we take this in conjunction with the labor
which the observations themselves imply, it may serve to show on what
a scale the verification of the Newtonian theory has been conducted.
The first results of this labor were published in two quarto volumes;
the final deductions as to correction of elements, &amp;c., were given
in the Memoirs of the Astronomical Society in 1848.<a
id="fnanchor48-A" href="#note48-A"><span
class="fnanchor">48</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note48-A"
href="#fnanchor48-A">48</a></span> The total expense of computers, to
the end of reading the proof-sheets, was 4300<i>l.</i><br />
&#8195;Mr. Airy’s estimate of days’ works [made before beginning], for
the heavy part of calculations only, was thirty-six years of one
computer. This was somewhat exceeded, but not very greatly, in that
part.</div>
<p>Even while the calculations were going on, it became apparent that
there were some differences between the observed places of the Moon,
and the theory so far as it had then been developed. M. Hansen, an
eminent German mathematician who had devised new and powerful methods
for the mathematical determination of the results of the law of
gravitation, was thus led to explore still further the motions of the
Moon in pursuance of this law. The result was that he found there must
exist two lunar inequalities, hitherto not known; the one of 273, and
the other of 239 years, the coefficients of which are respectively 27
and 23 seconds. Both these originate in the attraction of Venus; one
of them being connected with the long inequality in the Solar Tables,
of which Mr. Airy had already proved the existence, as stated in Chap.
vi. <a href="#v1page483">Sect. 6</a> of this Book.</p>
<p>These inequalities fell in with the discrepancies between the
actual observations and the previously calculated Tables, which Mr.
Airy had discovered. And again, shortly afterwards, M. Hansen found
that there resulted from the theory two other new equations of the
Moon; one in latitude and one in longitude, agreeing with two which
were found by Mr. Airy in deducing from the observations the
correction of the elements of the Lunar Tables. And again, a little
later, there was detected by these mathematicians a theoretical
correction for the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page553">553</a></span> motion of the Node of the Moon’s orbit,
coinciding exactly with one which had been found to appear in the
observations.</p>
<p>Nothing can more strikingly exhibit the confirmation which
increased scrutiny brings to light between the Newtonian theory on the
one hand, and the celestial motions on the other. We have here a very
large mass of the best observations which have ever been made,
systematically examined, with immense labor, and with the set purpose
of correcting at once all the elements of the Lunar Tables. The
corrections of the elements thus deduced imply of course some error in
the theory as previously developed. But at the same time, and with the
like determination thoroughly to explore the subject, the theory is
again pressed to yield its most complete results, by the invention of
new and powerful mathematical methods; and the event is, that residual
errors of the old Tables, several in number, following the most
diverse laws, occurring in several detached parts, agree with the
residual results of the Theory thus newly extracted from it. And thus
every additional exactness of scrutiny into the celestial motions on
the one hand and the Newtonian theory on the other, has ended, sooner
or later, in showing the exactness of their coincidence.</p>
<p>The comparison of the theory with observation in the case of the
motions of the Planets, the motion of each being disturbed by the
attraction of all the others, is a subject in some respects still more
complicated and laborious. This work also was undertaken by the same
indefatigable astronomer; and here also his materials belonged to the
same period as before; being the admirable observations made at
Greenwich from 1750 to 1830, during the time that Bradley, Maskelyne,
and Pond were the Astronomers Royal.<a id="fnanchor49-A"
href="#note49-A"><span class="fnanchor">49</span></a> These Planetary
observations were deduced, and the observed places were compared with
the tabular places: with Lindenau’s Tables of Mercury, Venus, and
Mars; and with Bouvard’s Tables of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus; and
thus, while the received theory and its elements were confirmed, the
means of testing any improvement which may hereafter be proposed,
either in the form of the theoretical results or in the constant
elements which they involved, was placed within the reach of the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page554">554</a></span> astronomers of all
future time. The work appeared in 1845; the expense of the
compilations and the publication being defrayed by the British
Government.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note49-A"
href="#fnanchor49-A">49</a></span> The observations of stars made by
Bradley, who preceded Maskelyne at Greenwich, had already been
discussed by Bessel, a great German astronomer; and the results
published in 1818, with a title that well showed the estimation in
which he held those materials: <i>Fundamenta Astronomiæ pro anno</i>

<h4 id="neptune"><i>The Discovery of Neptune.</i></h4>
<p>The theory of gravitation was destined to receive a confirmation
more striking than any which could arise from any explanation, however
perfect, given by the motions of a known planet; namely, in revealing
the existence of an unknown planet, disclosed to astronomers by the
attraction which it exerted upon a known one. The story of the
discovery of Neptune by the calculations of Mr. Adams and M. Le
Verrier was partly told in the former edition of this History. I had
there stated (vol. ii. p. 306) that “a deviation of observation from
the theory occurs at the very extremity of the solar system, and that
its existence appears to be beyond doubt. Uranus does not conform to
the Tables calculated for him on the theory of gravitation. In 1821,
Bouvard said in the Preface to the Tables of this Planet, “the
formation of these Tables offers to us this alternative, that we
cannot satisfy modern observations to the requisite degree of
precision without making our Tables deviate from the ancient
observations.” But when we have done this, there is still a
discordance between the Tables and the more modern observations, and
this discordance goes on increasing. At present the Tables make the
Planet come upon the meridian about eight seconds later than he really
does. This discrepancy has turned the thoughts of astronomers to the
effects which would result from a planet external to Uranus. It
appears that the observed motion would be explained by applying a
planet at twice the distance of Uranus from the Sun to exercise a
disturbing force, and it is found that the present longitude of this
disturbing body must be about 325 degrees.</p>
<p>I added, “M. Le Verrier (<i>Comptes Rendus</i>, Jan. 1, 1846) and,
as I am informed by the Astronomer Royal, Mr. Adams, of St. John’s
College, Cambridge, have both arrived independently at this
result.”</p>
<p>To this Edition I added a Postscript, dated, Nov. 7, 1846, in which
I said:</p>
<p>“The planet exterior to Uranus, of which the existence was inferred
by M. Le Verrier and Mr. Adams from the motions of Uranus (vol. ii.
Note (<span class="sc">l</span>.)), has since been discovered. This
confirmation of calculations founded upon the doctrine of universal
gravitation, may be looked upon as the most remarkable event of the
kind since the return of Halley’s comet in 1757  and in some respects,
as a more striking event <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page555">555</a></span> even than that; inasmuch as the new
planet had never been seen at all, and was discovered by
mathematicians entirely by their feeling of its influence, which they
perceived through the organ of mathematical calculation.</p>
<p>“There can be no doubt that to M. Le Verrier belongs the glory of
having first published a prediction of the place and appearance of the
new planet, and of having thus occasioned its discovery by
astronomical observers. M. Le Verrier’s first prediction was published
in the <i>Comptes Rendus de l’Acad. des Sciences</i>, for <i>June</i>
1, 1846 (not <i>Jan.</i> 1, as erroneously printed in my Note). A
subsequent paper on the subject was read Aug. 31. The planet was seen
by M. Galle, at the Observatory of Berlin, on September 23, on which
day he had received an express application from M. Le Verrier,
recommending him to endeavor to recognize the stranger by its having a
visible disk. Professor Challis, at the Observatory of Cambridge, was
looking out for the new planet from July 29, and saw it on August 4,
and again on August 12, but without recognizing it, in consequence of
his plan of not comparing his observations till he had accumulated a
greater number of them. On Sept. 29, having read for the first time M.
Le Verrier’s second paper, he altered his plan, and paid attention to
the physical appearance rather than the position of the star. On that
very evening, not having then heard of M. Galle’s discovery, he
singled out the star by its seeming to have a disk.</p>
<p>“M. Le Verrier’s mode of discussing the circumstances of Uranus’s
motion, and inferring the new planet from these circumstances, is in
the highest degree sagacious and masterly. Justice to him cannot
require that the contemporaneous, though unpublished, labors of Mr.
Adams, of St John’s College, Cambridge, should not also be recorded.
Mr. Adams made his first calculations to account for the anomalies in
the motion of Uranus, on the hypothesis of a more distant planet, in
1843. At first he had not taken into account the earlier Greenwich
observations; but these were supplied to him by the Astronomer Royal,
in 1844. In September, 1845, Mr. Adams communicated to Professor
Challis values of the elements of the supposed disturbing body;
namely, its mean distance, mean longitude at a given epoch, longitude
of perihelion, eccentricity of orbit, and mass. In the next month, he
communicated to the Astronomer Royal values of the same elements,
somewhat corrected. The note (<span class="sc">l</span>.), vol. ii.,
of the present work (2d Ed.), in which the names of MM. Le Verrier and
Adams are mentioned in conjunction, was in the press in August, 1846,
a <span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page556">556</a></span> month before
the planet was seen. As I have stated in the text, Mr. Adams and M. Le
Verrier assigned to the unseen planet nearly the same position; they
also assigned to it nearly the same mass; namely, 2½ times the mass of
Uranus. And hence, supposing the density to be not greater than that
of Uranus, it followed that the visible diameter would be about 3”, an
apparent magnitude not much smaller than Uranus himself.</p>
<p>“M. Le Verrier has mentioned for the new planet the name
<i>Neptunus</i>; and probably, deference to his authority as its
discoverer, will obtain general currency for this name.”</p>
<p>Mr. Airy has given a very complete history of the circumstances
attending the discovery of Neptune, in the Memoirs of the Astronomical
Society (read November 13, 1846). In this he shows that the
probability of some disturbing body beyond Uranus had suggested itself
to M. A. Bouvard and Mr. Hussey as early as 1834. Mr. Airy himself
then thought that the time was not ripe for making out the nature of
any external action on the planets. But Mr. Adams soon afterwards
proceeded to work at the problem. As early as 1841 (as he himself
informs me) he conjectured the existence of a planet exterior to
Uranus, and recorded in a memorandum his design of examining its
effect; but deferred the calculations till he had completed his
preparations for the University examination which he was to undergo in
January, 1843, in order to receive the Degree of Bachelor of Arts. He
was the Senior Wrangler of that occasion, and soon afterwards
proceeded to carry his design into effect; applying to the Astronomer
Royal for recorded observations which might aid him in his task. On
one of the last days of October, 1845, Mr. Adams went to the
Observatory at Greenwich; and finding the Astronomer Royal abroad, he
left there a paper containing the elements of the extra-Uranian
Planet: the longitude was in this paper stated as 323½ degrees. It
was, as we have seen, in June, 1846, that M. Le Verrier’s Memoir
appeared, in which he assigned to the disturbing body a longitude of
325 degrees. The coincidence was striking. “I cannot sufficiently
express,” says Mr. Airy, “the feeling of delight and satisfaction
which I received from the Memoir of M. Le Verrier.” This feeling
communicated itself to others. Sir John Herschel said in September,
1846, at a meeting of the British Association at Southampton, “We see
it (the probable new planet) as Columbus saw America from the shores
of Spain. Its movements have been felt, trembling along the
far-reaching line of our analysis, with a certainty hardly inferior to
that of ocular demonstration.” <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page557">557</a></span></p>
<p>In truth, at the moment when this was uttered, the new Planet had
already been seen by Professor Challis; for, as we have said, he had
seen it in the early part of August. He had included it in the net
which he had cast among the stars for this very purpose; but employing
a slow and cautious process, he had deferred for a time that
examination of his capture which would have enabled him to detect the
object sought. As soon as he received M. Le Verrier’s paper of August
31 on September 29, he was so much impressed with the sagacity and
clearness of the limitations of the field of observation there laid
down, that he instantly changed his plan of observation, and noted the
planet, as an object having a visible disk, on the evening of the same
day.</p>
<p>In this manner the theory of gravitation predicted and produced the
discovery. Thus to predict unknown facts found afterwards to be true,
is, as I have said, a confirmation of a theory which in impressiveness
and value goes beyond any explanation of known facts. It is a
confirmation which has only occurred a few times in the history of
science; and in the case only of the most refined and complete
theories, such as those of Astronomy and Optics. The mathematical
skill which was requisite in order to arrive at such a discovery, may
in some measure be judged of by the account which we have had to give
of the previous mathematical progress of the theory of gravitation. It
there appeared that the lives of many of the most acute,
clear-sighted, and laborious of mankind, had been employed for
generations in solving the problem. Given the planetary bodies, to
find their mutual perturbations: but here we have the inverse
problem&#8212;Given the perturbations, to find the planets.<a
id="fnanchor50-A" href="#note50-A"><span
class="fnanchor">50</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note50-A"
href="#fnanchor50-A">50</a></span> This may be called the
<em>inverse</em> problem with reference to the older and more familiar
problem; but we may remark that the usual phraseology of the Problem
of Central Forces differs from this analogy. In Newton’s
<i>Principia</i>, the earlier Sections, in which the motion is given
to find the force, are spoken of as containing the Direct Problem of
Central Forces: the Eighth Section of the First Book, where the Force
is given to find the orbit, is spoken of as containing the
<i>Inverse</i> Problem of Central Forces.</div>
<h4 id="minor"><i>The Minor Planets.</i></h4>
<p>The discovery of the Minor Planets which revolve between the orbits
of Mars and Jupiter was not a consequence or confirmation of the
Newtonian theory. That theory gives no reason for the distance of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page558">558</a></span> the Planets
from the Sun; nor does any theory yet devised give such reason. But an
empirical formula proposed by the Astronomer Bode of Berlin, gives a
law of these distances (<i>Bode’s Law</i>), which, to make it
coherent, requires a planet between Mars and Jupiter. With such an
addition, the distance of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, the Missing
Planet, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus, are nearly as the numbers</p><p

had also a share in the discovery of Neptune. According to the law, a
planet beyond Uranus may be expected to be at the distance represented
by 388. Mr. Adams and M. Le Verrier both of them began by assuming a
distance of nearly this magnitude for the Planet which they sought;
that is, a distance more than 38 times the earth’s distance. It was
found afterwards that the distance of Neptune is only 30 times that of
the earth; yet the assumption was of essential use in obtaining the
result  and Mr. Airy remarks that the history of the discovery shows
the importance of using any received theory as far as it will go, even
if the theory can claim no higher merit than that of being
plausible.<a id="fnanchor51-A" href="#note51-A"><span

Neptune, &amp;c., <i>Mem. Ast. Soc.</i>, vol. xvi. p. 414.</div>
<p>The discovery of Minor Planets in a certain region of the interval
between Mars and Jupiter has gone on to such an extent, that their
number makes them assume in a peculiar manner the character of
representatives of a Missing Planet. At first, as I have said in the
<a href="#v1page447">text</a>, it was supposed that all these portions
must pass through or near a common node; this opinion being founded on
the very bold doctrine, that the portions must at one time have been
united in one Planet, and must then have separated. At this node, as I
have stated, Olbers lay in wait for them, as for a hostile army at a
defile. Ceres, Pallas, and Juno had been discovered in this way in the
period from 1801 to 1804; and Vesta was caught in 1807. For a time the
chase for new planets in this region seemed to have exhausted the
stock. But after thirty-eight years, to the astonishment of
astronomers, they began to be again detected in extraordinary numbers.
In 1845, M. Hencke of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page559">559</a></span> Driessen discovered a fifth of these
planets, which was termed Astræa. In various quarters the chase was
resumed with great ardor. In 1847 were found Hebe, Iris, and Flora; in
1848, Metis; in 1849, Hygæa; in 1850, Parthenope, Victoria, and
Egeria; in 1861, Irene and Eunomia; in 1852, Psyche, Thetis,
Melpomene, Fortuna, Massilia, Lutetia, Calliope. To these we have now
(at the close of 1856) to add <em>nineteen</em> others; making up the
whole number of these Minor Planets at present known to
<em>forty-two</em>.</p>
<p>As their enumeration will show, the ancient practice has been
continued of giving to the Planets mythological names. And for a time,
till the numbers became too great, each of the Minor Planets was
designated in astronomical books by some symbol appropriate to the
character of the mythological person; as from ancient times Mars has
been denoted by a mark indicating a spear, and Venus by one
representing a looking-glass. Thus, when a Minor Planet was discovered
at London in 1851, the year in which the peace of the world was, in a
manner, celebrated by the Great Exhibition of the Products of All
Nations, held at that metropolis, the name <i>Irene</i> was given to
the new star, as a memorial of the auspicious time of its discovery.
And it was agreed, for awhile, that its symbol should be a dove with
an olive-branch. But the vast multitude of the Minor Planets, as
discovery went on, made any mode of designation, except a numerical
one, practically inconvenient. They are now denoted by a small circle
inclosing a figure in the order of their discovery. Thus, <i>Ceres</i>
is &#9461;, <i>Irene</i> is &#9325;, and <i>Isis</i> is &#12983;.</p>
<p>The rapidity with which these discoveries were made was owing in
part to the formation of star-maps, in which all known fixed stars
being represented, the existence of a new and movable star might be
recognized by comparison of the sky with the map. These maps were
first constructed by astronomers of different countries at the
suggestion of the Academy of Berlin; but they have since been greatly
extended, and now include much smaller stars than were originally laid
down.</p>
<p>I will mention the number of planets discovered in each year. After
the start was once made, by Hencke’s discovery of Astræa in 1845, the
same astronomer discovered Hebe in 1847; and in the same year Mr.
Hind, of London, discovered two others, Iris and Flora. The years 1848
and 1849 each supplied one; the year 1850, three; 1851, two; 1852 was
marked by the extraordinary discovery of <em>eight</em> new members of
the planetary system. The year 1853 supplied four; 1854, six; 1855,
four; and 1856 has already given us five. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page560">560</a></span></p>
<p>These discoveries have been distributed among the observatories of
Europe. The bright sky of Naples has revealed seven new planets to the
telescope of Signer Gasparis. Marseilles has given us one; Germany,
four, discovered by M. Luther at Bilk; Paris has furnished seven; and
Mr. Hind, in Mr. Bishop’s private observatory in London,
notwithstanding our turbid skies, has discovered no less than ten
planets; and there also Mr. Marth discovered &#12889; Amphitrite. Mr.
Graham, at the private observatory of Mr. Cooper, in Ireland,
discovered &#9469; Metis.</p>
<p>America has supplied its planet, namely &#12891; Euphrosyne,
discovered by Mr. Ferguson at Washington  and the most recent of these
discoveries is that by Mr. Pogson, of Oxford, who has found the
forty-second of these Minor Planets, which has been named Isis.<a

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note52-A"
href="#fnanchor52-A">52</a></span> I take this list from a Memoir of
M. Bruhns, Berlin, 1856.</div>
<p>I may add that it appears to follow from the best calculations that
the total mass of all these bodies is very small. Herschel reckoned
the diameters of Ceres at 35, and of Pallas at 26 miles. It has since
been calculated<a id="fnanchor53-A" href="#note53-A"><span
class="fnanchor">53</span></a> that some of them are smaller still;
Victoria having a diameter of 9 miles, Lutetia of 8, and Atalanta of
little more than 4. It follows from this that the whole mass would
probably be less than the sixth part of our moon. Hence their
perturbing effects on each other or on other planets are null; but
they are not the less disturbed by the action of the other planets,
and especially of Jupiter.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note53-A"
href="#fnanchor53-A">53</a></span> Bruhns, as above.</div>
<h4><i>Anomalies in the Action of Gravitation.</i></h4>
<p>The complete and exact manner in which the doctrine of gravitation
explains the motions of the Comets as well as of the Planets, has made
astronomers very bold in proposing hypotheses to account for any
deviations from the motion which the theory requires. Thus Encke’s
Comet is found to have its motion accelerated by about one-eighth of a
day in every revolution. This result was conceived to be established
by former observations, and is confirmed by the facts of the
appearance of 1852.<a id="fnanchor54-A" href="#note54-A"><span
class="fnanchor">54</span></a> The hypothesis which is proposed in
order to explain this result is, that the Comet moves in a resisting
medium, which makes it fall inwards from its path, towards the Sun,
and thus, by narrowing its orbit, diminishes its periodic time. On the
other hand, M. Le Verrier has found that Mercury’s mean motion has
gone on diminishing; <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page561">561</a></span> as if the planet were, in the progress
of his revolutions, receding further from the Sun. This is explained,
if we suppose that there is, in the region of Mercury, a resisting
medium which moves round the Sun in the same direction as the Planets
move. Evidence of a kind of nebulous disk surrounding the Sun, and
extending beyond the orbits of Mercury and Venus, appears to be
afforded us by the phenomenon called the <i>Zodiacal Light</i>; and as
the Sun itself rotates on its axis, it is most probable that this kind
of atmosphere rotates also.<a id="fnanchor55-A" href="#note55-A"><span
class="fnanchor">55</span></a> On the other hand, M. Le Verrier
conceives that the Comets which now revolve within the ordinary
planetary limits have not always done so, but have been caught and
detained by the Planets among which they move. In this way the action
of Jupiter has brought the Comets of Faye and Vico into their present
limited orbits, as it drew the Comet of Lexell out of its known orbit,
when the Comet passed over the Planet in 1779, since which time it has
not been seen.</p>

de Paris</i>, vol. i. p. 89.</div>
<p>Among the examples of the boldness with which astronomers assume
the doctrine of gravitation even beyond the limits of the solar system
to be so entirely established, that hypotheses may and must be assumed
to explain any apparent irregularity of motion, we may reckon the mode
of accounting for certain supposed irregularities in the proper motion
of Sirius, which has been proposed by Bessel, and which M. Peters
thinks is proved to be true by his recent researches (<i>Astr.
Nach.</i> xxxi. p. 219, and xxxii. p. 1). The hypothesis is, that
Sirius has a companion star, dark, and therefore invisible to us; and
that the two, revolving round their common centre as the system moves
on, the motion of Sirius is seen to be sometimes quicker and sometimes
slower.</p>
<h4 id="density"><i>The Earth’s Density.</i></h4>
<p>“Cavendish’s experiment,” as it is commonly called&#8212;the
measure of the attractions of manageable masses by the torsion
balance, in order to determine the density of the Earth&#8212;has been
repeated recently by Professor Reich at Freiberg, and by Mr. Baily in
England, with great attention to the means of attaining accuracy.
Professor Reich’s result for the density of the Earth is 5·44; Mr.
Baily’s is 5·92. Cavendish’s result was 5·48; according to recent
revisions<a id="fnanchor56-A" href="#note56-A"><span
class="fnanchor">56</span></a> it is 5·52.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note56-A"
href="#fnanchor56-A">56</a></span> The calculation has been revised by
M. Edward Schmidt. Humboldt’s <i>Kosmos</i>, ii. p. 425.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v1page562">562</a></span> But the
statical effect of the attraction of manageable masses, or even of
mountains, is very small. The effect of a small change in gravity may
be accumulated by being constantly repeated in the oscillations of a
pendulum, and thus may become perceptible. Mr. Airy attempted to
determine the density of the Earth by a method depending on this view.
A pendulum oscillating at the surface was to be compared with an equal
pendulum at a great depth below the surface. The difference of their
rates would disclose the different force of gravity at the two
positions; and hence, the density of the Earth. In 1826 and 1828, Mr.
Airy attempted this experiment at the copper mine of Dolcoath in
Cornwall, but failed from various causes. But in 1854, he resumed it
at the Harton coal mine in Durham, the depth of which is 1260 feet;
having in this new trial, the advantage of transmitting the time from
one station to the other by the instantaneous effect of galvanism,
instead of by portable watches. The result was a density of 6·56;
which is much larger than the preceding results, but, as Mr. Airy
holds, is entitled to compete with the others on at least equal
terms.</p>
<h4 id="tides"><i>Tides.</i></h4>
<p>I should be wanting in the expression of gratitude to those who
have practically assisted me in Researches on the Tides, if I did not
mention the grand series of Tide Observations made on the coast of
Europe and America in June, 1835, through the authority of the Board
of Admiralty, and the interposition of the late Duke of Wellington, at
that time Foreign Secretary. Tide observations were made for a
fortnight at all the Coast-guard stations of Great Britain and Ireland
in June, 1834; and these were repeated in June, 1835, with
corresponding observations on all the coasts of Europe, from the North
Cape of Norway to the Straits of Gibraltar; and from the mouth of the
St. Lawrence to the mouth of the Mississippi. The results of these
observations, which were very complete so far as the coast tides were
concerned, were given in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> for
1836.</p>
<p>Additional accuracy respecting the Tides of the North American
coast may be expected from the survey now going on under the direction
of Superintendent A. Bache. The Tides of the English Channel have been
further investigated, and the phenomena presented under a new point of
view by Admiral Beechey. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v1page563">563</a></span></p>
<p>The Tides of the Coast of Ireland have been examined with great
care by Mr. Airy. Numerous and careful observations were made with a
view, in the first instance, of determining what was to be regarded as
“the Level of the Sea;” but the results were discussed so as to bring
into view the laws and progress, on the Irish coast, of the various
inequalities of the Tides mentioned in Chap. iv. <a
href="#v1page457">Sect. 9</a> of this Book.</p>
<p>I may notice as one of the curious results of the Tide Observations
of 1836, that it appeared to me, from a comparison of the
Observations, that there must be a point in the German Ocean, about
midway between Lowestoft on the English coast, and the Brill on the
Dutch coast, where the tide would vanish: and this was ascertained to
be the case by observation; the observations being made by Captain
Hewett, then employed in a survey of that sea.</p>
<p><i>Cotidal Lines</i> supply, as I conceive, a good and simple
method of representing the progress and connection of
<em>littoral</em> tides. But to draw cotidal lines across oceans, is a
very precarious mode of representing the facts, except we had much
more knowledge on the subject than we at present possess. In the
<i>Phil. Trans.</i> for 1848, I have resumed the subject of the Tides
of the Pacific; and I have there expressed my opinion, that while the
littoral tides are produced by progressive waves, the oceanic tides
are more of the nature of stationary undulations.</p>
<p>But many points of this kind might be decided, and our knowledge on
this subject might be brought to a condition of completeness, if a
ship or ships were sent expressly to follow the phenomena of the Tides
from point to point, as the observations themselves might suggest a
course. Till this is done, our knowledge cannot be completed. Detached
and casual observations, made <i>aliud agendo</i>, can never carry us
much beyond the point where we at present are.</p>
<h4 id="double"><i>Double Stars.</i></h4>
<p>Sir John Herschel’s work, <a href="#v1page468">referred</a> to in
the History (2d Ed.) as then about to appear, was published in 1847.<a
id="fnanchor57-A" href="#note57-A"><span
class="fnanchor">57</span></a> In this work, besides a vast amount of
valuable observations and reasonings on other subjects <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page564">564</a></span> (as Nebulæ, the
Magnitude of Stars, and the like), the orbits of several double stars
are computed by the aid of the new observations. But Sir John
Herschel’s conviction on the point in question, the operation of the
Newtonian law of gravitation in the region of the stars, is expressed
perhaps more clearly in another work which he published in 1849.<a
id="fnanchor58-A" href="#note58-A"><span
class="fnanchor">58</span></a> He there speaks of Double Stars, and
especially of <i>gamma Virginis</i>, the one which has been most
assiduously watched, and has offered phenomena of the greatest
interest.<a id="fnanchor59-A" href="#note59-A"><span
class="fnanchor">59</span></a> He then finds that the two components
of this star revolve round each other in a period of 182 years; and
says that the elements of the calculated orbit represent the whole
series of recorded observations, comprising an angular movement of
nearly nine-tenths of a complete circuit, both in angle and distance,
with a degree of exactness fully equal to that of observation itself.
“No doubt can therefore,” he adds, “remain as to the <span
class="correction" title="emended from prevalance">prevalence</span>
in this remote system of the Newtonian Law of Gravitation.”</p>

<p>Yet M. Yvon de Villarceau has endeavored to show<a
id="fnanchor60-A" href="#note60-A"><span
class="fnanchor">60</span></a> that this conclusion, however probable,
is not yet proved. He holds, even for the Double Stars, which have
been most observed, the observations are only equivalent to seven or
eight really distinct data, and that seven data are not sufficient to
determine that an ellipse is described according to the Newtonian law.
Without going into the details of this reasoning, I may remark, that
the more rapid relative angular motion of the components of a Double
Star when they are more near each other, proves, as is allowed on all
hands, that they revolve under the influence of a mutual attractive
force, obeying the Keplerian Law of Areas. But that, whether this
force follows the law of the inverse square or some other law, can
hardly have been rigorously proved as yet, we may easily conceive,
when we recollect the manner in which that law was proved for the
Solar System. It was by means of an error of <em>eight minutes</em>,
observed by Tycho, that Kepler was enabled, as he justly boasted, to
reform the scheme of the Solar System,&#8212;to show, that is, that
the planetary orbits are ellipses with the sun in the focus. Now, the
observations of Double Stars cannot pretend to such accuracy as this;
and therefore the Keplerian theorem cannot, as yet, have been fully
demonstrated from those observations. But when we know <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page565">565</a></span> that Double Stars are
held together by a central force, to prove that this force follows a
different law from the only law which has hitherto been found to
obtain in the universe, and which obtains between all the known masses
of the universe, would require very clear and distinct evidence, of
which astronomers have as yet seen no trace.</p>

<i>Instruments.</i>&#8212;2. <i>Clocks.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IN</span> <a href="#clocks">page
473</a>, I have described the manner in which astronomers are able to
observe the transit of a star, and other astronomical phenomena, to
the exactness of a tenth of a second of time. The mode of observation
there described implies that the observer at the moment of observation
compares the impressions of the eye and of the ear. Now it is found
that the habit which the observer must form of doing this operates
differently in different observers, so that one observer notes the
same fact as happening a fraction of a second earlier or later than
another observer does; and this in every case. Thus, using the term
<i>equation</i>, as we use it in Astronomy, to express a correction by
which we get regularity from irregularity, there is a <i>personal
equation</i> belonging to this mode of observation, showing that it is
liable to error. Can this error be got rid of?</p>
<p>It is at any rate much diminished by a method of observation
recently introduced into observatories, and first practised in
America. The essential feature of this mode of observation consists in
combining the impression of sight with that of touch, instead of with
that of hearing. The observer at the moment of observation presses
with his finger so as to make a mark on a machine which by its motion
measures time with great accuracy and on a large scale; and thus small
intervals of time are made visible.</p>
<p>A universal, though not a necessary, part of this machinery, as
hitherto adopted, is, that a galvanic circuit has been employed in
conveying the impression from the finger to the part where time is
measured and marked. The facility with which galvanic wires can <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v1page566">566</a></span> thus lead the
impression by any path to any distance, and increase its force in any
degree, has led to this combination, and almost identification, of
observation by touch with its record by galvanism.</p>
<p>The method having been first used by Mr. Bond at Cambridge, in
North America, has been adopted elsewhere, and especially at
Greenwich, where it is used for all the instruments; and consequently
a collection of galvanic batteries is thus as necessary a part of the
apparatus of the establishment as its graduated circles and arcs.</p>

<h4 class="five"><i>The Secondary Mechanical Sciences.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IN</span> the sciences of Mechanics
and Physical Astronomy, Motion and Force are the direct and primary
objects of our attention. But there is another class of sciences in
which we endeavor to reduce phenomena, not evidently mechanical, to a
known dependence upon mechanical properties and laws. In the cases to
which I refer, the facts do not present themselves to the senses as
modifications of position and motion, but as <i>secondary
qualities</i>, which are found to be in some way derived from those
primary attributes. Also, in these cases the phenomena are reduced to
their mechanical laws and causes in a secondary manner; namely, by
treating them as the operation of a <em>medium</em> interposed between
the object and the organ of sense. These, then, we may call
<i>Secondary Mechanical Sciences</i>. The sciences of this kind which
require our notice are those which treat of the sensible qualities,
Sound, Light, and Heat; that is. Acoustics, Optics, and
Thermotics.</p>
<p>It will be recollected that our object is not by any means to give
a full statement of all the additions which have been successively
made to our knowledge on the subjects under review, or a complete list
of the persons by whom such additions have been made; but to present a
view of the progress of each of those branches of knowledge <em>as a
theoretical science</em>;&#8212;to point out the Epochs of the
discovery of those general principles which reduce many facts to one
theory; and to note all that is most characteristic and instructive in
the circumstances and persons which bear upon such Epochs. A history
of any science, written with such objects, will not need to be long;
but it will fail in its purpose altogether, if it do not distinctly
exhibit some well-marked and prominent features. <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page24">24</a></span></p>
<p>We begin our account of the Secondary Mechanical Sciences with
Acoustics, because the progress towards right theoretical views, was,
in fact, made much earlier in the science of Sound, than in those of
Light and of Heat; and also, because a clear comprehension of the
theory to which we are led in this case, is the best preparation for
the difficulties (by no means inconsiderable) of the reasonings of
theorists on the other subjects.</p>
<hr class="three space-above" />
<h3>CHAPTER I.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Prelude to the Solution of Problems in
Acoustics.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IN</span> some measure the true
theory of sound was guessed by very early speculators on the subject;
though undoubtedly conceived in a very vague and wavering manner. That
sound is caused by some motion of the sounding body, and conveyed by
some motion of the air to the ear, is an opinion which we trace to the
earliest times of physical philosophy. We may take Aristotle as the
best expounder of this stage of opinion. In his Treatise <i>On Sound
and Hearing</i>, he says, “Sound takes place when bodies strike the
air, not by the air having a <i>form</i> impressed upon it
(σχηματίζομενον), as some think, but by its being moved in a
corresponding manner; (probably he means in a manner corresponding to
the impulse;) the air being contracted, and expanded, and overtaken,
and again struck by the impulses of the breath and of the strings. For
when the breath falls upon and strikes the air which is next it, the
air is carried forwards with an impetus, and that which is contiguous
to the first is carried onwards; so that the same voice spreads every
way as far as the motion of the air takes place.”</p>
<p>As is the case with all such specimens of ancient physics,
different persons would find in such a statement very different
measures of truth and distinctness. The admirers of antiquity might
easily, by pressing the language closely, and using the light of
modern discovery, detect in this passage an exact account of the
production and propagation of sound: while others might maintain that
in Aristotle’s own mind, there were only vague notions, and verbal
generalizations. This <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page25">25</a></span> latter opinion is very emphatically
expressed by Bacon.<a id="fnanchor1-8" href="#note1-8"><span
class="fnanchor">1</span></a> “The collision or thrusting of air,
which they will have to be the cause of sound, neither denotes the
<i>form</i> nor the latent process of sound; but is a term of
ignorance and of superficial contemplation.” Nor can it be justly
denied, that an exact and distinct apprehension of the kind of motion
of the air by which sound is diffused, was beyond the reach of the
ancient philosophers, and made its way into the world long afterwards.
It was by no means easy to reconcile the nature of such motion with
obvious phenomena. For the process is not evident as motion; since, as
Bacon also observes,<a id="fnanchor2-8" href="#note2-8"><span
class="fnanchor">2</span></a> it does not visibly agitate the flame of
a candle, or a feather, or any light floating substance, by which the
slightest motions of the air are betrayed. Still, the persuasion that
sound is some motion of the air, continued to keep hold of men’s
minds, and acquired additional distinctness. The illustration employed
by Vitruvius, in the following passage, is even now one of the best we
can offer.<a id="fnanchor3-8" href="#note3-8"><span
class="fnanchor">3</span></a> “Voice is breath, flowing, and made
sensible to the hearing by striking the air. It moves in infinite
circumferences of circles, as when, by throwing a stone into still
water, you produce innumerable circles of waves, increasing from the
centre and spreading outwards, till the boundary of the space, or some
obstacle, prevents their outlines from going further. In the same
manner the voice makes its motion in circles. But in water the circle
moves breadthways upon a level plain; the voice proceeds in breadth,
and also successively ascends in height.”</p>

<p>Both the comparison, and the notice of the difference of the two
cases, prove the architect to have had very clear notions on the
subject; which he further shows by comparing the resonance of the
walls of a building to the disturbance of the outline of the waves of
water when they meet with a boundary, and are thrown back. “Therefore,
as in the outlines of waves in water, so in the voice, if no obstacle
interrupt the foremost, it does not disturb the second and the
following ones, so that all come to the ears of persons, whether high
up or low down, without resonance. But when they strike against
obstacles, the foremost, being thrown back, disturb the lines of those
which follow.” Similar analogies were employed by the ancients in
order to explain the occurrence of Echoes. Aristotle says,<a
id="fnanchor4-8" href="#note4-8"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a>
“An Echo takes place, when the air, being as one body in consequence
of the vessel which bounds it, and being prevented from being thrust
forwards, is reflected <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page26">26</a></span> back like a ball.” Nothing material was
added to such views till modern times.</p>

<p>Thus the first conjectures of those who philosophized concerning
sound, led them to an opinion concerning its causes and laws, which
only required to be distinctly understood, and traced to mechanical
principles, in order to form a genuine science of Acoustics. It was,
no doubt, a work which required a long time and sagacious reasoners,
to supply what was thus wanting; but still, in consequence of this
peculiar circumstance in the early condition of the prevalent doctrine
concerning sound, the history of Acoustics assumes a peculiar form.
Instead of containing, like the history of Astronomy or of Optics, a
series of generalizations, each including and rising above preceding
generalizations; in this case, the highest generalization is in view
from the first; and the object of the philosopher is to determine its
precise meaning and circumstances in each example. Instead of having a
series of inductive Truths, successively dawning on men’s minds, we
have a series of Explanations, in which certain experimental facts and
laws are reconciled, as to their mechanical principles and their
measures, with the general doctrine already in our possession. Instead
of having to travel gradually towards a great discovery, like
Universal Gravitation, or Luminiferous Undulations, we take our stand
upon acknowledged truths, the production and propagation of sound by
the motion of bodies and of air; and we connect these with other
truths, the laws of motion and the known properties of bodies, as, for
instance, their elasticity. Instead of <i>Epochs of Discovery</i>, we
have <i>Solutions of Problems</i>; and to these we must now
proceed.</p>
<p>We must, however, in the first place, notice that these Problems
include other subjects than the mere production and propagation of
sound generally. For such questions as these obviously
occur:&#8212;what are the laws and cause of the differences of
sounds;&#8212;of acute and grave, loud and low, continued and
instantaneous;&#8212;and, again, of the differences of articulate
sounds, and of the quality of different voices and different
instruments? The first of these questions, in particular, the real
nature of the difference of acute and grave sounds, could not help
attracting attention; since the difference of notes in this respect
was the foundation of one of the most remarkable mathematical sciences
of antiquity. Accordingly, we find attempts to explain this difference
in the ancient writers on music. In Ptolemy’s <i>Harmonics</i>, the
third Chapter of the first Book is entitled, “How the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page27">27</a></span> acuteness and graveness
of notes is produced;” and in this, after noting generally the
difference of sounds, and the causes of difference (which he states to
be the force of the striking body, the physical constitution of the
body struck, and other causes), he comes to the conclusion, that “the
things which produce acuteness in sounds, are a greater density and a
smaller size; the things which produce graveness, are a greater rarity
and a bulkier form.” He afterwards explains this so as to include a
considerable portion of truth. Thus he says, “That in strings, and in
pipes, other things remaining the same, those which are stopped at the
smaller distance from the bridge give the most acute note; and in
pipes, those notes which come through holes nearest to the mouth-hole
are most acute.” He even attempts a further generalization, and says
that the greater acuteness arises, in fact, from the body being more
tense; and that thus “hardness may counteract the effect of greater
density, as we see that brass produces a more acute sound than lead.”
But this author’s notions of tension, since they were applied so
generally as to include both the tension of a string, and the tension
of a piece of solid brass, must necessarily have been very vague. And
he seems to have been destitute of any knowledge of the precise nature
of the motion or impulse by which sound is produced; and, of course,
still more ignorant of the mechanical principles by which these
motions are explained. The notion of <em>vibrations</em> of the parts
of sounding bodies, does not appear to have been dwelt upon as an
essential circumstance; though in some cases, as in sounding strings,
the fact is very obvious. And the notion of vibrations of the air does
not at all appear in ancient writers, except so far as it may be
conceived to be implied in the comparison of aërial and watery waves,
which we have quoted from Vitruvius. It is however, very unlikely
that, even in the case of water, the motions of the particles were
distinctly conceived, for such conception is far from obvious.</p>
<p>The attempts to apprehend distinctly, and to explain mechanically,
the phenomena of sound, gave rise to a series of Problems, of which we
most now give a brief history. The questions which more peculiarly
constitute the Science of Acoustics, are the questions concerning
those motions or affections of the air by which it is the medium of
hearing. But the motions of sounding bodies have both so much
connexion with those of the medium, and so much resemblance to them,
that we shall include in our survey researches on that subject also.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page28">28</a></span></p>
<h3 class="space-above">CHAPTER II.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Problem of the Vibrations of Strings.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THAT</span> the continuation of sound
depends on a continued minute and rapid motion, a shaking or
trembling, of the parts of the sounding body, was soon seen. Thus
Bacon says,<a id="fnanchor5-8" href="#note5-8"><span
class="fnanchor">5</span></a> “The duration of the sound of a bell or
a string when struck, which appears to be prolonged and gradually
extinguished, does not proceed from the first percussion; but the
trepidation of the body struck perpetually generates a new sound. For
if that trepidation be prevented, and the bell or string be stopped,
the sound soon dies: as in <i>spinets</i>, as soon as the <i>spine</i>
is let fall so as to touch the string, the sound ceases.” In the case
of a stretched string, it is not difficult to perceive that the motion
is a motion back and forwards across the straight line which the
string occupies when at rest. The further examination of the
quantitative circumstances of this oscillatory motion was an obvious
problem; and especially after oscillations, though of another kind
(those of a pendulous body), had attracted attention, as they had done
in the school of Galileo. Mersenne, one of the promulgators of
Galileo’s philosophy in France, is the first author in whom I find an
examination of the details of this case (<i>Harmonicorum Liber</i>,
Paris, 1636). He asserts,<a id="fnanchor6-8" href="#note6-8"><span
class="fnanchor">6</span></a> that the differences and concords of
acute and grave sounds depend on the rapidity of vibrations, and their
ratio; and he proves this doctrine by a series of experimental
comparisons. Thus he finds<a id="fnanchor7-8" href="#note7-8"><span
class="fnanchor">7</span></a> that the note of a string is as its
length, by taking a string first twice, and then four times as long as
the original string, other things remaining the same. This, indeed,
was known to the ancients, and was the basis of that numerical
indication of the notes which the proposition expresses. Mersenne
further proceeds to show the effect of thickness and tension. He finds
(Prop. 7) that a string must be four times as thick as another, to
give the octave below; he finds, also (Prop. 8), that the tension must
be about four times as great in order to produce the octave above.
From these proportions various others are deduced, and the <i>law of
the</i> <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page29">29</a></span>
<i>phenomena</i> of this kind may be considered as determined.
Mersenne also undertook to <i>measure</i> the phenomena numerically,
that is to determine the number of vibrations of the string in each of
such cases; which at first might appear difficult, since it is
obviously impossible to count with the eye the passages of a sounding
string backwards and forwards. But Mersenne rightly assumed, that the
number of vibrations is the same so long as the tone is the same, and
that the ratios of the numbers of vibrations of different strings may
be determined from the numerical relations of their notes. He had,
therefore, only to determine the number of vibrations of one certain
string, or one known note, to know those of all others. He took a
musical string of three-quarters of a foot long, stretched with a
weight of six pounds and five eighths, which he found gave him by its
vibrations a certain standard note in his organ: he found that a
string of the same material and tension, fifteen feet, that is, twenty
times as long, made ten recurrences in a second; and he inferred that
the number of vibrations of the shorter string must also be twenty
times as great; and thus such a string must make in one second of time
two hundred vibrations.</p>

href="#fnanchor7-8">7</a></span> L. ii. Prop. 6.</div>
<p>This determination of Mersenne does not appear to have attracted
due notice; but some time afterwards attempts were made to ascertain
the connexion between the sound and its elementary pulsations in a
more direct manner. Hooke, in 1681, produced sounds by the striking of
the teeth of brass wheels,<a id="fnanchor8-8" href="#note8-8"><span
class="fnanchor">8</span></a> and Stancari, in 1706, by whirling round
a large wheel in air, showed, before the Academy of Bologna, how the
number of vibrations in a given note might be known. Sauveur, who,
though deaf for the first seven years of his life, was one of the
greatest promoters of the science of sound, and gave it its name of
<i>Acoustics</i>, endeavored also, about the same time, to determine
the number of vibrations of a standard note, or, as he called it,
Fixed Sound. He employed two methods, both ingenious and both
indirect. The first was the method of <i>beats</i>. Two organ-pipes,
which form a discord, are often heard to produce a kind of
<i>howl</i>, or <i>wavy</i> noise, the sound swelling and declining at
small intervals of time. This was readily and rightly ascribed to the
coincidences of the pulsations of sound of the two notes after certain
cycles. Thus, if the number of vibrations of the notes were as fifteen
to sixteen in the same time, every fifteenth vibration of the one
would coincide with every <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page30">30</a></span> sixteenth vibration of the other, while
all the intermediate vibrations of the two tones would, in various
degrees, disagree with each other; and thus every such cycle, of
fifteen and sixteen vibrations, might be heard as a separate beat of
sound. Now, Sauveur wished to take a case in which these beats were so
slow as to be counted,<a id="fnanchor9-8" href="#note9-8"><span
class="fnanchor">9</span></a> and in which the ratio of the vibrations
of the notes was known from a knowledge of their musical relations.
Thus if the two notes form an interval of a semitone, their ratio will
be that above supposed, fifteen to sixteen; and if the beats be found
to be six in a second, we know that, in that time, the graver note
makes ninety and the acuter ninety-six vibrations. In this manner
Sauveur found that an open organ-pipe, five feet long, gave one
hundred vibrations in a second.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note8-8"
href="#fnanchor8-8">8</a></span> <i>Life</i>, p. xxiii.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note9-8"
href="#fnanchor9-8">9</a></span> <i>Ac. Sc. Hist.</i> 1700, p.
131.</div>
<p>Sauveur’s other method is more recondite, and approaches to a
mechanical view of the question.<a id="fnanchor10-8"
href="#note10-8"><span class="fnanchor">10</span></a> He proceeded on
this basis; a string, horizontally stretched, cannot be drawn into a
mathematical straight line, but always hangs in a very flat curve, or
<i>festoon</i>. Hence Sauveur assumed that its transverse vibrations
may be conceived to be identical with the lateral swingings of such a
festoon. Observing that the string C, in the middle of a harpsichord,
hangs in such a festoon to the amount of <span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>323</sub></span>rd of an inch, he
calculates, by the laws of pendulums, the time of oscillation, and
finds it <span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>122</sub></span>nd of a second. Thus this
C, his <i>fixed note</i>, makes one hundred and twenty-two vibrations
in a second. It is curious that this process, seemingly so arbitrary,
is capable of being justified on mechanical principles; though we can
hardly give the author credit for the views which this justification
implies. It is, therefore, easy to understand that it agreed with
other experiments, in the laws which it gave for the dependence of the
tone on the length and tension.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note10-8"
href="#fnanchor10-8">10</a></span> <i>Ac. Sc. Hist.</i> 1713.</div>
<p>The problem of satisfactorily explaining this dependence, on
mechanical principles, naturally pressed upon the attention of
mathematicians when the law of the phenomena was thus completely
determined by Mersenne and Sauveur. It was desirable to show that both
the circumstances and the measure of the phenomena were such as known
mechanical causes and laws would explain. But this problem, as might
be expected, was not attacked till mechanical principles, and the
modes of applying them, had become tolerably familiar.</p>
<p>As the vibrations of a string are produced by its tension, it
appeared to be necessary, in the first place, to determine the law of
the tension <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page31">31</a></span> which
is called into action by the motion of the string; for it is manifest
that, when the string is drawn aside from the straight line into which
it is stretched, there arises an additional tension, which aids in
drawing it back to the straight line as soon as it is let go. Hooke
(<i>On Spring</i>, 1678) determined the law of this additional
tension, which he expressed in his noted formula, “Ut tensio sic vis,”
the Force is as the Tension; or rather, to express his meaning more
clearly, the Force of tension is as the Extension, or, in a string, as
the increase of length. But, in reality, this principle, which is
important in many acoustical problems, is, in the one now before us,
unimportant; the force which urges the string towards the straight
line, depends, with such small extensions as we have now to consider,
not on the extension, but on the curvature; and the power of treating
the mathematical difficulty of curvature, and its mechanical
consequences, was what was requisite for the solution of this
problem.</p>
<p>The problem, in its proper aspect, was first attacked and mastered
by Brook Taylor, an English mathematician of the school of Newton, by
whom the solution was published in 1715, in his <i>Methodus
Incrementorum</i>. Taylor’s solution was indeed imperfect, for it only
pointed out a form and a mode of vibration, with which the string
<em>might</em> move consistently with the laws of mechanics; not the
mode in which it <em>must</em> move, supposing its form to be any
whatever. It showed that the curve might be of the nature of that
which is called <i>the companion to the cycloid</i>; and, on the
supposition of the curve of the string being of this form, the
calculation confirmed the previously established laws by which the
tone, or the time of vibration, had been discovered to depend on the
length, tension, and bulk of the string. The mathematical
incompleteness of Taylor’s reasoning must not prevent us from looking
upon his solution of the problem as the most important step in the
progress of this part of the subject: for the difficulty of applying
mechanical principles to the question being once overcome, the
extension and correction of the application was sure to be undertaken
by succeeding mathematicians; and, accordingly, this soon happened. We
may add, moreover, that the subsequent and more general solutions
require to be considered with reference to Taylor’s, in order to
apprehend distinctly their import; and further, that it was almost
evident to a mathematician, even before the general solution had
appeared, that the dependence of the time of vibration on the length
and tension, would be the same in the general case as in the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page32">32</a></span> Taylorian curve; so
that, for the ends of physical philosophy, the solution was not very
incomplete.</p>
<p>John Bernoulli, a few years afterwards,<a id="fnanchor11-8"
href="#note11-8"><span class="fnanchor">11</span></a> solved the
problem of vibrating chords on nearly the same principles and
suppositions as Taylor; but a little later (in 1747), the next
generation of great mathematicians, D’Alembert, Euler, and Daniel
Bernoulli, applied the increased powers of analysis to give generality
to the mode of treating this question; and especially the calculus of
partial differentials, invented for this purpose. But at this epoch,
the discussion, so far as it bore on physics, belonged rather to the
history of another problem, which comes under our notice <a
href="#b8-4">hereafter</a>, that of the composition of vibrations; we
shall, therefore, defer the further history of the problem of
vibrating strings, till we have to consider it in connexion with new
experimental facts.</p>

<span class="sc">Problem of the Propagation of Sound.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">WE</span> have seen that the ancient
philosophers, for the most part, held that sound was transmitted, as
well as produced, by some motion of the air, without defining what
kind of motion this was; that some writers, however, applied to it a
very happy similitude, the expansive motion of the circular waves
produced by throwing a stone into still water; but that
notwithstanding, some rejected this mode of conception, as, for
instance, Bacon, who ascribed the transmission of sound to certain
“spiritual species.”</p>
<p>Though it was an obvious thought to ascribe the motion of sound to
some motion of air; to conceive what kind of motion could and did
produce this effect, must have been a matter of grave perplexity at
the time of which we are speaking; and is far from easy to most
persons even now. We may judge of the difficulty of forming this
conception, when we recollect that John Bernoulli the younger<a
id="fnanchor12-8" href="#note12-8"><span
class="fnanchor">12</span></a> declared, that he could not understand
Newton’s proposition on this subject. The difficulty consists in this;
that the movement of the parts of air, in which sound consists,
travels along, but that the parts <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page33">33</a></span> of air themselves do not so travel.
Accordingly Otto Guericke,<a id="fnanchor13-8" href="#note13-8"><span
class="fnanchor">13</span></a> the inventor of the air-pump, asks,
“How can sound be conveyed by the motion of the air? when we find that
it is better conveyed through air that is still, than when there is a
wind.” We may observe, however, that he was partly misled by finding,
as he thought, that a bell could be heard in the vacuum of his
air-pump; a result which arose, probably, from some imperfection in
his apparatus.</p>

<p>Attempts were made to determine, by experiment, the circumstances
of the motion of sound; and especially its velocity. Gassendi<a
id="fnanchor14-8" href="#note14-8"><span
class="fnanchor">14</span></a> was one of the first who did this. He
employed fire-arms for the purpose, and thus found the velocity to be
1473 Paris feet in a second. Roberval found a velocity so small (560
feet) that it threw uncertainty upon the rest, and affected Newton’s
reasonings subsequently.<a id="fnanchor15-8" href="#note15-8"><span
class="fnanchor">15</span></a> Cassini, Huyghens, Picard, Römer, found
a velocity of 1172 Paris feet, which is more accurate than the former.
Gassendi had been surprised to find that the velocity with which
sounds travel, is the same whether they are loud or gentle.</p>

<p>The explanation of this constant velocity of sound, and of its
amount, was one of the problems of which a solution was given in the
Great Charter of modern science, Newton’s <i>Principia</i> (1687).
There, for the first time, were explained the real nature of the
motions and mutual action of the parts of the air through which sound
is transmitted. It was shown<a id="fnanchor16-8"
href="#note16-8"><span class="fnanchor">16</span></a> that a body
vibrating in an elastic medium, will propagate <em>pulses</em> through
the medium; that is, the parts of the medium will move forwards and
backwards, and this motion will affect successively those parts which
are at a greater and greater distance from the origin of motion. The
parts, in going forwards, produce condensation; in returning to their
first places, they allow extension; and the play of the elasticities
developed by these expansions and contractions, supplies the forces
which continue to propagate the motion.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note16-8"
href="#fnanchor16-8">16</a></span> Newt. <i>Prin.</i> B. ii. P.
43.</div>
<p>The idea of such a motion as this, is, as we have said, far from
easy to apprehend distinctly: but a distinct apprehension of it is a
step essential to the physical part of the sciences now under notice;
for it is by means of such <i>pulses</i>, or <i>undulations</i>, that
not only sound, but light, and probably heat, are propagated. We
constantly meet with evidence of the difficulty which men have in
conceiving this undulatory motion, and in separating it from a local
motion of the medium as a <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page34">34</a></span> mass. For instance, it is not easy at
first to conceive the waters of a great river flowing constantly
<i>down</i> towards the sea, while waves are rolling <i>up</i> the
very same part of the stream; and while the great elevation, which
makes the tide, is travelling from the sea perhaps with a velocity of
fifty miles an hour. The motion of such a wave, or elevation, is
distinct from any stream, and is of the nature of undulations in
general. The parts of the fluid stir for a short time and for a small
distance, so as to accumulate themselves on a neighboring part, and
then retire to their former place; and this movement affects the parts
in the order of their places. Perhaps if the reader looks at a field
of standing corn when gusts of wind are sweeping over it in visible
waves, he will have his conception of this matter aided; for he will
see that here, where each ear of grain is anchored by its stalk, there
can be no permanent local motion of the substance, but only a
successive stooping and rising of the separate straws, producing
hollows and waves, closer and laxer strips of the crowded ears.</p>
<p>Newton had, moreover, to consider the mechanical consequences which
such condensations and rarefactions of the elastic medium, air, would
produce in the parts of the fluid itself. Employing known laws of the
elasticity of air, he showed, in a very remarkable proposition,<a
id="fnanchor17-8" href="#note17-8"><span
class="fnanchor">17</span></a> the law according to which the
particles of air might vibrate. We may observe, that in this solution,
as in that of the vibrating string already mentioned, a rule was
exhibited according to which the particles <em>might</em> oscillate,
but not the law to which they <em>must</em> conform. It was proved
that, by taking the motion of each particle to be perfectly similar to
that of a pendulum, the forces, developed by contraction and
expansion, were precisely such as the motion required; but it was not
shown that no other type of oscillation would give rise to the same
accordance of force and motion. Newton’s reasoning also gave a
determination of the speed of propagation of the pulses: it appeared
that sound ought to travel with the velocity which a body would
acquire by falling freely through half <i>the height of a homogeneous
atmosphere</i>; “the height of a homogeneous atmosphere” being the
height which the air must have, in order to produce, at the earth’s
surface, the actual atmospheric pressure, supposing no diminution of
density to take place in ascending. This height is about 29,000 feet;
and hence it followed that the velocity was 968 feet. This velocity is
really considerably less than that of sound; but at the time of which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page35">35</a></span> we speak, no
accurate measure had been established; and Newton persuaded himself,
by experiments made in the cloister of Trinity College, his residence,
that his calculation was not far from the fact. When, afterwards, more
exact experiments showed the velocity to be 1142 English feet, Newton
attempted to explain the difference by various considerations, none of
which were adequate to the purpose;&#8212;as, the dimensions of the
solid particles of which the fluid air consists;&#8212;or the vapors
which are mixed with it. Other writers offered other suggestions; but
the true solution of the difficulty was reserved for a period
considerably subsequent.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note17-8"
href="#fnanchor17-8">17</a></span> <i>Princ.</i> B. ii. P. 48.</div>
<p>Newton’s calculation of the motion of sound, though logically
incomplete, was the great step in the solution of the problem; for
mathematicians could not but presume that his result was not
restricted to the hypothesis on which he had obtained it; and the
extension of the solution required only mere ordinary talents. The
logical defect of his solution was assailed, as might have been
expected. Cranmer (professor at Geneva), in 1741, conceived that he
was destroying the conclusiveness of Newton’s reasoning, by showing
that it applied equally to other modes of oscillation. This, indeed,
contradicted the enunciation of the 48th Prop. of the Second Book of
the <i>Principia</i>; but it confirmed and extended all the general
results of the demonstration; for it left even the velocity of sound
unaltered, and thus showed that the velocity did not depend
mechanically on the type of the oscillation. But the satisfactory
establishment of this physical generalization was to be supplied from
the vast generalizations of analysis, which mathematicians were now
becoming able to deal with. Accordingly this task was performed by the
great master of analytical generalization, Lagrange, in 1759, when, at
the age of twenty-three, he and two friends published the first volume
of the <i>Turin Memoirs</i>. Euler, as his manner was, at once
perceived the merit of the new solution, and pursued the subject on
the views thus suggested. Various analytical improvements and
extensions were introduced into the solution by the two great
mathematicians; but none of these at all altered the formula by which
the velocity of sound was expressed; and the discrepancy between
calculation and observation, about one-sixth of the whole, which had
perplexed Newton, remained still unaccounted for.</p>
<p id="soundvelocity">The merit of satisfactorily explaining this
discrepancy belongs to Laplace. He was the first to remark<a
id="fnanchor18-8" href="#note18-8"><span
class="fnanchor">18</span></a> that the common law of the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page36">36</a></span> changes of elasticity
in the air, as dependent on its compression, cannot be applied to
those rapid vibrations in which sound consists, since the sudden
compression produces a degree of heat which additionally increases the
elasticity. The ratio of this increase depended on the experiments by
which the relation of heat and air is established. Laplace, in 1816,
published<a id="fnanchor19-8" href="#note19-8"><span
class="fnanchor">19</span></a> the theorem on which the correction
depends. On applying it, the calculated velocity of sound agreed very
closely with the best antecedent experiments, and was confirmed by
more exact ones instituted for that purpose.</p>

<p>This step completes the solution of the problem of the propagation
of sound, as a mathematical induction, obtained from, and verified by,
facts. Most of the discussions concerning points of analysis to which
the investigations on this subject gave rise, as, for instance, the
admissibility of <i>discontinuous functions</i> into the solutions of
partial differential equations, belong to the history of pure
mathematics. Those which really concern the physical theory of sound
may be referred to the problem of the motion of air in tubes, to which
we shall <a href="#b8-5">soon</a> have to proceed; but we must first
speak of another form which the problem of vibrating strings
assumed.</p>
<p>It deserves to be noticed that the ultimate result of the study of
the undulations of fluids seems to show that the comparison of the
motion of air in the diffusion of sound with the motion of circular
waves from a centre in water, which is mentioned at the beginning of
this chapter, though pertinent in a certain way, is not exact. It
appears by Mr. Scott’s recent investigations concerning waves,<a
id="fnanchor20-8" href="#note20-8"><span
class="fnanchor">20</span></a> that the circular waves are oscillating
waves of the Second order, and are <i>gregarious</i>. The sound-wave
seems rather to resemble the great solitary Wave of Translation of the
First order, of which we have already spoken in Book vi. <a

<span class="sc">Problem of different Sounds of the same
String.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IT</span> had been observed at an
early period of acoustical knowledge, that one string might give
several sounds. Mersenne and others <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page37">37</a></span> had noticed<a id="fnanchor21-8"
href="#note21-8"><span class="fnanchor">21</span></a> that when a
string vibrates, one which is in unison with it vibrates without being
touched. He was also aware that this was true if the second string was
an octave or a twelfth below the first. This was observed as a new
fact in England in 1674, and communicated to the Royal Society by
Wallis.<a id="fnanchor22-8" href="#note22-8"><span
class="fnanchor">22</span></a> But the later observers ascertained
further, that the longer string divides itself into two, or into three
equal parts, separated by <i>nodes</i>, or points of rest; this they
proved by hanging bits of paper on different parts of the string. The
discovery so modified was again made by Sauveur<a id="fnanchor23-8"
href="#note23-8"><span class="fnanchor">23</span></a> about 1700. The
sounds thus produced in one string by the vibration of another, have
been termed <i>Sympathetic Sounds</i>. Similar sounds are often
produced by performers on stringed instruments, by touching the string
at one of its aliquot divisions, and are then called the <i>Acute
harmonics</i>. Such facts were not difficult to explain on Taylor’s
view of the mechanical condition of the string; but the difficulty was
increased when it was noticed that a sounding body could produce these
different notes <em>at the same time</em>. Mersenne had remarked this,
and the fact was more distinctly observed and pursued by Sauveur. The
notes thus produced in addition to the genuine note of the string,
have been called <i>Secondary Notes</i>; those usually heard are, the
Octave, the Twelfth, and the Seventeenth above the note itself. To
supply a mode of conceiving distinctly, and explaining mechanically,
vibrations which should allow of such an effect, was therefore a
requisite step in acoustics.</p>

<p>This task was performed by Daniel Bernoulli in a memoir published
in 1755.<a id="fnanchor24-8" href="#note24-8"><span
class="fnanchor">24</span></a> He there stated and proved the
Principle of <i>the coexistence of small vibrations</i>. It was
already established, that a string might vibrate either in a single
<i>swelling</i> (if we use this word to express the curve between two
nodes which Bernoulli calls a <i>ventre</i>), or in two or three or
any number of equal swellings with immoveable nodes between. Daniel
Bernoulli showed further, that these nodes might be combined, each
taking place as if it were the only one. This appears sufficient to
explain the coexistence of the harmonic sounds just noticed.
D’Alembert, indeed, in the article <i>Fundamental</i> in the French
<i>Encyclopédie</i>, and Lagrange in his <i>Dissertation on Sound</i>
in the <i>Turin Memoirs</i>,<a id="fnanchor25-8"
href="#note25-8"><span class="fnanchor">25</span></a> offer several
objections to this explanation; and it cannot be denied that the
subject has its difficulties; but <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page38">38</a></span> still these do not deprive Bernoulli of
the merit of having pointed out the principle of Coexistent
Vibrations, or divest that principle of its value in physical
science.</p>

<p>Daniel Bernoulli’s Memoir, of which we speak, was published at a
period when the clouds which involve the general analytical treatment
of the problem of vibrating strings, were thickening about Euler and
D’Alembert, and darkening into a controversial hue; and as Bernoulli
ventured to interpose his view, as a solution of these difficulties,
which, in a mathematical sense, it is not, we can hardly be surprised
that he met with a rebuff. The further prosecution of the different
modes of vibration of the same body need not be here considered.</p>
<p>The sounds which are called <i>Grave Harmonics</i>, have no analogy
with the Acute Harmonics above-mentioned; nor do they belong to this
section; for in the case of Grave Harmonics, we have one sound from
the co-operation of two strings, instead of several sounds from one
string. These harmonics are, in fact, connected with beats, of which
we have <a href="#v2page29">already</a> spoken; the beats becoming so
close as to produce a note of definite musical quality. The discovery
of the Grave Harmonics is usually ascribed to Tartini, who mentions
them in 1754; but they are first noticed<a id="fnanchor26-8"
href="#note26-8"><span class="fnanchor">26</span></a> in the work of
Sorge <i>On tuning Organs</i>, 1744. He there expresses this discovery
in a query. “Whence comes it, that if we tune a fifth (2 : 3), a
<em>third</em> sound is faintly heard, the octave below the lower of
the two notes? Nature shows that with 2 : 3, she still requires the
unity, to perfect the order 1, 2, 3.” The truth is, that these numbers
express the frequency of the vibrations, and thus there will be
coincidences of the notes 2 and 3, which are of the frequency 1, and
consequently give the octave below the sound 2. This is the
explanation given by Lagrange,<a id="fnanchor27-8"
href="#note27-8"><span class="fnanchor">27</span></a> and is indeed
obvious.</p>

<h3 id="b8-5">CHAPTER V.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Problem of the Sounds of Pipes.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IT</span> was taken for granted by
those who reasoned on sounds, that the sounds of flutes, organ-pipes,
and wind-instruments in general, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page39">39</a></span> consisted in vibrations of some kind; but
to determine the nature and laws of these vibrations, and to reconcile
them with mechanical principles, was far from easy. The leading facts
which had been noticed were, that the note of a pipe was proportional
to its length, and that a flute and similar instruments might be made
to produce some of the acute harmonics, as well as the genuine note.
It had further been noticed,<a id="fnanchor28-8"
href="#note28-8"><span class="fnanchor">28</span></a> that pipes
closed at the end, instead of giving the series of harmonics 1, ½, ⅓,
¼, &amp;c., would give only those notes which answer to the odd
numbers 1, ⅓, ⅕, &amp;c. In this problem also, Newton<a
id="fnanchor29-8" href="#note29-8"><span
class="fnanchor">29</span></a> made the first step to the solution. At
the end of the propositions respecting the velocity of sound, of which
we have <a href="#b8-3">spoken</a>, he noticed that it appeared by
taking Mersenne’s or Sauveur’s determination of the number of
vibrations corresponding to a given note, that the pulse of air runs
over twice the length of the pipe in the time of each vibration. He
does not follow out this observation, but it obviously points to the
theory, that the sound of a pipe consists of pulses which travel back
and forwards along its length, and are kept in motion by the breath of
the player. This supposition would account for the observed dependence
of the note on the length of the pipe. The subject does not appear to
have been again taken up in a theoretical way till about 1760; when
Lagrange in the second volume of the <i>Turin Memoirs</i>, and D.
Bernoulli in the <i>Memoirs of the French Academy</i> for 1762,
published important essays, in which some of the leading facts were
satisfactorily explained, and which may therefore be considered as the
principal solutions of the problem.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note28-8"

<p>In these solutions there was necessarily something hypothetical. In
the case of vibrating strings, as we have seen, the Form of the
vibrating curve was guessed at only, but the existence and position of
the Nodes could be rendered visible to the eye. In the vibrations of
air, we cannot see either the places of nodes, or the mode of
vibration; but several of the results are independent of these
circumstances. Thus both of the solutions explain the fact, that a
tube closed at one end is in unison with an open tube of double the
length; and, by supposing nodes to occur, they account for the
existence of the odd series of harmonics alone, 1, 3, 5, in closed
tubes, while the whole series, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c., occurs in open
ones. Both views of the nature of the vibration appear to be nearly
the same; though Lagrange’s is expressed with an analytical generality
which renders it obscure, and Bernoulli has perhaps <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page40">40</a></span> laid down an hypothesis
more special than was necessary. Lagrange<a id="fnanchor30-8"
href="#note30-8"><span class="fnanchor">30</span></a> considers the
vibration of open flutes as “the oscillations of a fibre of air,”
under the condition that its elasticity at the two ends is, during the
whole oscillation, the same as that of the surrounding atmosphere.
Bernoulli supposes<a id="fnanchor31-8" href="#note31-8"><span
class="fnanchor">31</span></a> the whole inertia of the air in the
flute to be collected into one particle, and this to be moved by the
whole elasticity arising from this displacement. It may be observed
that both these modes of treating the matter come very near to what we
have stated as Newton’s theory; for though Bernoulli supposes all the
air in the flute to be moved at once, and not successively, as by
Newton’s pulse, in either case the whole elasticity moves the whole
air in the tube, and requires more time to do this according to its
quantity. Since that time, the subject has received further
mathematical developement from Euler,<a id="fnanchor32-8"
href="#note32-8"><span class="fnanchor">32</span></a> Lambert,<a
id="fnanchor33-8" href="#note33-8"><span
class="fnanchor">33</span></a> and Poisson;<a id="fnanchor34-8"
href="#note34-8"><span class="fnanchor">34</span></a> but no new
explanation of facts has arisen. Attempts have however been made to
ascertain experimentally the places of the nodes. Bernoulli himself
had shown that this place was affected by the amount of the opening,
and Lambert<a id="fnanchor35-8" href="#note35-8"><span
class="fnanchor">35</span></a> had examined other cases with the same
view. Savart traced the node in various musical pipes under different
conditions; and very recently Mr. Hopkins, of Cambridge, has pursued
the same experimental inquiry.<a id="fnanchor36-8"
href="#note36-8"><span class="fnanchor">36</span></a> It appears from
these researches, that the early assumptions of mathematicians with
regard to the position of the nodes, are not exactly verified by the
facts. When the air in a pipe is made to vibrate so as to have several
nodes which divide it into equal parts, it had been supposed by
acoustical writers that the part adjacent to the open end was half of
the other parts; the outermost node, however, is found experimentally
to be <em>displaced</em> from the position thus assigned to it, by a
quantity depending on several collateral circumstances.</p>

<p>Since our purpose was to consider this problem only so far as it
has tended towards its mathematical solution, we have avoided saying
anything of the dependence of the mode of vibration on the cause by
which the sound is produced; and consequently, the researches on the
effects of reeds, embouchures, and the like, by Chladni, Savart,
Willis, and others, do not belong to our subject. It is easily seen
that the complex effect of the elasticity and other properties of the
reed and of the air together, is a problem of which we can hardly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page41">41</a></span> hope to give a
complete solution till our knowledge has advanced much beyond its
present condition.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the science of Acoustics there is a vast body of facts
to which we might apply what has just been said; but for the sake of
pointing out some of them, we shall consider them as the subjects of
one extensive and yet unsolved problem.</p>
<hr class="three space-above" />
<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Problem of Different Modes of Vibration of Bodies in
General.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">NOT</span> only the objects of which
we have spoken hitherto, strings and pipes, but almost all bodies are
capable of vibration. Bells, gongs, tuning-forks, are examples of
solid bodies; drums and tambourines, of membranes; if we run a wet
finger along the edge of a glass goblet, we throw the fluid which it
contains into a regular vibration; and the various character which
sounds possess according to the room in which they are uttered, shows
that large masses of air have peculiar modes of vibration. Vibrations
are generally accompanied by sound, and they may, therefore, be
considered as acoustical phenomena, especially as the sound is one of
the most decisive facts in indicating the mode of vibration. Moreover,
every body of this kind can vibrate in many different ways, the
vibrating segments being divided by Nodal Lines and Surfaces of
various form and number. The mode of vibration, selected by the body
in each case, is determined by the way in which it is held, the way in
which it is set in vibration, and the like circumstances.</p>
<p>The general problem of such vibrations includes the discovery and
classification of the phenomena; the detection of their formal laws;
and, finally, the explanation of these on mechanical principles. We
must speak very briefly of what has been done in these ways. The facts
which indicate Nodal Lines had been remarked by Galileo, on the
sounding board of a musical instrument; and Hooke had proposed to
observe the vibrations of a bell by strewing flour upon it. But it was
Chladni, a German philosopher, who enriched acoustics with the
discovery of the vast variety of symmetrical figures of Nodal Lines,
which are exhibited on plates of regular forms, when <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page42">42</a></span> made to sound. His
first investigations on this subject, <i>Entdeckungen über die Theorie
des Klangs</i>, were published 1787; and in 1802 and 1817 he added
other discoveries. In these works he not only related a vast number of
new and curious facts, but in some measure reduced some of them to
order and law. For instance, he has traced all the vibrations of
square plates to a resemblance with those forms of vibration in which
Nodal Lines are parallel to one side of the square, and those in which
they are parallel to another side; and he has established a notation
for the modes of vibration founded on this classification. Thus,
5&#8211;2 denotes a form in which there are five nodal lines parallel
to one side, and two to another; or a form which can be traced to a
disfigurement of such a standard type. Savart pursued this subject
still further; and traced, by actual observation, the forms of the
Nodal Surfaces which divide solid bodies, and masses of air, when in a
state of vibration.</p>
<p>The dependence of such vibrations upon their physical cause,
namely, the elasticity of the substance, we can conceive in a general
way; but the mathematical theory of such cases is, as might be
supposed, very difficult, even if we confine ourselves to the obvious
question of the mechanical possibility of these different modes of
vibration, and leave out of consideration their dependence upon the
mode of excitation. The transverse vibrations of elastic rods, plates,
and rings, had been considered by Euler in 1779; but his calculation
concerning plates had foretold only a small part of the curious
phenomena observed by Chladni;<a id="fnanchor37-8"
href="#note37-8"><span class="fnanchor">37</span></a> and the several
notes which, according to his calculation, the same ring ought to
give, were not in agreement with experiment.<a id="fnanchor38-8"
href="#note38-8"><span class="fnanchor">38</span></a> Indeed,
researches of this kind, as conducted by Euler, and other authors,<a
id="fnanchor39-8" href="#note39-8"><span
class="fnanchor">39</span></a> rather were, and were intended for,
examples of analytical skill, than explanations of physical facts.
James Bernoulli, after the publication of Chladni’s experiments in
1787, attempted to solve the problem for plates, by treating a plate
as a collection of fibres; but, as Chladni observes, the justice of
this mode of conception is disproved, by the disagreement of the
results with experiment.</p>

of the vibrations of elastic <span class="pagenum"><a

and this was not crowned, though honorable mention was made of it.<a
id="fnanchor41-8" href="#note41-8"><span
class="fnanchor">41</span></a> The formulæ of James Bernoulli were,
according to M. Poisson’s statement, defective, in consequence of his
not taking into account the normal force which acts at the exterior
boundary of the plate.<a id="fnanchor42-8" href="#note42-8"><span
class="fnanchor">42</span></a> The author of the anonymous memoir
corrected this error, and calculated the note corresponding to various
figures of the nodal lines; and he found an agreement with experiment
sufficient to justify his theory. He had not, however, proved his
fundamental equation, which M. Poisson demonstrated in a Memoir, read
in 1814.<a id="fnanchor43-8" href="#note43-8"><span
class="fnanchor">43</span></a> At a more recent period also, MM.
Poisson and Cauchy (as well as a lady, Mlle. Sophie Germain) have
applied to this problem the artifices of the most improved analysis.
M. Poisson<a id="fnanchor44-8" href="#note44-8"><span
class="fnanchor">44</span></a> determined the relation of the notes
given by the longitudinal and the transverse vibrations of a rod; and
solved the problem of vibrating circular plates when the nodal lines
are concentric circles. In both these cases, the numerical agreement
of his results with experience, seemed to confirm the justice of his
fundamental views.<a id="fnanchor45-8" href="#note45-8"><span
class="fnanchor">45</span></a> He proceeds upon the hypothesis, that
elastic bodies are composed of separate particles held together by the
attractive forces which they exert upon each other, and distended by
the repulsive force of heat. M. Cauchy<a id="fnanchor46-8"
href="#note46-8"><span class="fnanchor">46</span></a> has also
calculated the transverse, longitudinal, and rotatory vibrations of
elastic rods, and has obtained results agreeing closely with
experiment through a considerable list of comparisons. The combined
authority of two profound analysts, as MM. Poisson and Cauchy are,
leads us to believe that, for the simpler cases of the vibrations of
elastic bodies, Mathematics has executed her task; but most of the
more complex cases remain as yet unsubdued.</p>

<p>The two brothers, Ernest and William Weber, made many curious
observations on undulations, which are contained in their
<i>Wellenlehre</i>, (Doctrine of Waves,) published at Leipsig in 1825.
They were led to suppose, (as Young had suggested at an earlier
period,) that Chladni’s figures of nodal lines in plates were to be
accounted for by the superposition of undulations.<a id="fnanchor47-8"

class="pagenum"><a id="v2page44">44</a></span> superposition of two or
more simple and obviously allowable modes of nodal division, which
have the same time of vibration. He assumes, for this purpose, certain
“primary figures,” containing only <em>parallel</em> nodal lines; and
by combining these, first in twos, and then in fours, he obtains most
of Chladni’s observed figures, and accounts for their transitions and
deviations from regularity.</p>

<p>The principle of the superposition of vibrations is so solidly
established as a mechanical truth, that we may consider an acoustical
problem as satisfactorily disposed of when it is reduced to that
principle, as well as when it is solved by analytical mechanics: but
at the same time we may recollect, that the right application and
limitation of this law involves no small difficulty; and in this case,
as in all advances in physical science, we cannot but wish to have the
new ground which has been gained, gone over by some other person in
some other manner; and thus secured to us as a permanent
possession.</p>
<p><i>Savart’s Laws.</i>&#8212;In what has preceded, the vibrations of
bodies have been referred to certain general classes, the separation
of which was suggested by observation; for example, the
<i>transverse</i>, <i>longitudinal</i>, and <i>rotatory</i>,<a
id="fnanchor49-8" href="#note49-8"><span
class="fnanchor">49</span></a> vibrations of rods. The transverse
vibrations, in which the rod goes backwards and forwards across the
line of its length, were the only ones noticed by the earlier
acousticians: the others were principally brought into notice by
Chladni. As we have already seen in the preceding pages, this
classification serves to express important laws; as, for instance, a
law obtained by M. Poisson which gives the relation of the notes
produced by the transverse and longitudinal vibrations of a rod. But
this distinction was employed by M. Felix Savart to express laws of a
more general kind; and then, as often happens in the progress of
science, by pursuing these laws to a higher point of generality, the
distinction again seemed to vanish. A very few words will explain
these steps.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note49-8"
href="#fnanchor49-8">49</a></span> Vibrations tournantes.</div>
<p>It was long ago known that vibrations may be communicated by
contact. The distinction of transverse and longitudinal vibrations
being established, Savart found that if one rod touched another
perpendicularly, the longitudinal vibrations of the first occasion
transverse vibrations in the second, and <i>vice versâ</i>. This is
the more remarkable, since the two sets of vibrations are not equal in
rapidity, and therefore cannot sympathize in any obvious manner.<a
id="fnanchor50-8" href="#note50-8"><span
class="fnanchor">50</span></a> Savart found himself <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page45">45</a></span> able to generalize this
proposition, and to assert that in any combination of rods, strings,
and laminæ, at right angles to each other, the longitudinal and
transverse vibrations affect respectively the rods in the one and
other direction,<a id="fnanchor51-8" href="#note51-8"><span
class="fnanchor">51</span></a> so that when the horizontal rods, for
example, vibrate in the one way, the vertical rods vibrate in the
other.</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note51-8"
href="#fnanchor51-8">51</a></span> <i>An. Chim.</i> p. 152.</div>
<p>This law was thus expressed in terms of that classification of
vibrations of which we have spoken. Yet we easily see that we may
express it in a more general manner, without referring to that
classification, by saying, that vibrations are communicated so as
always to be parallel to their original direction. And by following it
out in this shape by means of experiment, M. Savart was led, a short
time afterwards, to deny that there is any essential distinction in
these different kinds of vibration. “We are thus led,” he says<a
id="fnanchor52-8" href="#note52-8"><span
class="fnanchor">52</span></a> in 1822, “to consider <i>normal</i>
[transverse] vibrations as only one circumstance in a more general
motion common to all bodies, analogous to <i>tangential</i>
[longitudinal and rotatory] vibrations; that is, as produced by small
<i>molecular oscillations</i>, and differently modified according to
the direction which it affects, relatively to the dimensions of the
vibrating body.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note52-8"
href="#fnanchor52-8">52</a></span> Ib. t. xxv. p. 33.</div>
<p>These “inductions,” as he properly calls them, are supported by a
great mass of ingenious experiments; and may be considered as well
established, when they are limited to molecular oscillations,
employing this phrase in the sense in which it is understood in the
above statement; and also when they are confined to bodies in which
the play of elasticity is not interrupted by parts more rigid than the
rest, as the sound-post of a violin.<a id="fnanchor53-8"
href="#note53-8"><span class="fnanchor">53</span></a> And before I
quit the subject, I may notice a consequence which M. Savart has
deduced from his views, and which, at first sight, appears to overturn
most of the earlier doctrines respecting vibrating bodies. It was
formerly held that tense strings and elastic rods could vibrate only
in a determinate series of modes of division, with no intermediate
steps. But M. Savart maintains,<a id="fnanchor54-8"
href="#note54-8"><span class="fnanchor">54</span></a> on the contrary,
that they produce sounds which are gradually transformed into one
another, by indefinite intermediate degrees. The reader may naturally
ask, what is the solution of this apparent <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page46">46</a></span> contradiction between the earliest and the
latest discoveries in acoustics. And the answer must be, that these
intermediate modes of vibration are complex in their nature, and
difficult to produce; and that those which were formerly believed to
be the only possible vibrating conditions, are so eminent above all
the rest by their features, their simplicity, and their facility, that
we may still, for common purposes, consider them as a class apart;
although for the sake of reaching a general theorem, we may associate
them with the general mass of cases of molecular vibrations. And thus
we have no exception here, as we can have none in any case, to our
maxim, that what formed part of the early discoveries of science,
forms part of its latest systems.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note53-8"
href="#fnanchor53-8">53</a></span> For the suggestion of the necessity
of this limitation I am indebted to Mr. Willis.</div>

<p>We have thus surveyed the progress of the science of sound up to
recent times, with respect both to the discovery of laws of phenomena,
and the reduction of these to their mechanical causes. The former
branch of the science has necessarily been inductively pursued; and
therefore has been more peculiarly the subject of our attention. And
this consideration will explain why we have not dwelt more upon the
deductive labors of the great analysts who have treated of this
problem.</p>
<p>To those who are acquainted with the high and deserved fame which
the labors of D’Alembert, Euler, Lagrange, and others, upon this
subject, enjoy among mathematicians, it may seem as if we had not
given them their due prominence in our sketch. But it is to be
recollected here, as we have already observed in the case of
hydrodynamics, that even when the general principles are uncontested,
mere mathematical deductions from them do not belong to the history of
physical science, except when they point out laws which are
intermediate between the general principle and the individual facts,
and which observation may confirm.</p>
<p>The business of constructing any science may be figured as the task
of forming a road on which our reason can travel through a certain
province of the external world. We have to throw a bridge which may
lead from the chambers of our own thoughts, from our speculative
principles, to the distant shore of material facts. But in all cases
the abyss is too wide to be crossed, except we can find some
intermediate points on which the piers of our structure may rest. Mere
facts, without connexion or law, are only the rude stones hewn from
the opposite bank, of which our arches may, at some time, be built.
But mere hypothetical mathematical calculations are only plans of
projected structures; and those plans which exhibit only one vast
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page47">47</a></span> and single arch,
or which suppose no support but that which our own position supplies,
will assuredly never become realities. We must have a firm basis of
intermediate generalizations in order to frame a continuous and stable
edifice.</p>
<p>In the subject before us, we have no want of such points of
intermediate support, although they are in many instances irregularly
distributed and obscurely seen. The number of observed laws and
relations of the phenomena of sound, is already very great; and though
the time may be distant, there seems to be no reason to despair of one
day uniting them by clear ideas of mechanical causation, and thus of
making acoustics a perfect secondary mechanical science.</p>
<p>The historical sketch just given includes only such parts of
acoustics as have been in some degree reduced to general laws and
physical causes; and thus excludes much that is usually treated of
under that head. Moreover, many of the numerical calculations
connected with sound belong to its agreeable effect upon the ear; as
the properties of the various systems of <i>Temperament</i>. These are
parts of Theoretical Music, not of Acoustics; of the Philosophy of the
Fine Arts, not of Physical Science; and may be referred to in a future
portion of this work, so far as they bear upon our object.</p>
<p>The science of Acoustics may, however, properly consider other
differences of sound than those of acute and grave,&#8212;for
instance, the <i>articulate</i> differences, or those by which the
various letters are formed. Some progress has been made in reducing
this part of the subject to general rules; for though Kempelen’s
“talking machine” was only a work of art, Mr. Willis’s machine,<a
id="fnanchor55-8" href="#note55-8"><span
class="fnanchor">55</span></a> which exhibits the relation among the
vowels, gives us a law such as forms a step in science. We may,
however, consider this instrument as a <i>phthongometer</i>, or
measure of vowel quality; and in that point of view we shall have to
refer to it again when we come to speak of such measures.</p>

<h3 class="space-above">INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<h4 class="five"><i>Formal and Physical Optics.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> history of the science of
Optics, written at length, would be  very voluminous; but we shall not
need to make our history so; since our main object is to illustrate
the nature of science and the conditions of its progress. In this way
Optics is peculiarly instructive; the more so, as its history has
followed a course in some respects different from both the sciences
previously reviewed. Astronomy, as we have seen, advanced with a
steady and continuous movement from one generation to another, from
the earliest time, till her career was crowned by the great unforeseen
discovery of Newton; Acoustics had her extreme generalization in view
from the first, and her history consists in the correct application of
it to successive problems; Optics advanced through a scale of
generalizations as remarkable as those of Astronomy; but for a long
period she was almost stationary; and, at last, was rapidly impelled
through all those stages by the energy of two or three discoverers.
The highest point of generality which Optics has reached is little
different from that which Acoustics occupied at once; but in the older
and earlier science we still want that palpable and pointed
confirmation of the general principle, which the undulatory theory
receives from optical phenomena. Astronomy has amassed her vast
fortune by long-continued industry and labor; Optics has obtained hers
in a few years by sagacious and happy speculations; Acoustics, having
early acquired a competence, has since been employed rather in
improving and adorning than in extending her estate.</p>
<p>The successive inductions by which Optics made her advances, might,
of course, be treated in the same manner as those of Astronomy, each
having its prelude and its sequel. But most of the discoveries in
Optics are of a smaller character, and have less employed the minds of
men, than those of Astronomy; and it will not be necessary to exhibit
them in this detailed manner, till we come to the great generalization
by which the theory was established. I shall, therefore, now pass
rapidly in review the earlier optical discoveries, without any such
division of the series. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page52">52</a></span></p>
<p>Optics, like Astronomy, has for its object of inquiry, first, the
laws of phenomena, and next, their causes; and we may hence divide
this science, like the other, into <i>Formal Optics</i> and
<i>Physical Optics</i>. The distinction is clear and substantive, but
it is not easy to adhere to it in our narrative; for, after the theory
had begun to make its rapid advance, many of the laws of phenomena
were studied and discovered in immediate reference to the theoretical
cause, and do not occupy a separate place in the history of science,
as in Astronomy they do. We may add, that the reason why Formal
Astronomy was almost complete before Physical Astronomy began to
exist, was, that it was necessary to construct the science of
Mechanics in the mean time, in order to be able to go on; whereas, in
Optics, mathematicians were able to calculate the results of the
undulatory theory as soon as it had suggested itself from the earlier
facts, and while the great mass of facts were only becoming known.</p>
<p>We shall, then, in the first <i>nine</i> chapters of the History of
Optics treat of the Formal Science, that is, the discovery of the laws
of phenomena. The classes of phenomena which will thus pass under oar
notice are numerous; namely, reflection, refraction, chromatic
dispersion, achromatization, double refraction, polarization,
dipolarization, the colors of thin plates, the colors of thick plates,
and the fringes and bands which accompany shadows. All these cases had
been studied, and, in most of them, the laws had been in a great
measure discovered, before the physical theory of the subject gave to
our knowledge a simpler and more solid form.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Primary Induction of Optics.&#8212;Rays of Light and
Laws of Reflection.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IN</span> speaking of the Ancient
History of Physics, we have <a href="#v1page100">already</a> noticed
that the optical philosophers of antiquity had satisfied themselves
that vision is performed in straight lines;&#8212;that they had fixed
their attention upon those straight lines, or <i>rays</i>, as the
proper object of the science;&#8212;they had ascertained that rays
reflected from a bright surface make the <i>angle of reflection</i>
equal to the <i>angle of incidence</i>;&#8212;and they had drawn
several consequences from these principles.</p>
<p>We may add to the consequences already mentioned, the art of
<i>perspective</i>, which is merely a corollary from the doctrine of
rectilinear visual rays; for if we suppose objects to be referred by
such rays to a plane interposed between them and the eye, all the
rules of perspective follow directly. The ancients practised this art,
as we see in the pictures which remain to us and we learn from
Vitruvius,<a id="fnanchor1-9" href="#note1-9"><span
class="fnanchor">1</span></a> that they also wrote upon it.
Agatharchus, who had been instructed by Eschylus in the art of making
decorations for the theatre, was the first author on this subject, and
Anaxagoras, who was a pupil of Agatharchus, also wrote an
<i>Actinographia</i>, or doctrine of drawing by rays: but none of
these treatises are come down to us. The moderns re-invented the art
in the flourishing times of the art of painting, that is, about the
end of the fifteenth century; and, belonging to that period also, we
have treatises<a id="fnanchor2-9" href="#note2-9"><span
class="fnanchor">2</span></a> upon it.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-9"

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note2-9"

<p>But these are only deductive applications of the most elementary
optical doctrines; we must proceed to the inductions by which further
discoveries were made. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page54">54</a></span></p>
<h3 class="space-above" id="b9-2">CHAPTER II.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Discovery of the Law of Refraction.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">WE</span> have seen in the former <a
href="#v1page100">part</a> of this history that the Greeks had formed
a tolerably clear conception of the refraction as well as the
reflection of the rays of light; and that Ptolemy had measured the
amount of refraction of glass and water at various angles. If we give
the names of the <i>angle of incidence</i> and the <i>angle of
refraction</i> respectively to the angles which a ray of light makes
with the line perpendicular to surface of glass or water (or any other
medium) within and without the medium, Ptolemy had observed that the
angle of refraction is always less than the angle of incidence. He had
supposed it to be less in a given proportion, but this opinion is
false; and was afterwards rightly denied by the Arabian mathematician
Alhazen. The optical views which occur in the work of Alhazen are far
sounder than those of his predecessors; and the book may be regarded
as the most considerable monument which we have of the scientific
genius of the Arabians; for it appears, for the most part, not to be
borrowed from Greek authorities. The author not only asserts (lib.
vii.), that refraction takes place towards the perpendicular, and
refers to experiment for the truth of this: and that the quantities of
the refraction differ according to the magnitudes of the angles which
the directions of the incidental rays (<i>primæ lineæ</i>) make with
the perpendiculars to the surface; but he also says distinctly and
decidedly that the angles of refraction do not follow the proportion
of the angles of incidence.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [There appears to be good ground to assent to the
assertion of Alhazen’s originality, made by his editor Risner, who
says, “Euclideum hic vel Ptolemaicum nihil fere est.” Besides the
doctrine of reflection and refraction of light, the Arabian author
gives a description of the eye. He distinguishes three fluids,
<i>humor aqueus</i>, <i>crystallinus</i>, <i>vitreus</i>, and four
coats of the eye, <i>tunica adherens</i>, <i>cornea</i>, <i>uvea</i>,
<i>tunica reti similis</i>. He distinguishes also three kinds of
vision: “Visibile percipitur aut solo visu, aut visu et syllogismo,
aut visu et anticipatâ notione.” He has several propositions relating
to what we sometimes call the Philosophy of Vision: for instance this:
“E visibili sæpius viso remanet in anima generalis notio,” &amp;c.]
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page55">55</a></span></p>
<p>The assertion, that the angles of refraction are not proportional
to the angles of incidence, was an important remark; and if it had
been steadily kept in mind, the next thing to be done with regard to
refraction was to go on experimenting and conjecturing till the true
law of refraction was discovered; and in the mean time to apply the
principle as far as it was known. Alhazen, though he gives directions
for making experimental measures of refraction, does not give any
Table of the results of such experiments, as Ptolemy had done.
Vitello, a Pole, who in the 13th century published an extensive work
upon Optics, does give such a table; and asserts it to be deduced from
experiment, as I have already said (<a href="#v1page104">vol. i.</a>).
But this assertion is still liable to doubt in consequence of the
table containing impossible observations.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [As I have already stated, Vitello asserts that his
Tables were derived from his own observations. Their near agreement
with those of Ptolemy does not make this improbable: for where the
observations were only made to half a degree, there was not much room
for observers to differ. It is not unlikely that the observations of
refraction out of air into water and glass, and out of water into
glass, were actually made; while the impossible values which accompany
them, of the refraction out of water and glass into air, and out of
glass into water, were calculated, and calculated from an erroneous
rule.]</p>
<p>The principle that a ray refracted in glass or water is turned
towards the perpendicular, without knowing the exact law of
refraction, enabled mathematicians to trace the effects of transparent
bodies in various cases. Thus in Roger Bacon’s works we find a
tolerably distinct explanation of the effect of a convex glass; and in
the work of Vitello the effect of refraction at the two surfaces of a
glass globe is clearly traceable.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Alhazen’s assertion of the contrary, the opinion
was still current among mathematicians that the angle of refraction
was proportional to the angle of incidence. But when Kepler’s
attention was drawn to the subject, he saw that this was plainly
inconsistent with the observations of Vitello for large angles; and he
convinced himself by his own experiments that the true law was
something different from the one commonly supposed. The discovery of
this true law excited in him an eager curiosity; and this point had
the more interest for him in consequence of the introduction of a
correction for atmospheric refraction into astronomical calculations,
which had been made by Tycho, and of the invention of the telescope.
In <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page56">56</a></span> his
<i>Supplement to Vitello</i>, published in 1604, Kepler attempts to
reduce to a rule the measured quantities of refraction. The reader who
recollects what we have already narrated, the manner in which Kepler
attempted to reduce to law the astronomical observations of
Tycho,&#8212;devising an almost endless variety of possible formulæ,
tracing their consequences with undaunted industry, and relating, with
a vivacious garrulity, his disappointments and his hopes,&#8212;will
not be surprised to find that he proceeded in the same manner with
regard to the Tables of Observed Refractions. He tried a variety of
constructions by triangles, conic sections, &amp;c., without being
able to satisfy himself; and he at last<a id="fnanchor3-9"
href="#note3-9"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a> is obliged to
content himself with an approximate rule, which makes the refraction
partly proportional to the angle of incidence, and partly, to the
secant of that angle. In this way he satisfies the observed
refractions within a difference of less than half a degree each way.
When we consider how simple the law of refraction is, (that the ratio
of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction is constant for
the same medium,) it appears strange that a person attempting to
discover it, and drawing triangles for the purpose, should fail; but
this lot of missing what afterwards seems to have been obvious, is a
common one in the pursuit of truth.</p>

<p>The person who did discover the Law of the Sines, was Willebrord
Snell, about 1621; but the law was first published by Descartes, who
had seen Snell’s papers.<a id="fnanchor4-9" href="#note4-9"><span
class="fnanchor">4</span></a> Descartes does not acknowledge this law
to have been first detected by another; and after his manner, instead
of establishing its reality by reference to experiment, he pretends to
prove <i>à priori</i> that it must be true,<a id="fnanchor5-9"
href="#note5-9"><span class="fnanchor">5</span></a> comparing, for
this purpose, the particles of light to balls striking a substance
which <i>accelerates</i> them.</p>

<p>[2nd Ed.] [Huyghens says of Snell’s papers, “Quæ et nos vidimus
aliquando, et Cartesium quoque vidisse accepimus, et hinc fortasse
mensuram illam quæ in sinibus consistit elicuerit.” Isaac Vossius,
<i>De Lucis Naturâ et Proprietate</i>, says that he also had seen this
law in Snell’s unpublished optical Treatise. The same writer says,
“Quod itaque (Cartesius) habet, refractionum momenta non exigenda esse
ad angulos sed ad lineas, id tuo Snellio, acceptum ferre debuisset,
cujus nomen <em>more solito</em> dissimulavit.” “Cartesius got his law
from Snell, and <em>in his usual way</em>, concealed it.” <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page57">57</a></span></p>
<p>Huyghens’ assertion, that Snell did not <em>attend to</em> the
proportion of the sines, is very captious; and becomes absurdly so,
when it is made to mean that Snell did not <em>know</em> the law of
the sines. It is not denied that Snell knew the true law, or that the
true law is the law of the sines. Snell does not use the
trigonometrical term <i>sine</i>, but he expresses the law in a
geometrical form more simply. Even if he <em>had</em> attended to the
law of the sines, he might reasonably have preferred his own way of
stating it.</p>
<p>James Gregory also independently discovered the true law of
refraction; and, in publishing it, states that he had learnt that it
had already been published by Descartes.]</p>
<p>But though Descartes does not, in this instance, produce any good
claims to the character of an inductive philosopher, he showed
considerable skill in tracing the consequences of the principle when
once adopted. In particular we must consider him as the genuine author
of the explanation of the rainbow. It is true that Fleischer<a
id="fnanchor6-9" href="#note6-9"><span class="fnanchor">6</span></a>
and Kepler had previously ascribed this phenomenon to the rays of
sunlight which, falling on drops of rain, are refracted into each
drop, reflected at its inner surface, and refracted out again: Antonio
de Dominis had found that a glass globe of water, when placed in a
particular position with respect to the eye, exhibited bright colors;
and had hence explained the circular form of the bow, which, indeed,
Aristotle had done before.<a id="fnanchor7-9" href="#note7-9"><span
class="fnanchor">7</span></a> But none of these writers had shown why
there was a narrow bright circle of a definite diameter; for the drops
which send rays to the eye after two refractions and a reflection,
occupy a much wider space in the heavens. Descartes assigned the
reason for this in the most satisfactory manner,<a id="fnanchor8-9"
href="#note8-9"><span class="fnanchor">8</span></a> by showing that
the rays which, after two refractions and a reflection, come to the
eye at an angle of about forty-one degrees with their original
direction, are far more dense than those in any other position. He
showed, in the same manner, that the existence and position of the
<i>secondary bow</i> resulted from the same laws. This is the complete
and adequate account of the state of things, so far as the brightness
of the bows only is concerned; the explanation of the colors belongs
to the next article of our survey.</p>

<p>The explanation of the rainbow and of its magnitude, afforded by
Snell’s law of sines, was perhaps one of the leading points in the
verification of the law. The principle, being once established, was
applied, by the aid of mathematical reasoning, to atmospheric
refractions, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page58">58</a></span>
optical instruments, <i>diacaustic</i> curves, (that is, the curves of
intense light produced by refraction,) and to various other cases; and
was, of course, tested and confirmed by such applications. It was,
however, impossible to pursue these applications far, without a due
knowledge of the laws by which, in such cases, colors are produced. To
these we now proceed.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [I have omitted many interesting parts of the history of
Optics about this period, because I was concerned with the
<em>inductive</em> discovery of laws, rather than with mathematical
<em>deductions</em> from such laws when established, or
<em>applications</em> of them in the form of instruments. I might
otherwise have noticed the discovery of Spectacle Glasses, of the
Telescope, of the Microscope, of the Camera Obscura, and the
mathematical explanation of these and other phenomena, as given by
Kepler and others. I might also have noticed the progress of knowledge
respecting the Eye and Vision. We have <a href="#v2page54">seen</a>
that Alhazen described the structure of the eye. The operation of the
parts was gradually made out. Baptista Porta compares the eye to his
<i>Camera Obscura</i> (<i>Magia Naturalis</i>, 1579). Scheiner, in his
<i>Oculus</i>, published 1652, completed the Theory of the Eye. And
Kepler discussed some of the questions even now often agitated; as the
causes and conditions of our seeing objects single with two eyes, and
erect with inverted images.]</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Discovery of the Law of Dispersion by
Refraction.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">EARLY</span> attempts were made to
account for the colors of the rainbow, and various other phenomena in
which colors are seen to arise from transient and unsubstantial
combinations of media. Thus Aristotle explains the colors of the
rainbow by supposing<a id="fnanchor9-9" href="#note9-9"><span
class="fnanchor">9</span></a> that it is light seen through a dark
medium: “Now,” says he, “the bright seen through the dark appears red,
as, for instance, the fire of green wood seen through the smoke, and
the sun through mist. Also<a id="fnanchor10-9" href="#note10-9"><span
class="fnanchor">10</span></a> the weaker is the light, or the visual
power, and the nearer the color approaches to the black; becoming
first red, then green, then purple. But<a id="fnanchor11-9"
href="#note11-9"><span class="fnanchor">11</span></a> the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page59">59</a></span> vision is strongest in
the outer circle, because the periphery is greater;&#8212;thus we
shall have a gradation from red, through green, to purple, in passing
from the outer to the inner circle.” This account would hardly have
deserved much notice, if it had not been for a strange attempt to
revive it, or something very like it, in modern times. The same
doctrine is found in the work of De Dominis.<a id="fnanchor12-9"
href="#note12-9"><span class="fnanchor">12</span></a> According to
him, light is white: but if we mix with the light something dark, the
colors arise,&#8212;first red, then green, then blue or violet. He
applies this to explain the colors of the rainbow,<a id="fnanchor13-9"
href="#note13-9"><span class="fnanchor">13</span></a> by means of the
consideration that, of the rays which come to the eye from the globes
of water, some go through a larger thickness of the globe than others,
whence he obtains the gradation of colors just described.</p>

<p>Descartes came far nearer the true philosophy of the iridal colors.
He found that a similar series of colors was produced by refraction of
light bounded by shade, through a prism;<a id="fnanchor14-9"
href="#note14-9"><span class="fnanchor">14</span></a> and he rightly
inferred that neither the curvature of the surface of the drops of
water, nor the reflection, nor the repetition of refraction, were
necessary to the generation of such colors. In further examining the
course of the rays, he approaches very near to the true conception of
the case; and we are led to believe that he might have anticipated
Newton in his discovery of the unequal refrangibility of different
colors, if it had been possible for him to reason any otherwise than
in the terms and notions of his preconceived hypotheses. The
conclusion which he draws is,<a id="fnanchor15-9"
href="#note15-9"><span class="fnanchor">15</span></a> that “the
particles of the subtile matter which transmit the action of light,
endeavor to rotate with so great a force and impetus, that they cannot
move in a straight line (whence comes refraction): and that those
particles which endeavor to revolve much more strongly produce a red
color, those which endeavor to move only a little more strongly
produce yellow.” Here we have a clear perception that colors and
unequal refraction are connected, though the cause of refraction is
expressed by a gratuitous hypothesis. And we may add, that he applies
this notion rightly, so far as he explains himself,<a
id="fnanchor16-9" href="#note16-9"><span
class="fnanchor">16</span></a> to account for the colors of the
rainbow.</p>

<p>It appears to me that Newton and others have done Descartes
injustice, in ascribing to De Dominis the true theory of the rainbow.
There are two main points of this theory, namely, the showing that a
<em>bright</em> circular band, of a certain definite diameter, arises
from the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page60">60</a></span> great
intensity of the light returned at a certain angle; and the referring
the different <em>colors</em> to the <em>different quantity of the
refraction</em>; and both these steps appear indubitably to be the
discoveries of Descartes. And he informs us that these discoveries
were not made without some exertion of thought. “At first,” he says,<a
id="fnanchor17-9" href="#note17-9"><span
class="fnanchor">17</span></a> “I doubted whether the iridal colors
were produced in the same way as those in the prism; but, at last,
taking my pen, and carefully calculating the course of the rays which
fell on each part of the drop, I found that many more come at an angle
of forty-one degrees, than either at a greater or a less angle. So
that there is a bright bow terminated by a shade; and hence the colors
are the same as those produced through a prism.”</p>

href="#fnanchor17-9">17</a></span> Sect. ix. p. 193.</div>
<p>The subject was left nearly in the same state, in the work of
Grimaldi, <i>Physico-Mathesis, de Lumine, Coloribus et Iride</i>,
published at Bologna in 1665. There is in this work a constant
reference to numerous experiments, and a systematic exposition of the
science in an improved state. The author’s calculations concerning the
rainbow are put in the same form as those of Descartes; but he is
further from seizing the true principle on which its coloration
depends. He rightly groups together a number of experiments in which
colors arise from refraction;<a id="fnanchor18-9"
href="#note18-9"><span class="fnanchor">18</span></a> and explains
them by saying that the color is brighter where the light is denser:
and the light is denser on the side from which the refraction turns
the ray, because the increments of refraction are greater in the rays
that are more inclined.<a id="fnanchor19-9" href="#note19-9"><span
class="fnanchor">19</span></a> This way of treating the question might
be made to give a sort of explanation of most of the facts, but is
much more erroneous than a developement of Descartes’s view would have
been.</p>

<p>At length, in 1672, Newton gave<a id="fnanchor20-9"
href="#note20-9"><span class="fnanchor">20</span></a> the true
explanation of the facts; namely, that light consists of rays of
different colors and different refrangibility. This now appears to us
so obvious a mode of interpreting the phenomena, that we can hardly
understand how they can be conceived in any other manner; but yet the
impression which this discovery made, both upon Newton and upon his
contemporaries, shows how remote it was from the then accepted
opinions. There appears to have been a general persuasion that the
coloration was produced, not by any peculiarity in the law of
refraction itself but by some collateral circumstance,&#8212;some
dispersion or variation of density of the light, in addition to the
refraction. Newton’s discovery consisted in <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page61">61</a></span> teaching distinctly that the law of
refraction was to be applied, not to the beam of light in general, but
to the colors in particular.</p>

<p>When Newton produced a bright spot on the wall of his chamber, by
admitting the sun’s light through a small hole in his window-shutter,
and making it pass through a prism, he expected the image to be round;
which, of course, it would have been, if the colors had been produced
by an equal dispersion in all directions; but to his surprise he saw
the image, or <i>spectrum</i>, five times as long as it was broad. He
found that no consideration of the different thickness of the glass,
the possible unevenness of its surface, or the different angles of
rays proceeding from the two sides of the sun, could be the cause of
this shape. He found, also, that the rays did not go from the prism to
the image in curves; he was then convinced that the different colors
were refracted separately, and at different angles; and he confirmed
this opinion by transmitting and refracting the rays of each color
separately.</p>
<p>The experiments are so easy and common, and Newton’s interpretation
of them so simple and evident, that we might have expected it to
receive general assent; indeed, as we have shown, Descartes had
already been led very near the same point. In fact, Newton’s opinions
were not long in obtaining general acceptance; but they met with
enough of cavil and misapprehension to annoy extremely the discoverer,
whose clear views and quiet temper made him impatient alike of
stupidity and of contentiousness.</p>
<p>We need not dwell long on the early objections which were made to
Newton’s doctrine. A Jesuit, of the name of Ignatius Pardies,
professor at Clermont, at first attempted to account for the
elongation of the image by the difference of the angles made by the
rays from the two edges of the sun, which would produce a difference
in the amount of refraction of the two borders; but when Newton
pointed out the calculations which showed the insufficiency of this
explanation, he withdrew his opposition. Another more pertinacious
opponent appeared in Francis Linus, a physician of Liege; who
maintained, that having tried the experiment, he found the sun’s
image, when the sky was clear, to be round and not oblong; and he
ascribed the elongation noticed by Newton, to the effect of clouds.
Newton for some time refused to reply to this contradiction of his
assertions, though obstinately persisted in; and his answer was at
last sent, just about the time of Linus’s death, in 1675. But
Gascoigne, a friend of Linus, still maintained that he and others had
seen what the Dutch physician had described; and Newton, who was
pleased with the candor of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page62">62</a></span> Gascoigne’s letter, suggested that the
Dutch experimenters might have taken one of the images reflected from
the surfaces of the prism, of which there are several, instead of the
proper refracted one. By the aid of this hint, Lucas of Liege repeated
Newton’s experiments, and obtained Newton’s result, except that he
never could obtain a spectrum whose length was more than three and a
half times its breadth. Newton, on his side, persisted in asserting
that the image would be five times as long as it was broad, if the
experiment were properly made. It is curious that he should have been
so confident of this, as to conceive himself certain that such would
be the result in all cases. We now know that the dispersion, and
consequently the length, of the spectrum, is very different for
different kinds of glass, and it is very probable that the Dutch prism
was really less dispersive than the English one.<a id="fnanchor21-9"
href="#note21-9"><span class="fnanchor">21</span></a> The erroneous
assumption which Newton made in this instance, he held by to the last;
and was thus prevented from making the discovery of which we have next
to speak.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note21-9"
href="#fnanchor21-9">21</a></span> Brewster’s <i>Newton</i>, p.
50.</div>
<p>Newton was attacked by persons of more importance than those we
have yet mentioned; namely, Hooke and Huyghens. These philosophers,
however, did not object so much to the laws of refraction of different
colors, as to some expressions used by Newton, which, they conceived,
conveyed false notions respecting the composition and nature of light.
Newton had asserted that all the different colors are of distinct
kinds, and that, by their composition, they form white light. This is
true of colors as far as their analysis and composition by refraction
are concerned; but Hooke maintained that all natural colors are
produced by various combinations of two primary ones, red and
violet;<a id="fnanchor22-9" href="#note22-9"><span
class="fnanchor">22</span></a> and Huyghens held a similar doctrine,
taking, however, yellow and blue for his basis. Newton answers, that
such compositions as they speak of are not compositions of simple
colors in his sense of the expressions. These writers also had both of
them adopted an opinion that light consisted in vibrations; and
objected to Newton that his language was erroneous, as involving the
hypothesis that light was a body. Newton appears to have had a horror
of the word <i>hypothesis</i>, and protests against its being supposed
that his “theory” rests on such a foundation.</p>

href="#fnanchor22-9">22</a></span> Brewster’s <i>Newton</i>, p. 54.
<i>Phil. Trans.</i> viii. 5084, 6086.</div>
<p>The doctrine of the unequal refrangibility of different rays is
clearly exemplified in the effects of lenses, which produce images
more or <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page63">63</a></span> less
bordered with color, in consequence of this property. The improvement
of telescopes was, in Newton’s time, the great practical motive for
aiming at the improvement of theoretical optics. Newton’s theory
showed why telescopes were imperfect, namely, in consequence of the
different refraction of different colors, which produces a
<i>chromatic</i> aberration: and the theory was confirmed by the
circumstances of such imperfections. The false opinion of which we
have already spoken, that the dispersion must be the same when the
refraction is the same, led him to believe that the imperfection was
insurmountable,&#8212;that <i>achromatic</i> refraction could not be
obtained: and this view made him turn his attention to the
construction of reflecting instead of refracting telescopes. But the
rectification of Newton’s error was a further confirmation of the
general truth of his principles in other respects; and since that
time, the soundness of the Newtonian law of refraction has hardly been
questioned among physical philosophers.</p>
<p>It has, however, in modern times, been very vehemently controverted
in a quarter from which we might not readily have expected a detailed
discussion on such a subject. The celebrated Göthe has written a work
on <i>The Doctrine of Colors</i>, (<i>Farbenlehre</i>; Tübingen,
1810,) one main purpose of which is, to represent Newton’s opinions,
and the work in which they are formally published, (his
<i>Opticks</i>,) as utterly false and mistaken, and capable of being
assented to only by the most blind and obstinate prejudice. Those who
are acquainted with the extent to which such an opinion, promulgated
by Göthe, was likely to be widely adopted in Germany, will not be
surprised that similar language is used by other writers of that
nation. Thus Schelling<a id="fnanchor23-9" href="#note23-9"><span
class="fnanchor">23</span></a> says: “Newton’s <i>Opticks</i> is the
greatest proof of the possibility of a whole structure of fallacies,
which, in all its parts, is founded upon observation and experiment.”
Göthe, however, does not concede even so much to Newton’s work. He
goes over a large portion of it, page by page, quarrelling with the
experiments, diagrams, reasoning, and language, without intermission;
and holds that it is not reconcileable with the most simple facts. He
declares,<a id="fnanchor24-9" href="#note24-9"><span
class="fnanchor">24</span></a> that the first time he looked through a
prism, he saw the white walls of the room still look white, “and
though alone, I pronounced, as by an instinct, that the Newtonian
doctrine is false.” We need not here point out how inconsistent with
the Newtonian doctrine it was, to expect, as Göthe expected, that the
wall should be all over colored various colors.</p>

678.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page64">64</a></span> Göthe not only
adopted and strenuously maintained the opinion that the Newtonian
theory was false, but he framed a system of his own to explain the
phenomena of color. As a matter of curiosity, it may be worth our
while to state the nature of this system; although undoubtedly it
forms no part of the <em>progress</em> of physical science. Göthe’s
views are, in fact, little different from those of Aristotle and
Antonio de Dominis, though more completely and systematically
developed. According to him, colors arise when we see through a dim
medium (“ein trübes mittel”). Light in itself is colorless; but if it
be seen through a somewhat dim medium, it appears yellow; if the
dimness of the medium increases, or if its depth be augmented, we see
the light gradually assume a yellow-red color, which finally is
heightened to a ruby-red. On the other hand, if darkness is seen
through a dim medium which is illuminated by a light falling on it, a
blue color is seen, which becomes clearer and paler, the more the
dimness of the medium increases, and darker and fuller, as the medium
becomes more transparent; and when we come to “the smallest degree of
the purest dimness,” we see the most perfect violet.<a
id="fnanchor25-9" href="#note25-9"><span
class="fnanchor">25</span></a> In addition to this “doctrine of the
dim medium,” we have a second principle asserted concerning
refraction. In a vast variety of cases, images are accompanied by
“accessory images,” as when we see bright objects in a
looking-glass.<a id="fnanchor26-9" href="#note26-9"><span
class="fnanchor">26</span></a> Now, when an image is displaced by
refraction, the displacement is not complete, clear and sharp, but
incomplete, so that there is an accessory image along with the
principal one.<a id="fnanchor27-9" href="#note27-9"><span
class="fnanchor">27</span></a> From these principles, the colors
produced by refraction in the image of a bright object on a dark
ground, are at once derivable. The accessory image is
semitransparent;<a id="fnanchor28-9" href="#note28-9"><span
class="fnanchor">28</span></a> and hence that border of it which is
pushed forwards, is drawn from the dark over the bright, and there the
yellow appears; on the other hand, where the clear border laps over
the dark ground, the blue is seen;<a id="fnanchor29-9"
href="#note29-9"><span class="fnanchor">29</span></a> and hence we
easily see that the image must appear red and yellow at one end, and
blue and violet at the other.</p>

<p>We need not explain this system further, or attempt to show how
vague and loose, as well as baseless, are the notions and modes of
conception which it introduces. Perhaps it is not difficult to point
out the peculiarities in Göthe’s intellectual character which led to
his singularly unphilosophical views on this subject. One important
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page65">65</a></span> circumstance is,
that he appears, like many persons in whom the poetical imagination is
very active, to have been destitute of the talent and the habit of
geometrical thought. In all probability, he never apprehended clearly
and steadily those relations of position on which the Newtonian
doctrine depends. Another cause of his inability to accept the
doctrine probably was, that he had conceived the “composition” of
colors in some way altogether different from that which Newton
understands by composition. What Göthe expected to see, we cannot
clearly collect; but we know, from his own statement, that his
intention of experimenting with a prism arose from his speculations on
the roles of coloring in pictures; and we can easily see that any
notion of the composition of colors which such researches would
suggest, would require to be laid aside, before he could understand
Newton’s theory of the composition of light.</p>
<p>Other objections to Newton’s theory, of a kind very different, have
been recently made by that eminent master of optical science, Sir
David Brewster. He contests Newton’s opinion, that the colored rays
into which light is separated by refraction are altogether simple and
homogeneous, and incapable of being further analysed and modified. For
he finds that by passing such rays through colored media (as blue
glass for instance), they are not only absorbed and transmitted in
very various degrees, but that some of them have their color altered;
which effect he conceives as a further analysis of the rays, one
component color being absorbed and the other transmitted.<a
id="fnanchor30-9" href="#note30-9"><span
class="fnanchor">30</span></a> And on this subject we can only say, as
we have before said, that Newton has incontestably and completely
established his doctrine, so far as analysis and decomposition <em>by
refraction</em> are concerned; but that with regard to any other
analysis, which absorbing media or other agents may produce, we have
no right from his experiments to assert, that the colors of the
spectrum are incapable of <em>such</em> decomposition. The whole
subject of the colors of objects, both opake and transparent, is still
in obscurity. Newton’s conjectures concerning the causes of the colors
of natural bodies, appear to help us little; and his opinions on that
subject are to be separated altogether from the important step which
he made in optical science, by the establishment of the true doctrine
of refractive dispersion.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note30-9"
href="#fnanchor30-9">30</a></span> This latter fact has, however, been
denied by other experimenters.</div>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [After a careful re-consideration of Sir D. Brewster’s
asserted analysis of the solar light into three colors by means of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page66">66</a></span> absorbing media,
I cannot consider that he has established his point as an exception to
Newton’s doctrine. In the first place, the analysis of light into
<em>three</em> colors appears to be quite arbitrary, granting all his
experimental facts. I do not see why, using other media, he might not
just as well have obtained other elementary colors. In the next place,
this cannot be called an <em>analysis</em> in the same sense as
Newton’s analysis, except the relation between the two is shown. Is it
meant that Newton’s experiments prove nothing? Or is Newton’s
conclusion allowed to be true of light which has not been analysed by
absorption? And where are we to find such light, since the atmosphere
absorbs? But, I must add, in the third place, that with a very sincere
admiration of Sir D. Brewster’s skill as an experimenter, I think his
experiment requires, not only limitation, but confirmation by other
experimenters. Mr. Airy repeated the experiments with about thirty
different absorbing substances, and could not satisfy himself that in
any case they changed the color of a ray of given refractive power.
These experiments were described by him at a meeting of the Cambridge
Philosophical Society.]</p>
<p>We now proceed to the corrections which the next generation
introduced into the details of this doctrine.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Discovery of Achromatism.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> discovery that the laws of
refractive dispersion of different substances were such as to allow of
combinations which neutralised the dispersion without neutralizing the
refraction, is one which has hitherto been of more value to art than
to science. The property has no definite bearing, which has yet been
satisfactorily explained, upon the <em>theory</em> of light; but it is
of the greatest importance in its application to the construction of
telescopes; and it excited the more notice, in consequence of the
prejudices and difficulties which for a time retarded the
discovery.</p>
<p>Newton conceived that he had proved by experiment,<a
id="fnanchor31-9" href="#note31-9"><span
class="fnanchor">31</span></a> that light <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page67">67</a></span> is white after refraction, when the
emergent rays are parallel to the incident, and in no other case. If
this were so, the production of colorless images by refracting media
would be impossible; and such, in deference to Newton’s great
authority, was for some time the general persuasion. Euler<a
id="fnanchor32-9" href="#note32-9"><span
class="fnanchor">32</span></a> observed, that a combination of lenses
which does not color the image must be possible, since we have an
example of such a combination in the human eye; and he investigated
mathematically the conditions requisite for such a result.
Klingenstierna,<a id="fnanchor33-9" href="#note33-9"><span
class="fnanchor">33</span></a> a Swedish mathematician, also showed
that Newton’s rule could not be universally true. Finally, John
Dollond,<a id="fnanchor34-9" href="#note34-9"><span
class="fnanchor">34</span></a> in 1757, repeated Newton’s experiment,
and obtained an opposite result. He found that when an object was seen
through two prisms, one of glass and one of water, of such angles that
it did not appear displaced by refraction, it was colored. Hence it
followed that, without being colored, the rays might be made to
undergo refraction; and that thus, substituting lenses for prisms, a
combination might be formed, which should produce an image without
coloring it, and make the construction of an <em>achromatic</em>
telescope possible.</p>

<p>Euler at first hesitated to confide in Dollond’s experiments; but
he was assured of their correctness by Clairaut, who had throughout
paid great attention to the subject; and those two great
mathematicians, as well as D’Alembert, proceeded to investigate
mathematical formulæ which might be useful in the application of the
discovery. The remainder of the deductions, which were founded upon
the laws of dispersion of various refractive substances, belongs
rather to the history of art than of science. Dollond used at first,
for his achromatic object-glass, a lens of crown-glass, and one of
flint-glass. He afterwards employed two lenses of the former
substance, including between them one of the latter, adjusting the
curvatures of his lenses in such a way as to correct the imperfections
arising from the spherical form of the glasses, as well as the fault
of color. Afterwards, Blair used fluid media along with glass lenses,
in order to produce improved object-glasses. This has more recently
been done in another form by Mr. Barlow. The inductive laws of
refraction being established, their results have been deduced by
various mathematicians, as Sir J. Herschel and Professor Airy among
ourselves, who have simplified and extended the investigation of the
formulæ which determine the best combination of lenses in the
object-glasses and eye-glasses of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page68">68</a></span> telescopes, both with reference to
spherical and to <i>chromatic</i> aberrations.</p>
<p>According to Dollond’s discovery, the colored spectra produced by
prisms of two substances, as flint-glass and crown-glass, would be of
the same length when the refraction was different. But a question then
occurred: When the whole distance from the red to the violet in one
spectrum was the same as the whole distance in the other, were the
intermediate colors, yellow, green, &amp;c., in corresponding places
in the two? This point also could not be determined any otherwise than
by experiment. It appeared that such a correspondence did not exist;
and, therefore, when the extreme colors were corrected by combinations
of the different media, there still remained an uncorrected residue of
color arising from the rest of the spectrum. This defect was a
consequence of the property, that the spectra belonging to different
media were not divided in the <em>same ratio</em> by the same colors,
and was hence termed the <i>irrationality</i> of the spectrum. By
using three prisms, or three lenses, three colors may be made to
coincide instead of two, and the effects of this irrationality greatly
diminished.</p>
<p>For the reasons already mentioned, we do not pursue this subject
further,<a id="fnanchor35-9" href="#note35-9"><span
class="fnanchor">35</span></a> but turn to those optical facts which
finally led to a great and comprehensive theory.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note35-9"
href="#fnanchor35-9">35</a></span> The discovery of the <i>fixed
lines</i> in the spectrum, by Wollaston and Fraunhofer, has more
recently supplied the means of determining, with extreme accuracy, the
corresponding portions of the spectrum in different refracting
substances.</div>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [Mr. Chester More Hall, of More Hall, in Essex, is said
to have been led by the study of the human eye, which he conceived to
be achromatic, to construct achromatic telescopes as early as 1729.
Mr. Hall, however, kept his invention a secret. David Gregory, in his
<i>Catoptrics</i> (1713), had suggested that it would perhaps be an
improvement of telescopes, if, in imitation of the human eye, the
object-glass were composed of different media. <i>Encyc. Brit.</i>
art. <i>Optics</i>.</p>
<p>It is said that Clairaut first discovered the irrationality of the
colored spaces in the spectrum. In consequence of this irrationality,
it follows that when two refracting media are so combined as to
correct each other’s extreme dispersion, (the separation of the red
and violet rays,) this first step of correction still leaves a residue
of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page69">69</a></span> coloration
arising from the unequal dispersion of the intermediate rays (the
green, &amp;c.). These <i>outstanding</i> colors, as they were termed
by Professor Robison, form the residual, or <i>secondary</i>
spectrum.</p>
<p>Dr. Blair, by very ingenious devices, succeeded in producing an
object-glass, corrected by a fluid lens, in which this aberration of
color was completely corrected, and which performed wonderfully
well.</p>
<p>The dispersion produced by a prism may be corrected by another
prism of the <em>same substance</em> and of a different angle. In this
case also there is an irrationality in the colored spaces, which
prevents the correction of color from being complete; and hence, a new
residuary spectrum, which has been called the <i>tertiary</i>
spectrum, by Sir David Brewster, who first noticed it.</p>
<p>I have omitted, in the notice of discoveries respecting the
spectrum, many remarkable trains of experimental research, and
especially the investigations respecting the power of various media to
absorb the light of different parts of the spectrum, prosecuted by Sir
David Brewster with extraordinary skill and sagacity. The observations
are referred to in <a href="#v2page65">chapter iii</a>. Sir John
Herschel, Prof. Miller, Mr. Daniel, Dr. Faraday, and Mr. Talbot, have
also contributed to this part of our knowledge.]</p>
<hr class="three space-above" />
<h3>CHAPTER V.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Discovery of the Laws of Double
Refraction.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> laws of refraction which
we have hitherto described, were simple and uniform, and had a
symmetrical reference to the surface of the refracting medium. It
appeared strange to men, when their attention was drawn to a class of
phenomena in which this symmetry was wanting, and in which a
refraction took place which was not even in the plane of incidence.
The subject was not unworthy the notice and admiration it attracted;
for the prosecution of it ended in the discovery of the general laws
of light. The phenomena of which I now speak, are those exhibited by
various kinds of crystalline bodies; but observed for a long time in
one kind only, namely, the rhombohedral calc-spar; or, as it was
usually termed, from the country which supplied the largest and
clearest crystals, <i>Iceland spar</i>. These <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page70">70</a></span> rhombohedral crystals are usually very
smooth and transparent, and often of considerable size; and it was
observed, on looking through them, that all objects appeared double.
The phenomena, even as early as 1669, had been considered so curious,
that Erasmus Bartholin published a work upon them at Copenhagen,<a
id="fnanchor36-9" href="#note36-9"><span
class="fnanchor">36</span></a> (<i>Experimenta Crystalli
Islandici</i>, Hafniæ, 1669.) He analysed the phenomena into their
laws, so far as to discover that one of the two images was produced by
refraction after the usual rule, and the other by an unusual
refraction. This latter refraction Bartholin found to vary in
different positions; to be regulated by a line parallel to the sides
of the rhombohedron; and to be greatest in the direction of a line
bisecting two of the angles of the rhombic face of the crystal.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note36-9"
href="#fnanchor36-9">36</a></span> Priestley’s <i>Optics</i>, p.
550.</div>
<p>These rules were exact as far as they went; and when we consider
how geometrically complex the law is, which really regulates the
unusual or extraordinary refraction;&#8212;that Newton altogether
mistook it, and that it was not verified till the experiments of Haüy
and Wollaston in our own time;&#8212;we might expect that it would not
be soon or easily detected. But Huyghens possessed a key to the
secret, in the theory, which he had devised, of the propagation of
light by undulations, and which he conceived with perfect distinctness
and correctness, so far as its application to these phenomena is
concerned. Hence he was enabled to lay down the law of the phenomena
(the only part of his discovery which we have here to consider), with
a precision and success which excited deserved admiration, when the
subject, at a much later period, regained its due share of attention.
His Treatise was written<a id="fnanchor37-9" href="#note37-9"><span
class="fnanchor">37</span></a> in 1678, but not published till
1690.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note37-9"
href="#fnanchor37-9">37</a></span> See his <i>Traité de la
Lumière</i>. Preface.</div>
<p>The laws of the <i>ordinary</i> and the <i>extraordinary</i>
refraction in Iceland spar are related to each other; they are, in
fact, similar constructions, made, in the one case, by means of an
imaginary sphere, in the other, by means of a spheroid; the spheroid
being of such oblateness as to suit the rhombohedral form of the
crystal, and the axis of the spheroid being the axis of symmetry of
the crystal. Huyghens followed this general conception into particular
positions and conditions; and thus obtained rules, which he compared
with observation, for cutting the crystal and transmitting the rays in
various manners. “I have examined in detail,” says he,<a
id="fnanchor38-9" href="#note38-9"><span
class="fnanchor">38</span></a> “the properties of the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page71">71</a></span> extraordinary
refraction of this crystal, to see if each phenomenon which is deduced
from theory, would agree with what is really observed. And this being
so, it is no slight proof of the truth of our suppositions and
principles; but what I am going to add here confirms them still more
wonderfully; that is, the different modes of cutting this crystal, in
which the surfaces produced give rise to refractions exactly such as
they ought to be, and as I had foreseen them, according to the
preceding theory.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note38-9"
href="#fnanchor38-9">38</a></span> See Maseres’s <i>Tracts on
Optics</i>, p. 250; or Huyghens, <i>Tr. sur la Lum.</i> ch. v. Art.
43.</div>
<p>Statements of this kind, coming from a philosopher like Huyghens,
were entitled to great confidence; Newton, however, appears not to
have noticed, or to have disregarded them. In his <i>Opticks</i>, he
gives a rule for the extraordinary refraction of Iceland spar which is
altogether erroneous, without assigning any reason for rejecting the
law published by Huyghens; and, so far as appears, without having made
any experiments of his own. The Huyghenian doctrine of double
refraction fell, along with his theory of undulations, into temporary
neglect, of which we shall have <a href="#undulatory">hereafter</a> to
speak. But in 1788, Haüy showed that Huyghens’s rule agreed much
better than Newton’s with the phenomena: and in 1802, Wollaston,
applying a method of his own for measuring refraction, came to the
same result. “He made,” says Young,<a id="fnanchor39-9"
href="#note39-9"><span class="fnanchor">39</span></a> “a number of
accurate experiments with an apparatus singularly well calculated to
examine the phenomena, but could find no general principle to connect
them, until the work of Huyghens was pointed out to him.” In 1808, the
subject of double refraction was proposed as a prize-question by the
French Institute; and Malus, whose Memoir obtained the prize, says, “I
began by observing and measuring a long series of phenomena on natural
and artificial faces of Iceland spar. Then, testing by means of these
observations the different laws proposed up to the present time by
physical writers, I was struck with the admirable agreement of the law
of Huyghens with the phenomena, and I was soon convinced that it is
really the law of nature.” Pursuing the consequences of the law, he
found that it satisfied phenomena which Huyghens himself had not
observed. From this time, then, the truth of the Huyghenian law was
universally allowed, and soon afterwards, the theory by which it had
been suggested was generally received.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note39-9"
href="#fnanchor39-9">39</a></span> <i>Quart. Rev.</i> 1809, Nov. p.
338.</div>
<p>The property of double refraction had been first studied only in
Iceland spar, in which it is very obvious. The same property belongs,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page72">72</a></span> though less
conspicuously, to many other kinds of crystals. Huyghens had noticed
the same fact in rock-crystal;<a id="fnanchor40-9"
href="#note40-9"><span class="fnanchor">40</span></a> and Malus found
it to belong to a large list of bodies besides; for instance,
arragonite, sulphate of lime, of baryta, of strontia, of iron;
carbonate of lead; zircon, corundum, cymophane, emerald, euclase,
felspar, mesotype, peridote, sulphur, and mellite. Attempts were made,
with imperfect success, to reduce all these to the law which had been
established for Iceland spar. In the first instance, Malus took for
granted that the extraordinary refraction depended always upon an
oblate spheroid; but M. Biot<a id="fnanchor41-9"
href="#note41-9"><span class="fnanchor">41</span></a> pointed out a
distinction between two classes of crystals in which this spheroid was
oblong and oblate respectively, and these he called <i>attractive</i>
and <i>repulsive</i> crystals. With this correction, the law could be
extended to a considerable number of cases; but it was afterwards
proved by Sir D. Brewster’s discoveries, that even in this form, it
belonged only to substances of which the crystallization has relation
to a single axis of symmetry, as the rhombohedron, or the square
pyramid. In other cases, as the rhombic prism, in which the form,
considered with reference to its crystalline symmetry, is
<i>biaxal</i>, the law is much more complicated. In that case, the
sphere and the spheroid, which are used in the construction for
uniaxal crystals, transform themselves into the two successful
convolutions of a single continuous curve surface; neither of the two
rays follows the law of ordinary refraction; and the formula which
determines their position is very complex. It is, however, capable of
being tested by measures of the refractions of crystals cut in a
peculiar manner for the purpose, and this was done by MM. Fresnel and
Arago. But this complex law of double refraction was only discovered
through the aid of the theory of a luminiferous ether, and therefore
we must now return to the other facts which led to such a theory.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Discovery of the Laws of Polarization.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IF</span> the Extraordinary
Refraction of Iceland spar had appeared strange, another phenomenon
was soon noticed in the same <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page73">73</a></span> substance, which appeared stranger still,
and which in the sequel was found to be no less important. I speak of
the facts which were afterwards described under the term
<i>Polarization</i>. Huyghens was the discoverer of this class of
facts. At the end of the treatise which we have already quoted, he
says,<a id="fnanchor42-9" href="#note42-9"><span
class="fnanchor">42</span></a> “Before I quit the subject of this
crystal, I will add one other marvellous phenomenon, which I have
discovered since writing the above; for though hitherto I have not
been able to find out its cause, I will not, on that account, omit
pointing it out, that I may give occasion to others to examine it.” He
then states the phenomena; which are, that when two rhombohedrons of
Iceland spar are in parallel positions, a ray doubly refracted by the
first, is not further divided when it falls on the second: the
ordinarily refracted ray is ordinarily refracted <em>only</em>, and
the extraordinary ray is only extraordinarily refracted by the second
crystal, neither ray being doubly refracted. The same is still the
case, if the two crystals have their <em>principal planes</em>
parallel, though they themselves are not parallel. But if the
principal plane of the second crystal be perpendicular to that of the
first, the reverse of what has been described takes place; the
ordinarily refracted ray of the first crystal suffers, at the second,
extraordinary refraction <em>only</em>, and the extraordinary ray of
the first suffers ordinary refraction only at the second. Thus, in
each of these positions, the double refraction of each ray at the
second crystal is reduced to single refraction, though in a different
manner in the two cases. But in any other position of the crystals,
each ray, produced by the first, is doubly refracted by the second, so
as to produce four rays.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note42-9"
href="#fnanchor42-9">42</a></span> <i>Tr. Opt.</i> p. 252.</div>
<p>A step in the right conception of these phenomena was made by
Newton, in the second edition of his <i>Opticks</i> (1717). He
represented them as resulting from this;&#8212;that the rays of light
have “sides,” and that they undergo the ordinary or extraordinary
refraction, according as these sides are parallel to the principal
plane of the crystal, or at right angles to it (Query 26). In this
way, it is clear, that those rays which, in the first crystal, had
been selected for extraordinary refraction, because their sides were
perpendicular to the principal plane, would all suffer extraordinary
refraction at the second crystal for the same reason, if its principal
plane were parallel to that of the first; and would all suffer
ordinary refraction, if the principal plane of the second crystal were
perpendicular to that of the first, and <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page74">74</a></span> consequently parallel to the sides of the
refracted ray. This view of the subject includes some of the leading
features of the case, but still leaves several considerable
difficulties.</p>
<p>No material advance was made in the subject till it was taken up by
Malus,<a id="fnanchor43-9" href="#note43-9"><span
class="fnanchor">43</span></a> along with the other circumstances of
double refraction, about a hundred years afterwards. He verified what
had been observed by Huyghens and Newton, on the subject of the
variations which light thus exhibits; but he discovered that this
modification, in virtue of which light undergoes the ordinary, or the
extraordinary, refraction, according to the position of the plane of
the crystal, may be impressed upon it many other ways. One part of
this discovery was made accidentally.<a id="fnanchor44-9"
href="#note44-9"><span class="fnanchor">44</span></a> In 1808, Malus
happened to be observing the light of the setting sun, reflected from
the windows of the Luxembourg, through a rhombohedron of Iceland spar;
and he observed that in turning round the crystal, the two images
varied in their intensity. Neither of the images completely vanished,
because the light from the windows was not properly modified, or, to
use the term which Malus soon adopted, was not completely
<i>polarized</i>. The complete polarization of light by reflection
from glass, or any other transparent substance, was found to take
place at a certain definite angle, different for each substance. It
was found also that in all crystals in which double refraction
occurred, the separation of the refracted rays was accompanied by
polarization; the two rays, the ordinary and the extraordinary, being
always polarized <em>oppositely</em>, that is, in planes at right
angles to each other. The term <i>poles</i>, used by Malus, conveyed
nearly the same notion as the term <i>sides</i> which had been
employed by Newton, with the additional conception of a property which
appeared or disappeared according as the <em>poles</em> of the particles were
or were not in a certain direction; a property thus resembling the
<i>polarity</i> of magnetic bodies. When a spot of polarized light is
looked at through a transparent crystal of Iceland spar, each of the
two images produced by the double refraction varies in brightness as
the crystal is turned round. If, for the sake of example, we suppose
the crystal to be turned round in the direction of the points of the
compass, N, E, S, W, and if one image be brightest when the crystal
marks N and S, it will disappear when the crystal marks E and W: and
on the contrary, the second image will vanish when the crystal marks N
and S, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page75">75</a></span> and will
be brightest when the crystal marks E and W. The first of these images
is polarized <i>in the plane</i> NS passing through the ray, and the
second <i>in the plane</i> EW, perpendicular to the other. And these
rays are <i>oppositely</i> polarized. It was further found that
whether the ray were polarized by reflection from glass, or from
water, or by double refraction, the modification of light so produced,
or the nature of the polarization, was identical in all these
cases;&#8212;that the alternatives of ordinary and extraordinary
refraction and non-refraction, were the same, by whatever crystal they
were tested, or in whatever manner the polarization had been impressed
upon the light; in short, that the property, when once acquired, was
independent of everything except the sides or <i>poles</i> of the ray;
and thus, in 1811, the term “polarization” was introduced.<a

<p>This being the state of the subject, it became an obvious question,
by what other means, and according to what laws, this property was
communicated. It was found that some crystals, instead of giving, by
double refraction, two images oppositely polarized, give a single
polarized image. This property was discovered in the agate by Sir D.
Brewster, and in tourmaline by M. Biot and Dr. Seebeck. The latter
mineral became, in consequence, a very convenient part of the
apparatus used in such observations. Various peculiarities bearing
upon this subject, were detected by different experimenters. It was in
a short time discovered, that light might be polarized by refraction,
as well as by reflection, at the surface of uncrystallized bodies, as
glass; the plane of polarization being perpendicular to the plane of
refraction; further, that when a portion of a ray of light was
polarized by reflection, a corresponding portion was polarized by
transmission, the planes of the two polarizations being at right
angles to each other. It was found also that the polarization which
was incomplete with a single plate, either by reflection or
refraction, might be made more and more complete by increasing the
number of plates.</p>
<p>Among an accumulation of phenomena like this, it is our business to
inquire what general laws were discovered. To make such discoveries
without possessing the general theory of the facts, required no
ordinary sagacity and good fortune. Yet several laws were detected at
this stage of the subject. Malus, in 1811, obtained the important
generalization that, whenever we obtain, by any means, a polarized ray
of light, we produce also another ray, polarized in a contrary <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page76">76</a></span> direction; thus when
reflection gives a polarized ray, the companion-ray is refracted
polarized oppositely, along with a quantity of unpolarized light. And
we must particularly notice <i>Sir D. Brewster’s rule</i> for the
<i>polarizing angle</i> of different bodies.</p>
<p>Malus<a id="fnanchor46-9" href="#note46-9"><span
class="fnanchor">46</span></a> had said that the angle of reflection
from transparent bodies which most completely polarizes the reflected
ray, does not follow any discoverable rule with regard to the order of
refractive or dispersive powers of the substances. Yet the rule was in
reality very simple. In 1815, Sir D. Brewster stated<a
id="fnanchor47-9" href="#note47-9"><span
class="fnanchor">47</span></a> as the law, which in all cases
determines this angle, that “the index of refraction is the tangent of
the angle of polarization.” It follows from this, that the
polarization takes place when the reflected and refracted rays are at
right angles to each other. This simple and elegant rule has been
fully confirmed by all subsequent observations, as by those of MM.
Biot and Seebeck; and must be considered one of the happiest and most
important discoveries of the laws of phenomena in Optics.</p>

<p>The rule for polarization by one reflection being thus discovered,
tentative formulæ were proposed by Sir D. Brewster and M. Biot, for
the cases in which several reflections or refractions take place.
Fresnel also in 1817 and 1818, traced the effect of reflection in
modifying the direction of polarization, which Malus had done
inaccurately in 1810. But the complexity of the subject made all such
attempts extremely precarious, till the theory of the phenomena was
understood, a period which now comes under notice. The laws which we
have spoken of were important materials for the establishment of the
theory; but in the mean time, its progress at first had been more
forwarded by some other classes of facts, of a different kind, and of
a longer standing notoriety, to which we must now turn our
attention.</p>

<h3 id="b9-7">CHAPTER VII.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Discovery of the Laws of the Colours of Thin
Plates.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> facts which we have now to
consider are remarkable, inasmuch as the colours are produced merely
by the smallness of dimensions of the bodies employed. The light is
not analysed by any peculiar <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page77">77</a></span> property of the substances, but dissected
by the minuteness of their parts. On this account, these phenomena
give very important indications of the real structure of light; and at
an early period, suggested views which are, in a great measure,
just.</p>
<p>Hooke appears to be the first person who made any progress in
discovering the laws of the colors of thin plates. In his
<i>Micrographia</i>, printed by the Royal Society in 1664, he
describes, in a detailed and systematic manner, several phenomena of
this kind, which he calls “fantastical colors.” He examined them in
<i>Muscovy glass</i> or mica, a transparent mineral which is capable
of being split into the exceedingly thin films which are requisite for
such colors; he noticed them also in the fissures of the same
substance, in bubbles blown of water, rosin, gum, glass; in the films
on the surface of tempered steel; between two plane pieces of glass;
and in other cases. He perceived also,<a id="fnanchor48-9"
href="#note48-9"><span class="fnanchor">48</span></a> that the
production of each color required a plate of determinate thickness,
and he employed this circumstance as one of the grounds of his theory
of light.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note48-9"
href="#fnanchor48-9">48</a></span> <i>Micrographia</i>, p. 53.</div>
<p>Newton took up the subject where Hooke had left it; and followed it
out with his accustomed skill and clearness, in his <i>Discourse on
Light and Colors</i>, communicated to the Royal Society in 1675. He
determined, what Hooke had not ascertained, the thickness of the film
which was requisite for the production of each color; and in this way
explained, in a complete and admirable manner, the colored rings which
occur when two lenses are pressed together, and the <i>scale of
color</i> which the rings follow; a step of the more consequence, as
the same scale occurs in many other optical phenomena.</p>
<p>It is not our business here to state the hypothesis with regard to
the properties of light which Newton founded on these facts;&#8212;the
“fits of easy transmission and reflection.” We shall see hereafter
that his attempted induction was imperfect; and his endeavor to
account, by means of the laws of thin plates, for the colors of
natural bodies, is altogether unsatisfactory. But notwithstanding
these failures in the speculations on this subject, he did make in it
some very important steps; for he clearly ascertained that when the
thickness of the plate was about <span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>178000</sub></span>th of an inch, or
three times, five times, seven times that magnitude, there was a
bright color produced; but blackness, when the thickness was exactly
intermediate between those magnitudes. He found, also, that the
thicknesses which gave red and <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page78">78</a></span> violet<a id="fnanchor49-9"
href="#note49-9"><span class="fnanchor">49</span></a> were as fourteen
to nine; and the intermediate colors of course corresponded to
intermediate thicknesses, and therefore, in his apparatus, consisting
of two lenses pressed together, appeared as rings of intermediate
sizes. His mode of confirming the rule, by throwing upon this
apparatus differently colored homogeneous light, is striking and
elegant. “It was very pleasant,” he says, “to see the rings gradually
swell and contract as the color of the light was changed.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note49-9"
href="#fnanchor49-9">49</a></span> <i>Opticks</i>, p. 184.</div>
<p>It is not necessary to enter further into the detail of these
phenomena, or to notice the rings seen by transmission, and other
circumstances. The important step made by Newton in this matter was,
the showing that the rays of light, in these experiments, as they pass
onwards go periodically through certain cycles of modification, each
period occupying nearly the small fraction of an inch mentioned above;
and this interval being different for different colors. Although
Newton did not correctly disentangle the conditions under which this
periodical character is manifestly disclosed, the discovery that,
under some circumstances, such a periodical character does exist, was
likely to influence, and did influence, materially and beneficially,
the subsequent progress of Optics towards a connected theory.</p>
<p>We must now trace this progress; but before we proceed to this
task, we will briefly notice a number of optical phenomena which had
been collected, and which waited for the touch of sound theory to
introduce among them that rule and order which mere observation had
sought for in vain.</p>
<hr class="three space-above" />
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Attempts to discover the Laws of other
Phenomena.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> phenomena which result
from optical combinations, even of a comparatively simple nature, are
extremely complex. The theory which is now known accounts for these
results with the most curious exactness, and points out the laws which
pervade the apparent confusion; but without this key to the
appearances, it was scarcely possible that any rule or order should be
detected. The undertaking was of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page79">79</a></span> the same kind as it would have been, to
discover all the inequalities of the moon’s motion without the aid of
the doctrine of gravity. We will enumerate some of the phenomena which
thus employed and perplexed the cultivators of optics.</p>
<p>The fringes of shadows were one of the most curious and noted of
such classes of facts. These were first remarked by Grimaldi<a
id="fnanchor50-9" href="#note50-9"><span
class="fnanchor">50</span></a> (1665), and referred by him to a
property of light which he called <i>Diffraction</i>. When shadows are
made in a dark room, by light admitted through a very small hole,
these appearances are very conspicuous and beautiful. Hooke, in 1672,
communicated similar observations to the Royal Society, as “a new
property of light not mentioned by any optical writer before;” by
which we see that he had not heard of Grimaldi’s experiments. Newton,
in his <i>Opticks</i>, treats of the same phenomena, which he ascribes
to the <i>inflexion</i> of the rays of light. He asks (Qu. 3), “Are
not the rays of light, in passing by the edges and sides of bodies,
bent several times backward and forward with a motion like that of an
eel? And do not the three fringes of colored light in shadows arise
from three such bendings?” It is remarkable that Newton should not
have noticed, that it is impossible, in this way, to account for the
facts, or even to express their laws; since the light which produces
the fringes must, on this theory, be propagated, even after it leaves
the neighborhood of the opake body, in curves, and not in straight
lines. Accordingly, all who have taken up Newton’s notion of
inflexion, have inevitably failed in giving anything like an
intelligible and coherent character to these phenomena. This is, for
example, the case with Mr. (now Lord) Brougham’s attempts in the
<i>Philosophical Transactions</i> for 1796. The same may be said of
other experimenters, as Mairan<a id="fnanchor51-9"
href="#note51-9"><span class="fnanchor">51</span></a> and Du Four,<a
id="fnanchor52-9" href="#note52-9"><span
class="fnanchor">52</span></a> who attempted to explain the facts by
supposing an atmosphere about the opake body. Several authors, as
Maraldi,<a id="fnanchor53-9" href="#note53-9"><span
class="fnanchor">53</span></a> and Comparetti,<a id="fnanchor54-9"
href="#note54-9"><span class="fnanchor">54</span></a> repeated or
varied these experiments in different ways.</p>

<p>Newton had noticed certain rings of color produced by a glass
speculum, which he called “colors of thick plates,” and which he
attempted to connect with the colors of thin plates. His reasoning is
by no means satisfactory; but it was of use, by pointing out this as a
case in which his “fits” (the small periods, or cycles in the rays of
light, of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page80">80</a></span> which
we have spoken) continued to occur for a considerable length of the
ray. But other persons, attempting to repeat his experiments,
confounded with them extraneous phenomena of other kinds; as the Duc
de Chaulnes, who spread muslin before his mirror,<a id="fnanchor55-9"
href="#note55-9"><span class="fnanchor">55</span></a> and Dr.
Herschel, who scattered hair-powder before his.<a id="fnanchor56-9"
href="#note56-9"><span class="fnanchor">56</span></a> The colors
produced by the muslin were those belonging to shadows of
<i>gratings</i>, afterwards examined more successfully by Fraunhofer,
when in possession of the theory. We may mention here also the colors
which appear on finely-striated surfaces, and on mother-of-pearl,
feathers, and similar substances. These had been examined by various
persons (as Boyle, Mazeas, Lord Brougham), but could still, at this
period, be only looked upon as insulated and lawless facts.</p>

<h3 id="b9-9">CHAPTER IX.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Discovery of the Laws of Phenomena of Dipolarized
Light.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">BESIDES</span> the above-mentioned
perplexing cases of colors produced by common light, cases of
<i>periodical colors produced by polarized light</i> began to be
discovered, and soon became numerous. In August, 1811, M. Arago
communicated to the Institute of France an account of colors seen by
passing polarized light through mica, and <i>analysing</i><a
id="fnanchor57-9" href="#note57-9"><span
class="fnanchor">57</span></a> it with a prism of Iceland spar. It is
remarkable that the light which produced the colors in this case was
the light polarized by the sky, a cause of polarization not previously
known. The effect which the mica thus produced was termed
<i>depolarization</i>;&#8212;not a very happy term, since the effect
is not the destruction of the polarization, but the combination of a
new polarizing influence with the former. The word
<i>dipolarization</i>, which has since been proposed, is a much more
appropriate expression. Several other curious phenomena of the same
kind were observed in quartz, and in flint-glass. M. Arago was not
able to reduce these phenomena to laws, but he had a full conviction
of their value, and ventures to class them with the great steps in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page81">81</a></span> this part of
optics. “To Bartholin we owe the knowledge of double refraction; to
Huyghens, that of the accompanying polarization; to Malus,
polarization by reflection; to Arago, depolarization.” Sir D. Brewster
was at the same time engaged in a similar train of research; and made
discoveries of the same nature, which, though not published till some
time after those of Arago, were obtained without a knowledge of what
had been done by him. Sir D. Brewster’s <i>Treatise on New
Philosophical Instruments</i>, published in 1813, contains many
curious experiments on the “depolarizing” properties of minerals. Both
these observers noticed the changes of color which are produced by
changes in the position of the ray, and the alternations of color in
the two oppositely polarized images; and Sir D. Brewster discovered
that, in topaz, the phenomena had a certain reference to lines which
he called the <i>neutral</i> and <i>depolarizing</i> axes. M. Biot had
endeavored to reduce the phenomena to a law; and had succeeded so far,
that he found that in the plates of sulphate of lime, the place of the
tint, estimated in Newton’s <i>scale</i> (see <i>ante</i>, <a
href="#v2page77">chap. vii.</a>), was as the square of the sine of the
inclination. But the laws of these phenomena became much more obvious
when they were observed by Sir D. Brewster with a larger field of
view.<a id="fnanchor58-9" href="#note58-9"><span
class="fnanchor">58</span></a> He found that the colors of topaz,
under the circumstances now described, exhibited themselves in the
form of elliptical rings, crossed by a black bar, “the most brilliant
class of phenomena,” as he justly says, “in the whole range of
optics.” In 1814, also, Wollaston observed the circular rings with a
black cross, produced by similar means in calc-spar; and M. Biot, in
1815, made the same observation. The rings in several of these cases
were carefully measured by M. Biot and Sir D. Brewster, and a great
mass of similar phenomena was discovered. These were added to by
various persons, as M. Seebeck, and Sir John Herschel.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note57-9"
href="#fnanchor57-9">57</a></span> The prism of Iceland spar produces
the colors by separating the transmitted rays according to the laws of
double refraction. Hence it is said to <i>analyse</i> the light.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note58-9"
href="#fnanchor58-9">58</a></span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1814.</div>
<p>Sir D. Brewster, in 1818, discovered a general relation between the
crystalline form and the optical properties, which gave an
incalculable impulse and a new clearness to these researches. He found
that there was a correspondence between the degree of symmetry of the
optical phenomena and the crystalline form; those crystals which are
uniaxal in the crystallographical sense, are also uniaxal in their
optical properties, and give circular rings; those which are of other
forms are, generally speaking, biaxal; they give oval and knotted
<i>isochromatic</i> lines, with two <i>poles</i>. He also discovered a
rule for the tint at each point <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page82">82</a></span> in such cases; and thus explained, so far
as an empirical law of phenomena went, the curious and various forms
of the colored curves. This law, when simplified by M. Biot,<a
id="fnanchor59-9" href="#note59-9"><span
class="fnanchor">59</span></a> made the tint proportional to the
product of the distances of the point from the two poles. In the
following year, Sir J. Herschel confirmed this law by showing, from
actual measurement, that the curve of the isochromatic lines in these
cases was the curve termed the <i>lemniscata</i>, which has, for each
point, the product of the distances from two fixed poles equal to a
constant quantity.<a id="fnanchor60-9" href="#note60-9"><span
class="fnanchor">60</span></a> He also reduced to rule some other
apparent anomalies in phenomena of the same class.</p>

href="#fnanchor60-9">60</a></span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1819.</div>
<p>M. Biot, too, gave a rule for the directions of the planes of
polarization of the two rays produced by double refraction in biaxal
crystals, a circumstance which has a close bearing upon the phenomena
of dipolarization. His rule was, that the one plane of polarization
bisects the dihedral angle formed by the two planes which pass through
the optic axes, and that the other is perpendicular to such a plane.
When, however, Fresnel had discovered from the theory the true laws of
double refraction, it appeared that the above rule is inaccurate,
although in a degree which observation could hardly detect without the
aid of theory.<a id="fnanchor61-9" href="#note61-9"><span
class="fnanchor">61</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note61-9"

p. 162.</div>
<p>There were still other classes of optical phenomena which attracted
notice; especially those which are exhibited by plates of quartz cut
perpendicular to the axis. M. Arago had observed, in 1811, that this
substance produced a <i>twist</i> of the plane of polarization to the
right or left hand, the amount of this twist being different for
different colors; a result which was afterwards traced to a
modification of light different both from common and from polarized
light, and subsequently known as <i>circular polarization</i>. Sir J.
Herschel had the good fortune and sagacity to discover that this
peculiar kind of polarization in quartz was connected with an equally
peculiar modification of crystallization, the <i>plagihedral</i> faces
which are seen, on some crystals, obliquely disposed, and, as it were,
following each other round the crystal from left to right, or from
right to left. Sir J. Herschel found that the <i>right-handed</i> or
<i>left-handed</i> character of the circular polarization
corresponded, in all cases, to that of the crystal.</p>
<p>In 1815, M. Biot, in his researches on the subject of circular
polarization, was led to the unexpected and curious discovery, that
this <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page83">83</a></span> property
which seemed to require for its very conception a crystalline
structure in the body, belonged nevertheless to several fluids, and in
different directions for different fluids. Oil of turpentine, and an
essential oil of laurel, gave the plane of polarization a rotation to
the left hand; oil of citron, syrup of sugar, and a solution of
camphor, gave a rotation to the right hand. Soon after, the like
discovery was made independently by Dr. Seebeck, of Berlin.</p>
<p>It will easily be supposed that all those brilliant phenomena could
not be observed, and the laws of many of the phenomena discovered,
without attempts on the part of philosophers to combine them all under
the dominion of some wide and profound theory. Endeavors to ascend
from such knowledge as we have spoken of, to the general theory of
light, were, in fact, made at every stage of the subject, and with a
success which at last won almost all suffrages. We are now arrived at
the point at which we are called upon to trace the history of this
theory; to pass from the laws of phenomena to their causes;&#8212;from
Formal to Physical Optics. The undulatory theory of light, the only
discovery which can stand by the side of the theory of universal
gravitation, as a doctrine belonging to the same order, for its
generality, its fertility, and its certainty, may properly be treated
of with that ceremony which we have hitherto bestowed only on the
great advances of astronomy; and I shall therefore now proceed to
speak of the Prelude to this epoch, the Epoch itself, and its Sequel,
according to the form of the preceding Book which treats of
astronomy.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [I ought to have stated, in the beginning of this
chapter, that Malus discovered the depolarization of <em>white
light</em> in 1811. He found that a pencil of light which, being
polarized, refused to be reflected by a surface properly placed,
recovered its power of being reflected after being transmitted through
certain crystals and other transparent bodies. Malus intended to
pursue this subject, when his researches were terminated by his death,
Feb. 7, 1812. M. Arago, about the same time, announced his important
discovery of the depolarization of <em>colors</em> by crystals.</p>
<p>I may add, to what is <a href="#v2page82">above</a> said of M.
Biot’s discoveries respecting the circular polarizing power of fluids,
that he pursued his researches so as to bring into view some most
curious relations among the elements of bodies. It appeared that
certain substances, as sugar of canes, had a right-handed effect, and
certain other substances, as gum, a left-handed effect; and that the
molecular value of this effect was not altered by dilution. It
appeared also that a certain element of the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page84">84</a></span> substance of fruits, which had been
supposed to be gum, and which is changed into sugar by the operation
of acids, is not gum, and has a very energetic right-handed effect.
This substance M. Biot called <i>dextrine</i>, and he has since traced
its effects into many highly curious and important results.<span

<p class="drop"><span class="sc">BY</span> <i>Physical</i> Optics we
mean, as has already been stated, the theories which explain optical
phenomena on mechanical principles. No such explanation could be given
till true mechanical principles had been obtained; and, accordingly,
we must date the commencement of the essays towards physical optics
from Descartes, the founder of the modern mechanical philosophy. His
hypothesis concerning light is, that it consists of small particles
emitted by the luminous body. He compares these particles to balls,
and endeavors to explain, by means of this comparison, the laws of
reflection and refraction.<a id="fnanchor62-9" href="#note62-9"><span

of colors by refraction, he ascribes to these balls an alternating

theory</i>, was, like most of the physical speculations of its author,
hasty and gratuitous; but was extensively accepted, like the rest of
the Cartesian doctrines, in consequence of the love which men have for
sweeping and simple dogmas, and deductive reasonings from them. In a
short time, however, the rival optical <i>theory of undulations</i>
made its appearance. Hooke in his <i>Micrographia</i> (1664) propounds
it, upon occasion of his observations, already noticed, (<a
href="#b9-7">chap. <span class="correction" title="emended from
viii.">vii.</span></a>,) on the colors of thin plates. He there
asserts<a id="fnanchor64-9" href="#note64-9"><span
class="fnanchor">64</span></a> light to consist in a “quick, short,
vibrating motion,” and that it is propagated in a homogeneous medium,
in such a way that “every pulse or vibration of the luminous body will
generate a sphere, which will continually increase and grow bigger,
just after the same manner (though indefinitely swifter) as the waves
or rings on the surface of water do swell into bigger and bigger
circles about a point in it.”<a id="fnanchor65-9"
href="#note65-9"><span class="fnanchor">65</span></a> He applies this
to the explanation of refraction, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page86">86</a></span> by supposing that the rays in a denser
medium move more easily, and hence that the pulses become oblique; a
far less satisfactory and consistent hypothesis than that of Huyghens,
of which we shall next have to speak. But Hooke has the merit of
having also combined with his theory, though somewhat obscurely, the
<i>Principle of Interferences</i>, in the application which he makes
of it to the colors of thin plates. Thus<a id="fnanchor66-9"
href="#note66-9"><span class="fnanchor">66</span></a> he supposes the
light to be reflected at the first surface of such plates; and he
adds, “after two refractions and one reflection (from the second
surface) there is propagated a kind of fainter ray,” which comes
behind the other reflected pulse; “so that hereby (the surfaces <span
class="sc">ab</span> and <span class="sc">ef</span> being so near
together that the eye cannot discriminate them from one), this
compound or duplicated pulse does produce on the retina the sensation
of a yellow.” The reason for the production of this particular color,
in the case of which he here speaks, depends on his views concerning
the kind of pulses appropriate to each color; and, for the same
reason, when the thickness is different, he finds that the result will
be a red or a green. This is a very remarkable anticipation of the
explanation ultimately given of these colors; and we may observe that
if Hooke could have measured the thickness of his thin plates, he
could hardly have avoided making considerable progress in the doctrine
of interferences.</p>

<p>But the person who is generally, and with justice, looked upon as
the great author of the undulatory theory, at the period now under
notice, is Huyghens, whose <i>Traité de la Lumière</i>, containing a
developement of his theory, was written in 1678, though not published
till 1690. In this work he maintained, as Hooke had done, that light
consists in undulations, and expands itself spherically, nearly in the
same manner as sound does; and he referred to the observations of
Römer on Jupiter’s satellites, both to prove that this difference
takes place successively, and to show its exceeding swiftness. In
order to trace the effect of an undulation, Huyghens considers that
every point of a wave diffuses its motion in all directions; and hence
he draws the conclusion, so long looked upon as the turning-point of
the combat between the rival theories, that the light will not be
<i>diffused</i> beyond the rectilinear space, when it passes through
an aperture; “for,” says he,<a id="fnanchor67-9"
href="#note67-9"><span class="fnanchor">67</span></a> “although the
<em>partial</em> waves, produced by the particles comprised in the
aperture, do diffuse themselves beyond the rectilinear space, these
waves do not <em>concur</em> anywhere except in front of the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page87">87</a></span> aperture.” He rightly
considers this observation as of the most essential value. “This,” he
says, “was not known by those who began to consider the waves of
light, among whom are Mr. Hooke in his <i>Micrography</i>, and Father
Pardies; who, in a treatise of which he showed me a part, and which he
did not live to finish, had undertaken to prove, by these waves, the
effects of reflection and refraction. But the principal foundation,
which consists in the remark I have just made, was wanting in his
demonstrations.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note67-9"
href="#fnanchor67-9">67</a></span> <i>Tracts on Optics</i>, p.
209.</div>
<p>By the help of this view, Huyghens gave a perfectly satisfactory
and correct explanation of the laws of reflection and refraction; and
he also applied the same theory, as we have seen, to the double
refraction of Iceland spar with great sagacity and success. He
conceived that in this crystal, besides the spherical waves, there
might be others of a spheroidal form, the axis of the spheroid being
symmetrically disposed with regard to the faces of the rhombohedron,
for to these faces the optical phenomena are symmetrically related. He
found<a id="fnanchor68-9" href="#note68-9"><span
class="fnanchor">68</span></a> that the position of the refracted ray,
determined by such spheroidal undulations, would give an oblique
refraction, which would coincide in its laws with the refraction
observed in Iceland spar; and, as we have <a
href="#v2page70">stated</a>, this coincidence was long after fully
confirmed by other observers.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note68-9"
href="#fnanchor68-9">68</a></span> <i>Tracts on Optics</i>, 237.</div>
<p>Since Huyghens, at this early period, expounded the undulatory
theory with so much distinctness, and applied it with so much skill,
it may be asked why we do not hold him up as the great Author of the
induction of undulations of light;&#8212;the person who marks the
epoch of the theory? To this we reply, that though Huyghens discovered
strong presumptions in favor of the undulatory theory, it was not
<em>established</em> till a later era, when the fringes of shadows,
rightly understood, made the waves visible, and when the hypothesis
which had been assumed to account for double refraction, was found to
contain also an explanation of polarization. It is <em>then</em> that
this theory of light assumes its commanding form; and the persons who
gave it this form, we must make the great names of our narrative;
without, however, denying the genius and merit of Huyghens, who is,
undoubtedly, the leading character in the prelude to the
discovery.</p>
<p id="undulatory">The undulatory theory, from this time to our own,
was unfortunate in its career. It was by no means destitute of
defenders, but these were not experimenters; and none of them thought
of applying it to <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page88">88</a></span>
Grimaldi’s experiments on fringes, of which we have <a
href="#v2page79">spoken</a> a little while ago. And the great
authority of the period, Newton, adopted the opposite hypothesis, that
of emission, and gave it a currency among his followers which kept
down the sounder theory for above a century.</p>
<p>Newton’s first disposition appears to have been by no means averse
to the assumption of an ether as the vehicle of luminiferous
undulations. When Hooke brought against his prismatic analysis of
light some objections, founded on his own hypothetical notions,
Newton, in his reply, said,<a id="fnanchor69-9" href="#note69-9"><span
class="fnanchor">69</span></a> “The hypothesis has a much greater
affinity with his own hypothesis than he seems to be aware of; the
vibrations of the ether being as useful and necessary in this as in
his.” This was in 1672; and we might produce, from Newton’s writing,
passages of the same kind, of a much later date. Indeed it would seem
that, to the last, Newton considered the assumption of an ether as
highly probable, and its vibrations important parts of the phenomena
of light; but he also introduced into his system the hypothesis of
emission, and having followed this hypothesis into mathematical
detail, while he has left all that concerns the ether in the form of
queries and conjectures, the emission theory has naturally been
treated as the leading part of his optical doctrines.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note69-9"
href="#fnanchor69-9">69</a></span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> vii.
5087.</div>
<p>The principal propositions of the <i>Principia</i> which bear upon
the question of optical theory are those of the fourteenth Section of
the first Book,<a id="fnanchor70-9" href="#note70-9"><span
class="fnanchor">70</span></a> in which the law of the sines in
refraction is proved on the hypothesis that the particles of bodies
act on light only at very small distances; and the proposition of the
eighth Section of the second Book;<a id="fnanchor71-9"
href="#note71-9"><span class="fnanchor">71</span></a> in which it is
pretended to be demonstrated that the motion propagated in a fluid
must diverge when it has passed through an aperture. The former
proposition shows that the law of refraction, an optical truth which
mainly affected the choice of a theory, (for about reflection there is
no difficulty on any mechanical hypothesis,) follows from the theory
of emission: the latter proposition was intended to prove the
inadmissibility of the rival hypothesis, that of undulations. As to
the former point,&#8212;the hypothetical explanation of refraction, on
the assumptions there made,&#8212;the conclusion is quite
satisfactory; but the reasoning in the latter case, (respecting the
propagation of undulations,) is certainly inconclusive and vague; and
something better might the more reasonably have been expected, since
Huyghens had at least <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page89">89</a></span> endeavored to prove the opposite
proposition. But supposing we leave these properties, the rectilinear
course, the reflection, and the refraction of light, as problems in
which neither theory has a decided advantage, what is the next
material point? The colors of thin plates. Now, how does Newton’s
theory explain these? By a new and special supposition;&#8212;that of
<i>fits of easy transmission and reflection</i>: a supposition which,
though it truly expresses these facts, is not borne out by any other
phenomena. But, passing over this, when we come to the peculiar laws
of polarization in Iceland spar, how does Newton’s meet this? Again by
a special and new supposition;&#8212;that the rays of light have
<i>sides</i>. Thus we find no fresh evidence in favor of the emission
hypothesis springing out of the fresh demands made upon it. It may be
urged, in reply, that the same is true of the undulatory theory; and
it must be allowed that, at the time of which we now speak, its
superiority in this respect was not manifested; though Hooke, as we
have <a href="#v2page86">seen</a>, had caught a glimpse of the
explanation, which this theory supplies, of the colors of thin
plates.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note70-9"
href="#fnanchor70-9">70</a></span>  <i>Principia</i>, Prop. 94, <i>et
seq.</i></div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note71-9"
href="#fnanchor71-9">71</a></span> Ib. Prop. 42.</div>
<p>At a later period, Newton certainly seems to have been strongly
disinclined to believe light to consist in undulations merely. “Are
not,” he says, in Question twenty-eight of the <i>Opticks</i>, “all
hypotheses erroneous, in which light is supposed to consist in
pression or motion propagated through a fluid medium?” The arguments
which most weighed with him to produce this conviction, appear to have
been the one already mentioned,&#8212;that, on the undulatory
hypothesis, undulations passing through an aperture would be diffused;
and again,&#8212;his conviction, that the properties of light,
developed in various optical phenomena, “depend not upon new
modifications, but upon the original and unchangeable properties of
the rays.” (Question twenty-seven.)</p>
<p>But yet, even in this state of his views, he was very far from
abandoning the machinery of vibrations altogether. He is disposed to
use such machinery to produce his “fits of easy transmission.” In his
seventeenth Query, he says,<a id="fnanchor72-9" href="#note72-9"><span
class="fnanchor">72</span></a> “when a ray of light falls upon the
surface of any pellucid body, and is there refracted or reflected; may
not waves of vibrations or tremors be thereby excited in the
refracting or reflecting medium at the point of incidence? . . . . and
do not these vibrations overtake the rays of light, and by overtaking
them successively, do they not put them into the fits of easy
reflection and easy <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page90">90</a></span> transmission described above?” Several of
the other queries imply the same persuasion, of the necessity for the
assumption of an ether and its vibrations. And it might have been
asked, whether any good reason could be given for the hypothesis of an
ether as a <em>part</em> of the mechanism of light, which would not be
equally valid in favor of this being the <em>whole</em> of the
mechanism, especially if it could be shown that nothing more was
wanted to produce the results.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note72-9"
href="#fnanchor72-9">72</a></span> <i>Opticks</i>, p. 322.</div>
<p>The emission theory was, however, embraced in the most strenuous
manner by the disciples of Newton. That propositions existed in the
<i>Principia</i> which proceeded on this hypothesis, was, with many of
these persons, ground enough for adopting the doctrine; and it had
also the advantage of being more ready of conception, for though the
propagation of a wave is not very difficult to conceive, at least by a
mathematician, the motion of a particle is still easier.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the undulation theory was maintained by no less
a person than Euler; and the war between the two opinions was carried
on with great earnestness. The arguments on one side and on the other
soon became trite and familiar, for no person explained any new class
of facts by either theory. Thus it was urged by Euler against the
system of emission,<a id="fnanchor73-9" href="#note73-9"><span
class="fnanchor">73</span></a>&#8212;that the perpetual emanation of
light from the sun must have diminished the mass;&#8212;that the
stream of matter thus constantly flowing must affect the motions of
the planets and comets; that the rays must disturb each
other;&#8212;that the passage of light through transparent bodies is,
on this system, inconceivable: all such arguments were answered by
representations of the exceeding minuteness and velocity of the matter
of light. On the other hand, there was urged against the theory of
waves, the favorite Newtonian argument, that on this theory the light
passing through an aperture ought to be diffused, as sound is. It is
curious that Euler does not make to this argument the reply which
Huyghens had made before. The fact really was, that he was not aware
of the true ground of the difference of the result in the cases of
sound and light; namely, that any ordinary aperture bears an immense
ratio to the length of an undulation of light, but does not bear a
very great ratio to the length of an undulation of sound. The
demonstrable consequence of this difference is, that light darts
through such an orifice in straight rays, while sound is diffused in
all directions. Euler, not perceiving this difference, rested his
answer mainly upon a circumstance by no means <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page91">91</a></span> unimportant, that the partitions usually
employed are not impermeable to sound, as opake bodies are to light.
He observes that the sound does not all come through the aperture; for
we hear, though the aperture be stopped. These were the main original
points of attack and defence, and they continued nearly the same for
the whole of the last century; the same difficulties were over and
over again proposed, and the same solutions given, much in the manner
of the disputations of the schoolmen of the middle ages.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note73-9"
href="#fnanchor73-9">73</a></span> Fischer, iv. 449.</div>
<p>The struggle being thus apparently balanced, the scale was
naturally turned by the general ascendancy of the Newtonian doctrines:
and the emission theory was the one most generally adopted. It was
still more firmly established, in consequence of the turn generally
taken by the scientific activity of the latter half of the eighteenth
century: for while nothing was added to our knowledge of optical laws,
the chemical effects of light were studied to a considerable extent by
various inquirers;<a id="fnanchor74-9" href="#note74-9"><span
class="fnanchor">74</span></a> and the opinions at which these persons
arrived, they found that they could express most readily, in
consistency with the reigning chemical views, by assuming the
materiality of light. It is, however, clear, that no reasonings of the
inevitably vague and doubtful character which belong to these portions
of chemistry, ought to be allowed to interfere with the steady and
regular progress of induction and generalization, founded on relations
of space and number, by which procedure the mechanical sciences are
formed. We reject, therefore, all these chemical speculations, as
belonging to other subjects; and consider the history of optical
theory as a blank, till we arrive at some very different events, of
which we have now to speak.</p>

<span class="sc">Epoch of Young and Fresnel.</span></h3>
<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Introduction.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> man whose name must occupy
the most distinguished place in the history of Physical Optics, in
consequence of what he did in reviving and establishing the undulatory
theory of light, is Dr. Thomas Young. He was born in 1773, at
Milverton in Somersetshire, of Quaker parents; and after
distinguishing himself during youth by the variety and accuracy of his
attainments, he settled in London as a physician in 1801; but
continued to give much of his attention to general science. His
optical theory, for a long time, made few proselytes; and several
years afterwards, Auguste Fresnel, an eminent French mathematician, an
engineer officer, took up similar views, proved their truth, and
traced their consequences, by a series of labors almost independent of
those of Dr. Young. It was not till the theory was thus re-echoed from
another land, that it was able to take any strong hold on the
attention of the countrymen of its earlier promulgator.</p>
<p>The theory of undulations, like that of universal gravitation, may
be divided into several successive steps of generalization. In both
cases, all these steps were made by the same persons; but there is
this difference:&#8212;all the parts of the law of universal
gravitation were worked out in one burst of inspiration by its author,
and published at one time;&#8212;in the doctrine of light, on the
other hand, the different steps of the advance were made and published
at separate times, with intervals between. We see the theory in a
narrower form, and in detached portions, before the widest
generalizations and principles of unity are reached; we see the
authors struggling with the difficulties before we see them
successful. They appear to us as men like ourselves, liable to
perplexity and failure, instead of coming before us, as Newton does in
the history of Physical Astronomy, as the irresistible and almost
supernatural hero of a philosophical romance. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page93">93</a></span></p>
<p>The main subdivisions of the great advance in physical optics, of
which we have now to give an account, are the following:&#8212;</p>
<p>1. The explanation of the <i>periodical colors</i> of thin plates,
thick plates, fringed shadows, striated surfaces, and other phenomena
of the same kind, by means of the doctrine of the <i>interference</i>
of undulations.</p>
<p>2. The explanation of the phenomena of <i>double refraction</i> by
the propagation of undulations in a medium of which the optical
<i>elasticity</i> is different in different directions.</p>
<p>3. The conception of <i>polarization</i> as the result of the
vibrations being <i>transverse</i>; and the consequent explanation of
the production of polarization, and the necessary connexion between
polarization and double refraction, on mechanical principles.</p>
<p>4. The explanation of the phenomena of <i>dipolarization</i>, by
means of the interference of the <i>resolved parts</i> of the
vibrations after double refraction.</p>
<p>The history of each of these discoveries will be given separately
to a certain extent; by which means the force of proof arising from
their combination will be more apparent.</p>
<h4 id="b9-11-2"><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Explanation of the
Periodical Colors of Thin Plates and Shadows by the Undulatory
Theory.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> explanation of periodical
colors by the principle of interference of vibrations, was the first
step which Young made in his confirmation of the undulatory theory. In
a paper on Sound and Light, dated Emmanuel College, Cambridge, 9th
July, 1799, and read before the Royal Society in January following, he
appears to incline strongly to the Huyghenian theory; not however
offering any new facts or calculations in its favor, but pointing out
the great difficulties of the Newtonian hypothesis. But in a paper
read before the Royal Society, November 12, 1801, he says, “A further
consideration of the colors of thin plates has converted that
prepossession which I before entertained for the undulatory theory of
light, into a very strong conviction of its truth and efficiency; a
conviction which has since been most strikingly confirmed by an
analysis of the colors of <i>striated surfaces</i>.” He here states the
general principle of interferences in the form of a proposition.
(Prop. viii.) “When two undulations from different origins coincide
either perfectly or very nearly in direction, their joint effect is a
combination of the motions belonging to them.” He explains, by the
help of this proposition, the colors which were observed in Coventry’s
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page94">94</a></span> micrometers, in
which instrument lines were drawn on glass at a distance of <span
style="font-size: 80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>500</sub></span>th of
an inch. The interference of the undulations of the rays reflected
from the two sides of these fine lines, produced periodical colors. In
the same manner, he accounts for the colors of thin plates, by the
interference of the light partially reflected from the two surfaces of
the plates. We have <a href="#v2page86">already</a> seen that Hooke
had long before suggested the same explanation; and Young says at the
end of his paper, “It was not till I had satisfied myself respecting
all these phenomena, that I found in Hooke’s <i>Micrographia</i> a
passage which might have led me earlier to a similar opinion.” He also
quotes from Newton many passages which assume the existence of an
ether; of which, as we have <a href="#v2page89">already</a> seen,
Newton suggests the necessity in these very phenomena, though he would
apply it in combination with the emission of material light. In July,
1802, Young explained, on the same principle, some facts in indistinct
vision, and other similar appearances. And in 1803,<a
id="fnanchor75-9" href="#note75-9"><span
class="fnanchor">75</span></a> he speaks more positively still. “In
making,” he says, “some experiments on the fringes of colors
accompanying shadows, I have found so simple and so demonstrative a
proof of the general law of interference of two portions of light,
which I have already endeavored to establish, that I think it right to
lay before the Royal Society a short statement of the facts which
appear to me to be thus decisive.” The two papers just mentioned
certainly ought to have convinced all scientific men of the truth of
the doctrine thus urged; for the number and exactness of the
explanations is very remarkable. They include the colored fringes
which are seen with the shadows of fibres; the colors produced by a
dew between two pieces of glass, which, according to the theory,
should appear when the thickness of the plate is <em>six</em> times
that of thin plates, and which do so; the changes resulting from the
employment of other fluids than water; the effect of inclining the
plates; also the fringes and bands which accompany shadows, the
phenomena observed by Grimaldi, Newton, Maraldi, and others, and
hitherto never at all reduced to rule. Young observes, very justly,
“whatever may be thought of the theory, we have got a simple and
general law” of the phenomena. He moreover calculated the length of an
undulation from the measurements of fringes of shadows, as he had done
before from the colors of thin plates; and found a very close
accordance of the results of the various cases with one another.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note75-9"
href="#fnanchor75-9">75</a></span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> Memoir, read
Nov. 24.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page95">95</a></span> There is one
difficulty, and one inaccuracy, in Young’s views at this period, which
it may be proper to note. The difficulty was, that he found it
necessary to suppose that light, when reflected at a rarer medium, is
retarded by half an undulation. This assumption, though often urged at
a later period as an argument against the theory, was fully justified
as the mechanical principles of the subject were unfolded; and the
necessity of it was clear to Young from the first. On the strength of
this, says he, “I ventured to predict, that if the reflections were of
the same kind, made at the surfaces of a thin plate, of a density
intermediate between the densities of the mediums surrounding it, the
central spot would be white; and I have now the pleasure of stating,
that I have fully verified this prediction by interposing a drop of
oil of sassafras between a prism of flint-glass and a lens of
crown-glass.”</p>
<p>The inaccuracy of his calculations consisted in his considering the
external fringe of shadows to be produced by the interference of a ray
<em>reflected</em> from the <em>edge</em> of the object, with a ray
which passes clear of it; instead of supposing <em>all the parts</em>
of the wave of light to corroborate or interfere with one another. The
mathematical treatment of the question on the latter hypothesis was by
no means easy. Young was a mathematician of considerable power in the
solution of the problems which came before him: though his methods
possessed none of the analytical elegance which, in his time, had
become general in France. But it does not appear that he ever solved
the problem of undulations as applied to fringes, with its true
conditions. He did, however, rectify his conceptions of the nature of
the interference; and we may add, that the numerical error of the
consequences of the defective hypothesis is not such as to prevent
their confirming the undulatory theory.<a id="fnanchor76-9"
href="#note76-9"><span class="fnanchor">76</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note76-9"
href="#fnanchor76-9">76</a></span> I may mention, in addition to the
applications which Young made of the principle of interferences, his
<i>Eriometer</i>, an instrument invented for the purpose of measuring
the thickness of the fibres of wood; and the explanation of the
supernumerary bands of the rainbow. These explanations involve
calculations founded on the length of an undulation of light, and were
confirmed by experiment, as far as experiment went.</div>
<p>But though this theory was thus so powerfully recommended by
experiment and calculation, it met with little favor in the scientific
world. Perhaps this will be in some measure accounted for, when we
come, in the next <a href="#b9-12">chapter</a>, to speak of the mode
of its reception by <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page96">96</a></span> the supposed judges of science and
letters. Its author went on laboring at the completion and application
of the theory in other parts of the subject; but his extraordinary
success in unravelling the complex phenomena of which we have been
speaking, appears to have excited none of the notice and admiration
which properly belonged to it, till Fresnel’s Memoir <i>On
Diffraction</i> was delivered to the Institute, in October, 1815.</p>
<p>MM. Arago and Poinsot were commissioned to make a report upon this
Memoir; and the former of these philosophers threw himself upon the
subject with a zeal and intelligence which peculiarly belonged to him.
He verified the laws announced by Fresnel: “laws,” he says, “which
appear to be destined to make an epoch in science.” He then cast a
rapid glance at the history of the subject, and recognized, at once,
the place which Young occupied in it. Grimaldi, Newton, Maraldi, he
states, had observed the facts, and tried in vain to reduce them to
rule or cause. “Such<a id="fnanchor77-9" href="#note77-9"><span
class="fnanchor">77</span></a> was the state of our knowledge on this
difficult question, when Dr. Thomas Young made the very remarkable
experiment which is described in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>
for 1803;” namely, that to obliterate all the bands within the shadow,
we need only stop the ray which is going to graze, or has grazed, one
border of the object. To this, Arago added the important observation,
that the same obliteration takes place, if we stop the ray, with a
transparent plate; except the plate be very thin, in which case the
bands are displaced, and not extinguished. “Fresnel,” says he,
“guessed the effect which a thin plate would produce, when I had told
him of the effect of a thick glass.” Fresnel himself declares<a
id="fnanchor78-9" href="#note78-9"><span
class="fnanchor">78</span></a> that he was not, at the time, aware of
Young’s previous labors. After stating nearly the same reasonings
concerning fringes which Young had put forward in 1801, he adds, “it
is therefore the meeting, the actual crossing of the rays, which
produces the fringes. This consequence, which is only, so to speak,
the translation of the phenomena, seems to me entirely opposed to the
hypothesis of emission, and confirms the system which makes light
consist in the vibrations of a peculiar fluid.” And thus the Principle
of Interferences, and the theory of undulations, so far as that
principle depends upon the theory, was a second time established by
Fresnel in France, fourteen years after it had been discovered, fully
proved, and repeatedly published by Young in England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page97">97</a></span> In this Memoir
of Fresnel’s, he takes very nearly the same course as Young had done;
considering the interference of the direct light with that reflected
at the edge, as the cause of the external fringes; and he observes,
that in this reflection it is necessary to suppose half an undulation
lost: but a few years later, he considered the propagation of
undulations in a more true and general manner, and obtained the
solution of this difficulty of the half-undulation. His more complete
Memoir on <i>Diffraction</i> was delivered to the Institute of France,
July 29, 1818; and had the prize awarded it in 1819:<a
id="fnanchor79-9" href="#note79-9"><span
class="fnanchor">79</span></a> but by the delays which at that period
occurred in the publication of the <i>Parisian Academical
Transactions</i>, it was not published<a id="fnanchor80-9"
href="#note80-9"><span class="fnanchor">80</span></a> till 1826, when
the theory was no longer generally doubtful or unknown in the
scientific world. In this Memoir, Fresnel observes, that we must
consider the effect of <em>every portion</em> of a wave of light upon
a distant point, and must, on this principle, find the illumination
produced by any number of such waves together. Hence, in general, the
process of integration is requisite; and though the integrals which
here offer themselves are of a new and difficult kind, he succeeded in
making the calculation for the cases in which he experimented. His
<i>Table of the Correspondences of Theory and Observation</i>,<a
id="fnanchor81-9" href="#note81-9"><span
class="fnanchor">81</span></a> is very remarkable for the closeness of
the agreement; the errors being generally less than one hundredth of
the whole, in the distances of the black bands. He justly adds, “A
more striking agreement could not be expected between experiment and
theory. If we compare the smallness of the differences with the extent
of the breadths measured; and if we remark the great variations which
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> (the distance of the object from the luminous
point and from the screen) have received in the different
observations, we shall find it difficult not to regard the integral
which has led us to these results as the faithful expression of the
law of the phenomena.”</p>

<p>A mathematical theory, applied, with this success, to a variety of
cases of very different kinds, could not now fail to take strong hold
of the attention of mathematicians; and accordingly, from this time,
the undulatory doctrine of diffraction has been generally assented to,
and the mathematical difficulties which it involves, have been duly
studied and struggled with.</p>
<p>Among the remarkable applications of the undulatory doctrine to
diffraction, we may notice those of Joseph Fraunhofer, a <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page98">98</a></span> mathematical optician
of Munich. He made a great number of experiments on the shadows
produced by small holes, and groups of small holes, very near each
other. These were published<a id="fnanchor82-9" href="#note82-9"><span
class="fnanchor">82</span></a> in his <i>New Modifications of
Light</i>, in 1823. The greater part of this Memoir is employed in
tracing the laws of phenomena of the extremely complex and splendid
appearances which he obtained; but at the conclusion he observes, “It
is remarkable that the laws of the reciprocal influence and of the
diffraction of the rays, can be deduced from the principles of the
undulatory theory: knowing the conditions, we may, by means of an
extremely simple equation, determine the extent of a luminous wave for
each of the different colors; and in every case, the calculation
corresponds with observation.” This mention of “an extremely simple
equation,” appears to imply that he employed only Young’s and
Fresnel’s earlier mode of calculating interferences, by considering
two portions of light, and not the method of integration. Both from
the late period at which they were published, and from the absence of
mathematical details, Fraunhofer’s labors had not any strong influence
on the establishment of the undulatory theory; although they are
excellent verifications of it, both from the goodness of the
observations, and the complexity and beauty of the phenomena.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note82-9"
href="#fnanchor82-9">82</a></span> In Schumacher’s <i>Astronomische
Abhandlungen</i>, in French; earlier in German.</div>
<p>We have now to consider the progress of the undulatory theory in
another of its departments, according to the division already
stated.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Explanation of Double Refraction by the
Undulatory Theory.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">We</span> have traced the history of
the undulatory theory applied to diffraction, into the period when
Young came to have Fresnel for his fellow-laborer. But in the mean
time, Young had considered the theory in its reference to other
phenomena, and especially to those of <i>double refraction</i>.</p>
<p>In this case, indeed, Huyghens’s explanation of the facts of
Iceland spar, by means of spheroidal undulations, was so complete, and
had been so fully confirmed by the measurements of Haüy and Wollaston,
that little remained to be done, except to connect the Huyghenian
hypothesis with the mechanical views belonging to the theory, and to
extend his law to other cases. The former part of this task Young
executed, by remarking that we may conceive the <em>elasticity</em> of
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page99">99</a></span> crystal, on
which the velocity of propagation of the luminiferous undulation
depends, to be different, in the direction of the crystallographic
axis, and in the direction of the planes at right angles to this axis;
and from such a difference, he deduces the existence of spheroidal
undulations. This suggestion appeared in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>
for November, 1809, in a critique upon an attempt of Laplace to
account for the same phenomena. Laplace had proposed to reduce the
double refraction of such crystals as Iceland spar, to his favorite
machinery of forces which are sensible at small distances only. The
peculiar forces which produce the effect in this case, he conceives to
emanate from the crystallographic axis: so that the velocity of light
within the crystal will depend only on the situation of the ray with
respect to this axis. But the establishment of this condition is, as
Young observes, the main difficulty of the problem. How are we to
conceive refracting forces, independent of the surface of the
refracting medium, and regulated only by a certain internal line?
Moreover, the law of force which Laplace was obliged to assume,
namely, that it varied as the square of the sine of the angle which
the ray made with the axis, could hardly be reconciled with mechanical
principles. In the critique just mentioned, Young appears to feel that
the undulatory theory, and perhaps he himself, had not received
justice at the hands of men of science; he complains that a person so
eminent in the world of science as Laplace then was, should employ his
influence in propagating error, and should disregard the extraordinary
confirmations which the Huyghenian theory had recently received.</p>
<p>The extension of this view, of the different elasticity of crystals
in different directions, to other than uniaxal crystals, was a more
complex and difficult problem. The general notion was perhaps obvious,
after what Young had done; but its application and verification
involved mathematical calculations of great generality, and required
also very exact experiments. In fact, this application was not made
till Fresnel, a pupil of the Polytechnic School, brought the resources
of the modern analysis to bear upon the problem;&#8212;till the
phenomena of dipolarized light presented the properties of biaxal
crystals in a vast variety of forms;&#8212;and till the theory
received its grand impulse by the combination of the explanation of
polarization with the explanation of double refraction. To the history
of this last-mentioned great step we now proceed. <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page100">100</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 4.&#8212;<i>Explanation of Polarization by the
Undulatory Theory.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Even</span> while the only phenomena
of <i>polarization</i> which were known were those which affect the
two images in Iceland spar, the difficulty which these facts seemed at
first to throw in the way of the undulatory theory was felt and
acknowledged by Young. Malus’s discovery of polarization by reflection
increased the difficulty, and this Young did not attempt to conceal.
In his review of the papers containing this discovery<a
id="fnanchor83-9" href="#note83-9"><span
class="fnanchor">83</span></a> he says, “The discovery related in
these papers appears to us to be by far the most important and
interesting which has been made in France concerning the properties of
light, at least since the time of Huyghens; and it is so much the more
deserving of notice, as it greatly influences the general balance of
evidence in the comparison of the undulatory and projectile theories
of the nature of light.” He then proceeds to point out the main
features in this comparison, claiming justly a great advantage for the
theory of undulations on the two points we have been considering, the
phenomena of diffraction and of double refraction. And he adds, with
reference to the embarrassment introduced by polarization, that we are
not to expect the course of scientific discovery to run smooth and
uninterrupted; but that we are to lay our account with partial
obscurity and seeming contradiction, which we may hope that time and
enlarged research will dissipate. And thus he steadfastly held, with
no blind prejudice, but with unshaken confidence, his great
philosophical trust, the fortunes of the undulatory theory. It is
here, after the difficulties of polarization had come into view, and
before their solution had been discovered, that we may place the
darkest time of the history of the theory; and at this period Young
was alone in the field.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note83-9"
href="#fnanchor83-9">83</a></span> <i>Quart. Rev.</i> May, 1810.</div>
<p>It does not appear that the light dawned upon him for some years.
In the mean time, Young found that his theory would explain
dipolarized colors; and he had the satisfaction to see Fresnel
re-discover, and M. Arago adopt, his views on diffraction. He became
engaged in friendly intercourse with the latter philosopher, who
visited him in England in 1816. On January the 12th, 1817, in writing
to this gentleman, among other remarks on the subject of optics, he
says, “I have also been reflecting on the possibility of giving an
imperfect explanation of the affection of light which constitutes
polarization, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page101">101</a></span>
without departing from the genuine doctrine of undulation.” He then
proceeds to suggest the possibility of “a <em>transverse</em>
vibration, propagated in the direction of the radius, the motions of
the particles being in a certain constant direction with respect to
that radius; and this,” he adds, “is <em>polarization</em>.” From his
further explanation of his views, it appears that he conceived the
motions of the particles to be oblique to the direction of the ray,
and not perpendicular, as the theory was afterwards framed; but still,
here was the essential condition for the explanation of the facts of
polarization,&#8212;the transverse nature of the vibrations. This idea
at once made it possible to conceive how the rays of light could have
<i>sides</i>; for the direction in which the vibration was transverse
to the ray, might be marked by peculiar properties. And after the idea
was once started, it was comparatively easy for men like Young and
Fresnel to pursue and modify it till it assumed its true and distinct
form.</p>
<p>We may judge of the difficulty of taking firmly hold of the
conception of transverse vibrations of the ether, as those which
constitute light, by observing how long the great philosophers of whom
we are speaking lingered within reach of it, before they ventured to
grasp it. Fresnel says, in 1821, “When M. Arago and I had remarked (in
1816) that two rays polarized at right angles always give the same
quantity of light by their union, I thought this might be explained by
supposing the vibrations to be transverse, and to be at right angles
when the rays are polarized at right angles. But this supposition was
so contrary to the received ideas on the nature of the vibrations of
elastic fluids,” that Fresnel hesitated to adopt it till he could
reconcile it better to his mechanical notions. “Mr. Young, more bold
in his conjectures, and less confiding in the views of geometers,
published it before me, though perhaps he thought it after me.” And M.
Arago was afterwards wont to relate<a id="fnanchor84-9"
href="#note84-9"><span class="fnanchor">84</span></a> that when he and
Fresnel had obtained their joint experimental results of the
non-interference of oppositely-polarized pencils, and when Fresnel
pointed out that transverse vibrations were the only possible
translation of this fact into the undulatory theory, he himself
protested that he had not courage to publish such a conception; and
accordingly, the second part of the Memoir was published in Fresnel’s
name alone. What renders this more remarkable is, that it occurred
when M. Arago had in his possession the very letter of Young, in which
he proposed the same suggestion.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note84-9"
href="#fnanchor84-9">84</a></span> I take the liberty of stating this
from personal knowledge.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page102">102</a></span> Young’s
first published statement of the doctrine of transverse vibrations was
given in the explanation of the phenomena of dipolarization, of which
we shall have to speak in the next <a href="#b9-11-5">Section</a>. But
the primary and immense value of this conception, as a step in the
progress of the undulatory theory, was the connexion which it
established between polarization and double refraction; for it held
forth a promise of accounting for polarization, if any conditions
could be found which might determine what was the direction of the
transverse vibrations. The analysis of these conditions is, in a great
measure, the work of Fresnel; a task performed with profound
philosophical sagacity and great mathematical skill.</p>
<p>Since the double refraction of uniaxal crystals could be explained
by undulations of the form of a spheroid, it was perhaps not difficult
to conjecture that the undulations of biaxal crystals would be
accounted for by undulations of the form of an ellipsoid, which
differs from the spheroid in having its three axes unequal, instead of
two only; and consequently has that very relation to the other, in
respect of symmetry, which the crystalline and optical phenomena have.
Or, again, instead of supposing two different degrees of elasticity in
different directions, we may suppose three such different degrees in
directions at right angles to each other. This kind of generalization
was tolerably obvious to a practised mathematician.</p>
<p>But what shall call into play all these elasticities at once, and
produce waves governed by each of them? And what shall explain the
different polarization of the rays which these separate waves carry
with them? These were difficult questions, to the solution of which
mathematical calculation had hitherto been unable to offer any
aid.</p>
<p>It was here that the conception of transverse vibrations came in,
like a beam of sunlight, to disclose the possibility of a mechanical
connexion of all these facts. If transverse vibrations, travelling
through a uniform medium, come to a medium not uniform, but
constituted so that the elasticity shall be different in different
directions, in the manner we have described, what will be the course
and condition of the waves in the second medium? Will the effects of
such waves agree with the phenomena of doubly-refracted light in
biaxal crystals? Here was a problem, striking to the mathematician for
its generality and difficulty, and of deep interest to the physical
philosopher, because the fate of a great theory depended upon its
solution.</p>
<p>The solution, obtained by great mathematical skill, was laid before
the French Institute by Fresnel in November, 1821, and was carried
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page103">103</a></span> further in two
Memoirs presented in 1822. Its import is very curious. The undulations
which, coming from a distant centre, fall upon such a medium as we
have described, are, it appears from the principles of mechanics,
propagated in a manner quite different from anything which had been
anticipated. The “surface of the waves” (that is, the surface which
would bound undulations diverging from a point), is a very complex,
yet symmetrical curve surface; which, in the case of uniaxal crystals,
resolves itself into a sphere and a spheroid; but which, in general,
forms a continuous double envelope of the central point to which it
belongs, intersecting itself and returning into itself. The directions
of the rays are determined by this curve surface in biaxal crystals,
as in uniaxal crystals they are determined by the sphere and the
spheroid; and the result is, that in biaxal crystals, <em>both</em>
rays suffer <em>extraordinary</em> refraction according to determinate
laws. And the positions of the planes of polarization of the two rays
follow from the same investigation; the plane of polarization in every
case being supposed to be that which is perpendicular to the
transverse vibrations. Now it appeared that the polarization of the
two rays, as determined by Fresnel’s theory, would be in directions,
not indeed exactly accordant with the law deduced by M. Biot from
experiment, but deviating so little from those directions, that there
could be small doubt that the empirical formula was wrong, and the
theoretical one right.</p>
<p>The theory was further confirmed by an experiment showing that, in
a biaxal crystal (topaz), neither of the rays was refracted according
to the ordinary law, though it had hitherto been supposed that one of
them was so; a natural inaccuracy, since the error was small.<a
id="fnanchor85-9" href="#note85-9"><span
class="fnanchor">85</span></a> Thus this beautiful theory corrected,
while it explained, the best of the observations which had previously
been made; and offered itself to mathematicians with an almost
irresistible power of conviction. The explanation of laws so strange
and diverse as those of double refraction and polarization, by the
same general and symmetrical theory, could not result from anything
but the truth of the theory.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note85-9"
href="#fnanchor85-9">85</a></span> <i>An. Ch.</i> xxviii. p.
264.</div>
<p>“Long,” says Fresnel,<a id="fnanchor86-9" href="#note86-9"><span
class="fnanchor">86</span></a> “before I had conceived this theory, I
had convinced myself by a pure contemplation of the facts, that it was
not possible to discover the true explanation of double refraction,
without explaining, at the same time, the phenomena of polarization,
which always goes along with it; and accordingly, it was after having
found <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page104">104</a></span> what mode
of vibration constituted polarization, that I caught sight of the
mechanical causes of double refraction.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note86-9"
href="#fnanchor86-9">86</a></span> <i>Sur la Double Réf., Mém.
Inst.</i> 1826, p. 174.</div>
<p>Having thus got possession of the principle of the mechanism of
polarization, Fresnel proceeded to apply it to the other cases of
polarized light, with a rapidity and sagacity which reminds us of the
spirit in which Newton traced out the consequences of the principle of
universal gravitation. In the execution of his task, indeed, Fresnel
was forced upon several precarious assumptions, which make, even yet,
a wide difference between the theory of gravitation and that of light.
But the mode in which these were confirmed by experiment, compels us
to admire the happy apparent boldness of the calculator.</p>
<p>The subject of <i>polarization by reflection</i> was one of those
which seemed most untractable; but, by means of various artifices and
conjectures, it was broken up and subdued. Fresnel began with the
simplest case, the reflection of light polarized in the plane of
reflection; which he solved by means of the laws of collision of
elastic bodies. He then took the reflection of light polarized
perpendicularly to this plane; and here, adding to the general
mechanical principles a hypothetical assumption, that the
communication of the resolved motion parallel to the refracting
surface, takes place according to the laws of elastic bodies, he
obtains his formula. These results were capable of comparison with
experiment; and the comparison, when made by M. Arago, confirmed the
formulæ. They accounted, too, for Sir D. Brewster’s law concerning the
polarizing angle (see <a href="#v2page76">Chap. vi.</a>); and this
could not but be looked upon as a striking evidence of their having
some real foundation. Another artifice which MM. Fresnel and Arago
employed, in order to trace the effect of reflection upon common
light, was to use a ray polarized in a plane making half a right angle
with the plane of reflection; for the quantities of the oppositely<a
id="fnanchor87-9" href="#note87-9"><span
class="fnanchor">87</span></a> polarized light in such an incident ray
are equal, as they are in common light; but the relative quantities of
the oppositely polarized light in the reflected ray are indicated by
the new plane of polarization; and thus these relative quantities
become known for the case of common light. The results thus obtained
were also confirmed by facts; and in this manner, all that was
doubtful in the process of Fresnel’s reasoning, seemed to be
authorized by its application to real cases.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note87-9"
href="#fnanchor87-9">87</a></span> It will be recollected all along,
that <em>oppositely</em> polarized rays are those which are polarized
in two planes <em>perpendicular</em> to each other. See above, <a
href="#v2page74">chap. vi.</a></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page105">105</a></span> These
investigations were published<a id="fnanchor88-9"
href="#note88-9"><span class="fnanchor">88</span></a> in 1821. In
succeeding years, Fresnel undertook to extend the application of his
formulæ to a case in which they ceased to have a meaning, or, in the
language of mathematicians, became <i>imaginary</i>; namely, to the
case of internal reflection at the surface of a transparent body. It
may seem strange to those who are not mathematicians, but it is
undoubtedly true, that in many cases in which the solution of a
problem directs impossible arithmetical or algebraical operations to
be performed, these directions may be so interpreted as to point out a
true solution of the question. Such an interpretation Fresnel
attempted<a id="fnanchor89-9" href="#note89-9"><span
class="fnanchor">89</span></a> in the case of which we now speak; and
the result at which he arrived was, that the reflection of light
through a rhomb of glass of a certain form (since called <i>Fresnel’s
rhomb</i>, would produce a polarization of a kind altogether different
from those which his theory had previously considered, namely, that
kind which we have spoken of as <i>circular polarization</i>. The
complete confirmation of this curious and unexpected result by trial,
is another of the extraordinary triumphs which have distinguished the
history of the theory at every step since the commencement of
Fresnel’s labors.</p>

<p>But anything further which has been done in this way, may be
treated of more properly in relating the verification of the theory.
And we have still to speak of the most numerous and varied class of
facts to which rival theories of light were applied, and of the
establishment of the undulatory doctrine in reference to that
department; I mean the phenomena of depolarized, or rather, as I have
<a href="#b9-9">already</a> said, <em>di</em>polarized light.</p>
<h4 id="b9-11-5"><i>Sect.</i> 5.&#8212;<i>Explanation of
Dipolarization by the Undulatory Theory.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">When</span> Arago, in 1811, had
discovered the colors produced by polarized light passing through
certain crystals,<a id="fnanchor90-9" href="#note90-9"><span
class="fnanchor">90</span></a> it was natural that attempts should be
made to reduce them to theory. M. Biot, animated by the success of
Malus in detecting the laws of double refraction, and Young, knowing
the resources of his own theory, were the first persons to enter upon
this undertaking. M. Biot’s theory, though in the end displaced by its
rival, is well worth notice in the history of the subject. It was what
he called the doctrine of <i>moveable polarization</i>. He conceived
that when the molecules of light pass through <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page106">106</a></span> thin crystalline plates, the plane of
polarization undergoes an oscillation which carries it backwards and
forwards through a certain angle, namely, twice the angle contained
between the original plane of polarization and the principal section
of the crystal. The intervals which this oscillation occupies are
lengths of the path of the ray, very minute, and different for
different colors, like Newton’s fits of easy transmission; on which
model, indeed, the new theory was evidently framed.<a
id="fnanchor91-9" href="#note91-9"><span
class="fnanchor">91</span></a> The colors produced in the phenomena of
dipolarization really do depend, in a periodical manner, on the length
of the path of the light through the crystal, and a theory such as M.
Biot’s was capable of being modified, and was modified, so as to
include the leading features of the facts as then known; but many of
its conditions being founded on special circumstances in the
experiments, and not on the real conditions of nature, there were in
it several incongruities, as well as the general defect of its being
an arbitrary and unconnected hypothesis.</p>

<p>Young’s mode of accounting for the brilliant phenomena of
dipolarization appeared in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> for 1814. After
noticing the discoveries of MM. Arago, Brewster, and Biot, he adds,
“We have no doubt that the surprise of these gentlemen will be as
great as our own satisfaction in finding that they are perfectly
reducible, like other causes of recurrent colors, to the general laws
of the interference of light which have been established in this
country;” giving a reference to his former statements. The results are
then explained by the interference of the ordinary and extraordinary
ray. But, as M. Arago properly observes, in his account of this
matter,<a id="fnanchor92-9" href="#note92-9"><span
class="fnanchor">92</span></a> “It must, however, be added that Dr.
Young had not explained either in what circumstances the interference
of the rays can take place, nor why we see no colors unless the
crystallized plates are exposed to light previously polarized.” The
explanation of these circumstances depends on the laws of interference
of polarized light which MM. Arago and Fresnel established in 1816.
They then proved, by direct experiment, that when polarized light was
treated so as to bring into view the most marked phenomena of
interference, namely, the bands of shadows; pencils of light which
have a common origin, and which are polarized in the parallel planes,
interfere completely, while those which are <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page107">107</a></span> polarized in <em>opposite</em> (that is,
perpendicular,) planes do not interfere at all.<a id="fnanchor93-9"
href="#note93-9"><span class="fnanchor">93</span></a> Taking these
principles into the account, Fresnel explained very completely, by
means of the interference of undulations, all the circumstances of
colors produced by crystallized plates; showing the necessity of the
<i>polarization</i> in the first instance; the <i>dipolarizing</i>
effect of the crystal; and the office of the <i>analysing plate</i>,
by which certain portions of each of the two rays in the crystal are
made to interfere and produce color. This he did, as he says,<a
id="fnanchor94-9" href="#note94-9"><span
class="fnanchor">94</span></a> without being aware, till Arago told
him, that Young had, to some extent, anticipated him.</p>

<p>When we look at the history of the emission-theory of light, we see
exactly what we may consider as the natural course of things in the
career of a false theory. Such a theory may, to a certain extent,
explain the phenomena which it was at first contrived to meet; but
every new class of facts requires a new supposition,&#8212;an addition
to the machinery; and as observation goes on, these incoherent
appendages accumulate, till they overwhelm and upset the original
frame-work. Such was the history of the hypothesis of solid epicycles;
such has been the history of the hypothesis of the material emission
of light. In its simple form, it explained reflection and refraction;
but the colors of thin plates added to it the hypothesis of fits of
easy transmission and reflection; the phenomena of diffraction further
invested the particles with complex hypothetical laws of attraction
and repulsion; polarization gave them sides; double refraction
subjected them to peculiar forces emanating from the axes of crystals;
finally, dipolarization loaded them with the complex and unconnected
contrivance of moveable polarization; and even when all this had been
assumed, additional mechanism was wanting. There is here no unexpected
success, no happy coincidence, no convergence of principles from
remote quarters; the philosopher builds the machine, but its parts do
not fit; they hold together only while he presses them: this is not
the character of truth.</p>
<p>In the undulatory theory, on the other hand, all tends to unity and
simplicity. We explain reflection and refraction by undulations; when
we come to thin plates, the requisite “fits” are already involved in
our fundamental hypothesis, for they are the length of an undulation;
the phenomena of diffraction also require such intervals; and the
intervals thus required agree exactly with the others in magnitude,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page108">108</a></span> so that no new
property is needed. Polarization for a moment checks us; but not long;
for the direction of our vibrations is hitherto arbitrary;&#8212;we
allow polarization to decide it. Having done this for the sake of
polarization, we find that it also answers an entirely different
purpose, that of giving the law of double refraction. Truth may give
rise to such a coincidence; falsehood cannot. But the phenomena become
more numerous, more various, more strange; no matter: the Theory is
equal to them all. It makes not a single new physical hypothesis; but
out of its original stock of principles it educes the counterpart of
all that observation shows. It accounts for, explains, simplifies, the
most entangled cases; corrects known laws and facts; predicts and
discloses unknown ones; becomes the guide of its former teacher,
Observation; and, enlightened by mechanical conceptions, acquires an
insight which pierces through shape and color to force and cause.</p>
<p>We thus reach the philosophical <em>moral</em> of this history, so
important in reference to our purpose; and here we shall close the
account of the discovery and promulgation of the undulatory theory.
Any further steps in its development and extension, may with propriety
be noticed in the ensuing chapters, respecting its reception and
verification.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [In the <i>Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences</i>, B.
xi. ch. iii. Sect. 11, I have spoken of the <i>Consilience of
Inductions</i> as one of the characters of scientific truth. We have
several striking instances of such consilience in the history of the
undulatory theory. The phenomena of fringes of shadows and colored
bands in crystals <em>jump together</em> in the Theory of Vibrations.
The phenomena of polarization and double refraction <em>jump
together</em> in the Theory of Crystalline Vibrations. The phenomena
of polarization and of the interference of polarized rays <em>jump
together</em> in the Theory of Transverse Vibrations.</p>
<p>The proof of what is above said of the undulatory theory is
contained in the previous history. This theory has “accounted for,
explained, and simplified the most entangled cases;” as the cases of
fringes of shadows; shadows of gratings; colored bands in biaxal
crystals, and in quartz. There are no optical phenomena more entangled
than these. It has “corrected experimental laws,” as in the case of M.
Biot’s law of the direction of polarization in biaxal crystals. It has
done this, “without making any new physical hypothesis;” for the
transverse direction of vibrations, the different optical elasticities
of crystals in different directions, and (if it be adopted) the
hypothesis of finite <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page109">109</a></span> intervals of the particles (see <a
href="#b9-10">chap. x.</a> and hereafter, <a href="#b9-13">chap.
xiii.</a>), are only limitations of what was indefinite in the earlier
form of the hypothesis. And so far as the properties of visible
radiant light are concerned, I do not think it at all too much to say,
as M. Schwerd has said, that “the undulation theory accounts for the
phenomena as completely as the theory of gravitation does for the
facts of the solar system.”</p>
<p>This we might say, even if some facts were not yet fully explained;
for there were till very lately, if there are not still, such
unexplained facts with regard to the theory of gravitation, presented
to us by the solar system. With regard to the undulatory theory, these
exceptions are, I think, disappearing quite as rapidly and as
completely as in the case of gravitation. It is to be observed that no
presumption against the theory can with any show of reason be
collected from the cases in which classes of phenomena remain
unexplained, the theory having never been applied to them by any
mathematician capable of tracing its results correctly. The history of
the theory of gravitation may show us abundantly how necessary it is
to bear in mind this caution; and the results of the undulatory theory
cannot be traced without great mathematical skill and great labor, any
more than those of gravitation.</p>
<p>This remark applies to such cases as that of the <i>transverse
fringes of grooved surfaces</i>. The general phenomena of these cases
are perfectly explained by the theory. But there is an interruption in
the light in an oblique direction, which has not yet been explained;
but looking at what has been done in other cases, it is impossible to
doubt that this phenomenon depends upon the results of certain
integrations, and would be explained if these were rightly
performed.</p>
<p>The phenomena of <i>crystallized surfaces</i>, and especially their
effects upon the plane of polarization, were examined by Sir D.
Brewster, and laws of the phenomena made out by him with his usual
skill and sagacity. For a time these were unexplained by the theory.
But recently Mr. Mac Cullagh has traced the consequences of the theory
in this case,<a id="fnanchor95-9" href="#note95-9"><span
class="fnanchor">95</span></a> and obtained a law which represents
with much exactness, Sir D. Brewster’s observation.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note95-9"
href="#fnanchor95-9">95</a></span> Prof. Lloyd’s <i>Report, Brit.
Assoc.</i> 1834, p. 374.</div>
<p>The phenomena which Sir D. Brewster, in 1837, called a <i>new
property of light</i>, (certain appearances of the spectrum when the
pupil of the eye is half covered with a thin glass or crystal,) have
been explained by Mr. Airy in the <i>Phil. Trans.</i> for 1840.</p>
<p>Mr. Airy’s explanation of the phenomena termed by Sir D. <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page110">110</a></span> Brewster a <i>new
property of light</i>, is completed in the <i>Philosophical
Magazine</i> for November, 1846. It is there shown that a dependence
of the breadth of the bands upon the aperture of the pupil, which had
been supposed to result from the theory, and which does not appear in
the experiment, did really result from certain limited conditions of
the hypothesis, which conditions do not belong to the experiment; and
that when the problem is solved without those limitations, the
discrepance of theory and observation vanishes; so that, as Mr. Airy
says, “this very remarkable experiment, which long appeared
inexplicable, seems destined to give one of the strongest
confirmations to the Undulatory Theory.”</p>
<p>I may remark also that there is no force in the objection which has
been urged against the admirers of the undulatory theory, that by the
fulness of their assent to it, they discourage further researches
which may contradict or confirm it. We must, in this point of view
also, look at the course of the theory of gravitation and its results.
The acceptance of that theory did not prevent mathematicians and
observers from attending to the apparent exceptions, but on the
contrary, stimulated them to calculate and to observe with additional
zeal, and still does so. The acceleration of the Moon, the mutual
disturbances of Jupiter and Saturn, the motions of Jupiter’s
Satellites, the effect of the Earth’s oblateness on the Moon’s motion,
the motions of the Moon about her own centre, and many other
phenomena, were studied with the greater attention, <em>because</em>
the general theory was deemed so convincing: and the same cause makes
the remaining exceptions objects of intense interest to astronomers
and mathematicians. The mathematicians and optical experimenters who
accept the undulatory theory, will of course follow out their
conviction in the same manner. Accordingly, this has been done and is
still doing, as in Mr. Airy’s mathematical investigation of the effect
of an annular aperture; Mr. Earnshaw’s, of the effect of a triangular
aperture; Mr. Talbot’s explanation of the effect of interposing a film
of mica between a part of the pupil and the pure spectrum, so nearly
approaching to the phenomena which have been spoken of as a new
Polarity of Light; besides other labors of eminent mathematicians,
elsewhere mentioned in these pages.</p>
<p>The phenomena of the <i>absorption</i> of light have no especial
bearing upon the undulatory theory. There is not much difficulty in
explaining the <em>possibility</em> of absorption upon the theory.
When the light is absorbed, it ceases to belong to the theory. <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page111">111</a></span></p>
<p>For, as I have said, the theory professes only to explain the
phenomena of <i>radiant visible</i> light. We know very well that
light has other bearings and properties. It produces chemical effects.
The optical polarity of crystals is connected with the chemical
polarity of their constitution. The natural colors of bodies, too, are
connected with their chemical constitution. Light is also connected
with heat. The undulatory theory does not undertake to explain these
properties and their connexion. If it did, it would be a Theory of
Heat and of Chemical Composition, as well as a Theory of Light.</p>
<p>Dr. Faraday’s recent experiments have shown that the magnetic
polarity is directly connected with that optical polarity by which the
plane of polarization is affected. When the lines of magnetic force
pass through certain transparent bodies, they communicate to them a
certain kind of circular polarizing power; yet different from the
circular polarizing power of quartz, and certain fluids mentioned in
<a href="#v2page82">chapter ix.</a></p>
<p>Perhaps I may be allowed to refer to this discovery as a further
illustration of the views I have offered in the <i>Philosophy of the
Inductive Sciences</i> respecting the <i>Connexion of Co-existent
Polarities</i>. (B. v. Chap. ii.)]</p>

<span class="sc">Sequel to the Epoch of Young and Fresnel. Reception
of the Undulatory Theory.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">WHEN</span> Young, in 1800, published
his assertion of the Principle of Interferences, as the true theory of
optical phenomena, the condition of England was not very favorable to
a fair appreciation of the value of the new opinion. The men of
science were strongly pre-occupied in favor of the doctrine of
emission, not only from a national interest in Newton’s glory, and a
natural reverence for his authority, but also from deference towards
the geometers of France, who were looked up to as our masters in the
application of mathematics to physics, and who were understood to be
Newtonians in this as in other subjects. A general tendency to an
atomic philosophy, which had begun to appear from the time of Newton,
operated powerfully; and <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page112">112</a></span> the hypothesis of emission was so easily
conceived, that, when recommended by high authority, it easily became
popular; while the hypothesis of luminiferous undulations, unavoidably
difficult to comprehend, even by the aid of steady thought, was
neglected, and all but forgotten.</p>
<p>Yet the reception which Young’s opinions met with was more harsh
than he might have expected, even taking into account all these
considerations. But there was in England no visible body of men,
fitted by their knowledge and character to pronounce judgment on such
a question, or to give the proper impulse and bias to public opinion.
The Royal Society, for instance, had not, for a long time, by custom
or institution, possessed or aimed at such functions. The writers of
“Reviews” alone, self-constituted and secret tribunals, claimed this
kind of authority. Among these publications, by far the most
distinguished about this period was the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>; and,
including among its contributors men of eminent science and great
talents, employing also a robust and poignant style of writing (often
certainly in a very unfair manner), it naturally exercised great
influence. On abstruse doctrines, intelligible to few persons, more
than on other subjects, the opinions and feelings expressed in a
Review must be those of the individual reviewer. The criticism on some
of Young’s early papers on optics was written by Mr. (afterwards Lord)
Brougham, who, as we have <a href="#v2page79">seen</a>, had experimented on diffraction,
following the Newtonian view, that of inflexion. Mr. Brougham was
perhaps at this time young enough<a id="fnanchor96-9"
href="#note96-9"><span class="fnanchor">96</span></a> to be somewhat
intoxicated with the appearance of judicial authority in matters of
science, which his office of anonymous reviewer gave him: and even in
middle-life, he was sometimes considered to be prone to indulge
himself in severe and sarcastic expressions. In January, 1803, was
published<a id="fnanchor97-9" href="#note97-9"><span
class="fnanchor">97</span></a> his critique on Dr. Young’s Bakerian
Lecture, <i>On the Theory of Light and Colors</i>, in which lecture
the doctrine of undulations and the law of interferences was
maintained. This critique was an uninterrupted strain of blame and
rebuke. “This paper,” the reviewer said, “contains nothing which
deserves the name either of experiment or discovery.” He charged the
writer with “dangerous relaxations of the principles of physical
logic.” “We wish,” he cried, “to recall philosophers to the strict and
severe methods of investigation,” describing them as those pointed out
by Bacon, Newton, and the like. Finally, Dr. Young’s speculations
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page113">113</a></span> were spoken of
as a hypothesis, which is a mere work of fancy; and the critic added,
“we cannot conclude our review without entreating the attention of the
Royal Society, which has admitted of late so many hasty and
unsubstantial papers into its <i>Transactions</i>;” which habit he
urged them to reform. The same aversion to the undulatory theory
appears soon after in another article by the same reviewer, on the
subject of Wollaston’s measures of the refraction of Iceland spar; he
says, “We are much disappointed to find that so acute and ingenious an
experimentalist should have adopted the wild optical theory of
vibrations.” The reviewer showed ignorance as well as prejudice in the
course of his remarks; and Young drew up an answer, which was ably
written, but being published separately had little circulation. We can
hardly doubt that these Edinburgh reviews had their effect in
confirming the general disposition to reject the undulatory
theory.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note96-9"

href="#fnanchor97-9">97</a></span> <i>Edin. Review</i>, vol. i. p.
450.</div>
<p>We may add, however, that Young’s mode of presenting his opinions
was not the most likely to win them favor; for his mathematical
reasonings placed them out of the reach of popular readers, while the
want of symmetry and system in his symbolical calculations, deprived
them of attractiveness for the mathematician. He himself gave a very
just criticism of his own style of writing, in speaking on another of
his works:<a id="fnanchor98-9" href="#note98-9"><span
class="fnanchor">98</span></a> “The mathematical reasoning, for want
of mathematical symbols, was not understood, even by tolerable
mathematicians. From a dislike of the affectation of algebraical
formality which he had observed in some foreign authors, he was led
into something like an affectation of simplicity, which was equally
inconvenient to a scientific reader.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note98-9"
href="#fnanchor98-9">98</a></span> See <i>Life of Young</i>, p.
54.</div>
<p>Young appears to have been aware of his own deficiency in the power
of drawing public favor, or even notice, to his discoveries. In 1802,
Davy writes to a friend, “Have you seen the theory of my colleague,
Dr. Young, on the undulations of an ethereal medium as the cause of
light? It is not likely to be a popular hypothesis, after what has
been said by Newton concerning it. He would be very much flattered if
you could offer any observations upon it, <em>whether for or against
it</em>.” Young naturally felt confident in his power of refuting
objections, and wanted only the opportunity of a public combat.</p>
<p>Dr. Brewster, who was, at this period, enriching optical knowledge
with so vast a train of new phenomena and laws, shared the general
aversion to the undulatory theory, which, indeed, he hardly overcame
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page114">114</a></span> thirty years
later. Dr. Wollaston was a person whose character led him to look long
at the laws of phenomena, before he attempted to determine their
causes; and it does not appear that he had decided the claims of the
rival theories in his own mind. Herschel (I now speak of the son) had
at first the general mathematical prejudice in favor of the emission
doctrine. Even when he had himself studied and extended the laws of
dipolarized phenomena, he translated them into the language of the
theory of moveable polarization. In 1819, he refers to, and corrects,
this theory; and says, it is now “relieved from every difficulty, and
entitled to rank with the fits of easy transmission and reflection as
a general and simple physical law;” a just judgment, but one which now
conveys less of praise than he then intended. At a later period, he
remarked that we cannot be certain that if the theory of emission had
been as much cultivated as that of undulation, it might not have been
as successful; an opinion which was certainly untenable after the fair
trial of the two theories in the case of diffraction, and extravagant
after Fresnel’s beautiful explanation of double refraction and
polarization. Even in 1827, in a <i>Treatise on Light</i>, published
in the <i>Encyclopædia Metropolitana</i>, he gives a section to the
calculations of the Newtonian theory; and appears to consider the
rivalry of the theories as still subsisting. But yet he there speaks
with a proper appreciation of the advantages of the new doctrine.
After tracing the prelude to it, he says, “But the unpursued
speculations of Newton, and the opinions of Hooke, however distinct,
must not be put in competition, and, indeed, ought scarcely to be
mentioned, with the elegant, simple, and comprehensive theory of
Young,&#8212;a theory which, if not founded in nature, is certainly
one of the happiest fictions that the genius of man ever invented to
grasp together natural phenomena, which, at their first discovery,
seemed in irreconcileable opposition to it. It is, in fact, in all its
applications and details, one succession of <em>felicities</em>;
insomuch, that we may almost be induced to say, if it be not true, it
deserves to be so.”</p>
<p>In France, Young’s theory was little noticed or known, except
perhaps by M. Arago, till it was revived by Fresnel. And though
Fresnel’s assertion of the undulatory theory was not so rudely
received as Young’s had been, it met with no small opposition from the
older mathematicians, and made its way slowly to the notice and
comprehension of men of science. M. Arago would perhaps have at once
adopted the conception of transverse vibrations, when it was suggested
by his fellow-laborer, Fresnel, if it had not been that he was a
member of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page115">115</a></span>
Institute, and had to bear the brunt of the war, in the frequent
discussions on the undulatory theory; to which theory Laplace, and
other leading members, were so vehemently opposed, that they would not
even listen with toleration to the arguments in its favor. I do not
know how far influences of this kind might operate in producing the
delays which took place in the publication of Fresnel’s papers. We
have <a href="#v2page101">seen</a> that he arrived at the conception
of transverse vibrations in 1816, as the true key to the understanding
of polarization. In 1817 and 1818, in a memoir read to the Institute,
he analysed and explained the perplexing phenomena of quartz, which he
ascribed to a <i>circular polarization</i>. This memoir had not been
printed, nor any extract from it inserted in the scientific journals,
in 1822, when he confirmed his views by further experiments.<a
id="fnanchor99-9" href="#note99-9"><span
class="fnanchor">99</span></a> His remarkable memoir, which solved the
extraordinary and capital problem of the connexion of double
refraction and crystallization, though written in 1821, was not
published till 1827. He appears by this time to have sought other
channels of publication. In 1822, he gave,<a id="fnanchor100-9"
href="#note100-9"><span class="fnanchor">100</span></a> in the
<i>Annales de Chimie et de Physique</i>, an explanation of refraction
on the principles of the undulatory theory; alleging, as the reason
for doing so, that the theory was still little known. And in
succeeding years there appeared in the same work, his theory of
reflection. His memoir on this subject (<i>Mémoire sur la Loi des
Modifications que la Réflexion imprime à la Lumière Polarisée</i>,)
was read to the Academy of Sciences in <span class="correction"
title="emened from 1853">1823</span>. But the original paper was
mislaid, and, for a time, supposed to be lost; it has since been
recovered among the papers of M. Fourier, and printed in the eleventh
volume of the Memoirs of the Academy.<a id="fnanchor101-9"
href="#note101-9"><span class="fnanchor">101</span></a> Some of the
speculations to which he refers, as communicated to the Academy, have

<p>Still Fresnel’s labors were, from the first, duly appreciated by
some of the most eminent of his countrymen. His <i>Memoir on
Diffraction</i> was, as we have seen, crowned in 1819: and, in 1822, a
Report upon his <i>Memoir on Double Refraction</i> was drawn up by a
commission consisting of MM. Ampère, Fourier, and Arago. In this
report<a id="fnanchor103-9" href="#note103-9"><span
class="fnanchor">103</span></a> Fresnel’s theory is spoken of as
confirmed by the most delicate tests. The reporters add, respecting
his “theoretical ideas on the particular kind of undulations which,
according to him, constitute light,” that “it would be impossible for
them to pronounce at present a decided <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page116">116</a></span> judgment,” but that “they have not
thought it right to delay any longer making known a work of which the
difficulty is attested by the fruitless efforts of the most skilful
philosophers, and in which are exhibited in the same brilliant degree,
the talent for experiment and the spirit of invention.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, a controversy between the theory of
undulations and the theory of moveable polarization which M. Biot had
proposed with a view of accounting for the colors produced by
dipolarizing crystals, had occurred among the French men of science.
It is clear that in some main features the two theories coincide; the
intervals of interference in the one theory being represented by the
intervals of the oscillations in the other. But these intervals in M.
Biot’s explanations were arbitrary hypotheses, suggested by these very
facts themselves; in Fresnel’s theory, they were essential parts of
the general scheme. M. Biot, indeed, does not appear to have been
averse from a coalition; for he allowed<a id="fnanchor104-9"
href="#note104-9"><span class="fnanchor">104</span></a> to Fresnel
that “the theory of undulations took the phenomena at a higher point
and carried them further.” And M. Biot could hardly have dissented
from M. Arago’s account of the matter, that Fresnel’s views
“<em>linked together</em>”<a id="fnanchor105-9"
href="#note105-9"><span class="fnanchor">105</span></a> the
oscillations of moveable polarization. But Fresnel, whose hypothesis
was all of one piece, could give up no part of it, although he allowed
the usefulness of M. Biot’s formulæ. Yet M. Biot’s speculations fell
in better with the views of the leading mathematicians of Paris. We
may consider as evidence of the favor with which they were looked
upon, the large space they occupy in the volumes of the Academy for
1811, 1812, 1817, and 1818. In 1812, the entire volume is filled with
a memoir of M. Biot’s on the subject of moveable polarization. This
doctrine also had some advantage in coming early before the world in a
didactic form, in his <i>Traité de Physique</i>, which was published
in 1816, and was the most complete treatise on general physics which
had appeared up to that time. In this and others of this author’s
writings, he expresses facts so entirely in the terms of his own
hypothesis, that it is difficult to separate the two. In the sequel M.
Arago was the most prominent of M. Biot’s opponents; and in his report
upon Fresnel’s memoir on the colors of crystalline plates, he exposed
the weaknesses of the theory of moveable polarization with some
severity. The details of this controversy need not occupy us; but we
may observe that this may be considered as the last struggle <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page117">117</a></span> in favor of the
theory of emission among mathematicians of eminence. After this crisis
of the war, the theory of moveable polarization lost its ground; and
the explanations of the undulatory theory, and the calculations
belonging to it, being published in the <i>Annales de Chimie et de
Physique</i>, of which M. Arago was one of the conductors, soon
diffused it over Europe.</p>

<p>It was probably in consequence of the delays to which we have
referred, in the publication of Fresnel’s memoirs, that as late as
December, 1826, the Imperial Academy at St Petersburg proposed, as one
of their prize-questions for the two following years, this,&#8212;“To
deliver the optical system of waves from all the objections which have
(as it appears) with justice been urged against it, and to apply it to
the polarization and double refraction of light.” In the programme to
this announcement, Fresnel’s researches on the subject are not alluded
to, though his memoir on diffraction is noticed; they were, therefore,
probably not known to the Russian Academy.</p>
<p>Young was always looked upon as a person of marvellous variety of
attainments and extent of knowledge; but during his life he hardly
held that elevated place among great discoverers which posterity will
probably assign him. In 1802, he was constituted Foreign Secretary of
the Royal Society, an office which he held during life; in 1827 he was
elected one of the eight Foreign Members of the Institute of France;
perhaps the greatest honor which men of science usually receive. The
fortune of his life in some other respects was of a mingled
complexion. His profession of a physician occupied, sufficiently to
fetter, without rewarding him; while he was Lecturer at the Royal
Institution, he was, in his lectures, too profound to be popular; and
his office of Superintendent of the <i>Nautical Almanac</i> subjected
him to much minute labor, and many petulant attacks of pamphleteers.
On the other hand, he had a leading part in the discovery of the
long-sought key to the Egyptian hieroglyphics; and thus the age which
was marked by two great discoveries, one in science and one in
literature, owed them both in a great measure to him. Dr. Young died
in 1829, when he had scarcely completed his fifty-sixth year. Fresnel
was snatched from science still more prematurely, dying, in 1827, at
the early age of thirty-nine.</p>
<p>We need not say that both these great philosophers possessed, in an
eminent degree, the leading characteristics of the discoverer’s mind,
perfect clearness of view, rich fertility of invention, and intense
love of knowledge. We cannot read without great interest a letter of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page118">118</a></span> Fresnel to
Young,<a id="fnanchor106-9" href="#note106-9"><span
class="fnanchor">106</span></a> in November, 1824: “For a long time
that sensibility, or that vanity, which people call love of glory, is
much blunted in me. I labor much less to catch the suffrages of the
public, than to obtain an inward approval which has always been the
sweetest reward of my efforts. Without doubt I have often wanted the
spur of vanity to excite me to pursue my researches in moments of
disgust and discouragement. But all the compliments which I have
received from MM. Arago, De Laplace, or Biot, never gave me so much
pleasure as the discovery of a theoretical truth, or the confirmation
of a calculation by experiment.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note106-9"
href="#fnanchor106-9">106</a></span> I was able to give this, and some
other extracts, from the then unedited correspondence of Young and
Fresnel, by the kindness of (the Dean of Ely) Professor Peacock, of
Trinity College, Cambridge, whose Life of Dr. Young has since been
published.</div>
<p>Though Young and Fresnel were in years the contemporaries of many
who are now alive, we must consider ourselves as standing towards them
in the relation of posterity. The Epoch of Induction in Optics is
past; we have now to trace the Verification and Application of the
true theory.</p>
<hr class="three space-above" />
<h3 id="b9-13">CHAPTER XIII.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Confirmation and Extension of the Undulatory
Theory.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">AFTER</span> the undulatory theory
had been developed in all its main features, by its great authors,
Young and Fresnel, although it bore marks of truth that could hardly
be fallacious, there was still here, as in the case of other great
theories, a period in which difficulties were to be removed,
objections answered, men’s minds familiarized to the new conceptions
thus presented to them; and in which, also, it might reasonably be
expected that the theory would be extended to facts not at first
included in its domain. This period is, indeed, that in which we are
living; and we might, perhaps with propriety, avoid the task of
speaking of our living contemporaries. But it would be unjust to the
theory not to notice some of the remarkable events, characteristic of
such a period, which have already occurred; and this may be done very
simply. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page119">119</a></span></p>
<p>In the case of this great theory, as in that of gravitation, by far
the most remarkable of these confirmatory researches were conducted by
the authors of the discovery, especially Fresnel. And in looking at
what he conceived and executed for this purpose, we are, it appears to
me, strongly reminded of Newton, by the wonderful inventiveness and
sagacity with which he devised experiments, and applied to them
mathematical reasonings.</p>
<p>1. <i>Double Refraction of Compressed Glass.</i>&#8212;One of these
confirmatory experiments was the production of double refraction by
the compression of glass. Fresnel observes,<a id="fnanchor107-9"
href="#note107-9"><span class="fnanchor">107</span></a> that though
Sir D. Brewster had shown that glass under compression produced colors
resembling those which are given by doubly-refracting crystals, “very
skilful physicists had not considered those experiments as a
sufficient proof of the bifurcation of the light.” In the hypothesis
of moveable polarization, it is added, there is no apparent connexion
between these phenomena of coloration and double refraction; but on
Young’s theory, that the colors arise from two rays which have
traversed the crystal with different velocities, it appears almost
unavoidable to admit also a difference of path in the two rays.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note107-9"
href="#fnanchor107-9">107</a></span> <i>Ann. de Chim.</i> 1822, tom.
xx. p. 377.</div>
<p>“Though,” he says, “I had long since adopted this opinion, it did
not appear to me so completely demonstrated, that it was right to
neglect an experimental verification of it;” and therefore, in 1819,
he proceeded to satisfy himself of the fact, by the phenomena of
diffraction. The trial left no doubt on the subject; but he still
thought it would be interesting actually to produce two images in
glass by compression; and by a highly-ingenious combination,
calculated to exaggerate the effect of the double refraction, which is
very feeble, even when the compression is most intense, he obtained
two distinct images. This evidence of the dependence of dipolarizing
structure upon a doubly-refracting state of particles, thus
excogitated out of the general theory, and verified by trial, may well
be considered, as he says, “as a new occasion of proving the
infallibility of the principle of interferences.”</p>
<p>2. <i>Circular Polarization.</i>&#8212;Fresnel then turned his
attention to another set of experiments, related to this indeed, but
by a tie so recondite, that nothing less than his clearness and
acuteness of view could have detected any connexion. The optical
properties of quartz had been perceived to be peculiar, from the
period of the discovery <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page120">120</a></span> of dipolarized colors by MM. Arago and
Biot. At the end of the Notice just quoted, Fresnel says,<a
id="fnanchor108-9" href="#note108-9"><span
class="fnanchor">108</span></a> “As soon as my occupations permit me,
I propose to employ a pile of prisms similar to that which I have
described, in order to study the double refraction of the rays which
traverse crystals of quartz in the direction of the axis.” He then
ventures, without hesitation, to describe beforehand what the
phenomena will be. In the <i>Bulletin des Sciences</i><a
id="fnanchor109-9" href="#note109-9"><span
class="fnanchor">109</span></a> for December, 1822, it is stated that
experiment had confirmed what he had thus announced.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note108-9"
href="#fnanchor108-9">108</a></span> <i>Ann. de Chim.</i> 1822, tom.
xx. p. 382.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note109-9"
href="#fnanchor109-9">109</a></span> Ib. <i>Ann. de Chim.</i> 1822,
tom. xx. p. 191.</div>
<p>The phenomena are those which have since been spoken of as
<i>circular polarization</i>; and the term first occurs in this
notice.<a id="fnanchor110-9" href="#note110-9"><span
class="fnanchor">110</span></a> They are very remarkable, both by
their resemblances to, and their differences from, the phenomena of
<i>plane-polarized</i> light. And the manner in which Fresnel was led
to this anticipation of the facts is still more remarkable than the
facts themselves. Having ascertained by observation that two
differently-polarized rays, totally reflected at the internal surface
of glass, suffer different <em>retardations</em> of their undulations,
he applied the formulæ which he had obtained for the polarizing effect
of reflection to this case. But in this case the formulæ expressed an
impossibility; yet as algebraical formulæ, even in such cases, have
often some meaning, “I interpreted,” he says,<a id="fnanchor111-9"
href="#note111-9"><span class="fnanchor">111</span></a> “in the manner
which appeared to me most natural and most probable, what the analysis
indicated by this imaginary form;” and by such an interpretation he
collected the law of the difference of undulation of the two rays. He
was thus able to predict that by two internal reflections in a
<i>rhomb</i>, or parallelopiped of glass, of a certain form and
position, a polarized ray would acquire a circular undulation of its
particles; and this constitution of the ray, it appeared, by reasoning
further, would show itself by its possessing peculiar properties,
partly the same as those of polarized light, and partly different.
This extraordinary anticipation was exactly confirmed; and thus the
apparently bold and strange guess of the author was fully justified,
or at least assented to, even by the most cautious philosophers. “As I
cannot appreciate the mathematical evidence for the nature of circular
polarization,” says Prof. Airy,<a id="fnanchor112-9"
href="#note112-9"><span class="fnanchor">112</span></a> “I shall
mention the experimental evidence on which I receive it.” The
conception has since been universally adopted.</p>

<p>But Fresnel, having thus obtained circularly-polarized rays, saw
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page121">121</a></span> that he could
account for the phenomena of quartz, already observed by M. Arago, as
we have noticed in <a href="#b9-9">Chap. ix.</a>, by supposing two
circularly-polarized rays to pass, with different velocities, along
the axis. The curious succession of colors, following each other in
right-handed or left-handed circular order, of which we have <a
href="#v2page82">already</a> spoken, might thus be hypothetically
explained.</p>
<p>But was this hypothesis of two circularly-polarized rays,
travelling along the axis of such crystals, to be received, merely
because it accounted for the phenomena? Fresnel’s ingenuity again
enabled him to avoid such a defect in theorizing. If there were two
such rays, they might be visibly separated<a id="fnanchor113-9"
href="#note113-9"><span class="fnanchor">113</span></a> by the same
artifice, of a pile of prisms properly achromatized, which he had used
for compressed glass. The result was, that he did obtain a visible
separation of the rays; and this result has since been confirmed by
others, for instance. Professor Airy.<a id="fnanchor114-9"
href="#note114-9"><span class="fnanchor">114</span></a> The rays were
found to be in all respects identical with the circularly-polarized
rays produced by the internal reflections in Fresnel’s rhomb. This
kind of double refraction gave a hypothetical explanation of the laws
which M. Biot had obtained for the phenomena of this class; for
example,<a id="fnanchor115-9" href="#note115-9"><span
class="fnanchor">115</span></a> the rule, that the deviation of the
plane of polarization of the emergent ray is inversely as the square
of the length of an undulation for each kind of rays. And thus the
phenomena produced by light passing along the axis of quartz were
reduced into complete conformity with the theory.</p>

<p>[2nd Ed.] [I believe, however, Fresnel did not deduce the
phenomenon from the mathematical formula, without the previous
suggestion of experiment. He <em>observed</em> appearances which
implied a difference of retardation in the two differently-polarized
rays at total reflection; as Sir D. Brewster observed in reflection of
metals phenomena having a like character. The general fact being
observed, Fresnel used the theory to discover the law of this
retardation, and to determine a construction in which, one ray being a
quarter of an undulation retarded more than the other, circular
polarization would be produced. And this anticipation was verified by
the construction of his <i>rhomb</i>.</p>
<p>As a still more curious verification of this law, another of
Fresnel’s experiments may be mentioned. He found the proper angles for
a circularly-polarizing glass rhomb on the supposition that there were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page122">122</a></span> <em>four</em>
internal reflections instead of two; two of the four taking place when
the surface of the glass was dry, and two when it was wet. The rhomb
was made; and when all the points of reflection were dry, the light
was not circularly polarized; when two points were wet, the light was
circularly polarized; and when all four were wet, it was not
circularly polarized.]</p>
<p>3. <i>Elliptical Polarization in Quartz.</i>&#8212;We now come to
one of the few additions to Fresnel’s theory which have been shown to
be necessary. He had accounted fully for the colors produced by the
rays which travel <em>along the axis</em> of quartz crystals; and
thus, for the colors and changes of the central spot which is produced
when polarized light passes through a transverse plate of such
crystals. But this central spot is surrounded by rings of colors. How
is the theory to be extended to these?</p>
<p>This extension has been successfully made by Professor Airy.<a
id="fnanchor116-9" href="#note116-9"><span
class="fnanchor">116</span></a> His hypothesis is, that as rays
passing along the axis of a quartz crystal are circularly polarized,
rays which are oblique to the axis are elliptically polarized, the
amount of ellipticity depending, in some unknown manner, upon the
obliquity; and that each ray is separated by double refraction into
two rays polarized elliptically; the one right-handed, the other
left-handed. By means of these suppositions, he not only was enabled
to account for the simple phenomena of single plates of quartz; but
for many most complex and intricate appearances which arise from the
superposition of two plates, and which at first sight might appear to
defy all attempts to reduce them to law and symmetry; such as spirals,
curves approaching to a square form, curves broken in four places. “I
can hardly imagine,” he says,<a id="fnanchor117-9"
href="#note117-9"><span class="fnanchor">117</span></a> very
naturally, “that any other supposition would represent the phenomena
to such extreme accuracy. I am not so much struck with the accounting
for the continued dilatation of circles, and the general
representation of the forms of spirals, as with the explanations of
the minute deviations from symmetry; as when circles become almost
square, and crosses are inclined to the plane of polarization. And I
believe that any one who shall follow my investigation, and imitate my
experiments, will be surprised at their perfect agreement.”</p>

href="#fnanchor117-9">117</a></span> <i>Camb. Trans.</i>, iv. p.
122.</div>
<p>4. <i>Differential Equations of Elliptical
Polarization.</i>&#8212;Although circular and elliptical polarization
can be clearly conceived, and their existence, it would seem,
irresistibly established by the phenomena, it <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page123">123</a></span> is extremely difficult to conceive any
arrangement of the particles of bodies by which such motions can
mechanically be produced; and this difficulty is the greater, because
some fluids and some gases impress a circular polarization upon light;
in which cases we cannot imagine any definite arrangement of the
particles, such as might form the mechanism requisite for the purpose.
Accordingly, it does not appear that any one has been able to suggest
even a plausible hypothesis on that subject. Yet, even here, something
has been done. Professor Mac Cullagh, of Dublin, has discovered that
by slightly modifying the <i>analytical expressions</i> resulting from
the common case of the propagation of light, we may obtain other
expressions which would give rise to such motions as produce circular
and elliptical polarization. And though we cannot as yet assign the
mechanical interpretation of the language of analysis thus
generalized, this generalization brings together and explains by one
common numerical supposition, two distinct classes of facts;&#8212;a
circumstance which, in all cases, entitles an hypothesis to a very
favorable consideration.</p>
<p>Mr. Mac Cullagh’s assumption consists in adding to the two
equations of motion which are expressed by means of second
differentials, two other terms involving third differentials in a
simple and symmetrical manner. In doing this, he introduces a
coefficient, of which the magnitude determines both the amount of
rotation of the polarization of a ray passing along the axis, as
observed and measured by Biot, and the ellipticity of the polarization
of a ray which is oblique to the axis, according to Mr. Airy’s theory,
of which ellipticity that philosopher also had obtained certain
measures. The agreement between the two sets of measures<a
id="fnanchor118-9" href="#note118-9"><span
class="fnanchor">118</span></a> thus brought into connexion is such as
very strikingly to confirm Mr. Mac Cullagh’s hypothesis. It appears
probable, too, that the confirmation of this hypothesis involves,
although in an obscure and oracular form, a confirmation of the
undulatory theory, which is the starting-point of this curious
speculation.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note118-9"
href="#fnanchor118-9">118</a></span> <i>Royal I. A. Trans.</i>
1836.</div>
<p>5. <i>Elliptical Polarization of Metals.</i>&#8212;The effect of
metals upon the light which they reflect, was known from the first to
be different from that which transparent bodies produce. Sir David
Brewster, who has recently examined this subject very fully,<a
id="fnanchor119-9" href="#note119-9"><span
class="fnanchor">119</span></a> has described the modification thus
produced, as <i>elliptic polarization</i>. In employing this term, “he
seems to have been led,” it has been observed,<a id="fnanchor120-9"
href="#note120-9"><span class="fnanchor">120</span></a> “by a <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page124">124</a></span> desire to avoid as
much as possible all reference to theory. The laws which he has
obtained, however, belong to elliptically-polarized light in the sense
in which the term was introduced by Fresnel.” And the identity of the
light produced by metallic reflection with the elliptically-polarized
light of the wave-theory, is placed beyond all doubt, by an
observation of Professor Airy, that the rings of uniaxal crystals,
produced by Fresnel’s elliptically-polarized light, are exactly the
same as those produced by Brewster’s metallic light.</p>

<p>6. <i>Newton’s Rings by Polarized Light.</i>&#8212;Other
modifications of the phenomena of thin plates by the use of polarized
light, supplied other striking confirmations of the theory. These were
in one case the more remarkable, since the result was foreseen by
means of a rigorous application of the conception of the vibratory
motion of light, and confirmed by experiment. Professor Airy, of
Cambridge, was led by his reasonings to see, that if Newton’s rings
are produced between a lens and a plate of metal, by polarized light,
then, up to the polarizing angle, the central spot will be black, and
instantly beyond this, it will be white. In a note,<a
id="fnanchor121-9" href="#note121-9"><span
class="fnanchor">121</span></a> in which he announced this, he says,
“This I anticipated from Fresnel’s expressions; it is confirmatory of
them, and defies emission.” He also predicted that when the rings were
produced between two substances of very different refractive powers,
the centre would twice pass from black to white and from white to
black, by increasing the angle; which anticipation was fulfilled by
using a diamond for the higher refraction.<a id="fnanchor122-9"
href="#note122-9"><span class="fnanchor">122</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note121-9"
href="#fnanchor121-9">121</a></span> Addressed to myself, dated May
28, 1831. I ought, however, to notice, that this experiment had been
made by M. Arago, fifteen years earlier, and published: though not
then recollected by Mr. Airy.</div>

<p id="b9-12-7">7. <i>Conical Refraction.</i>&#8212;In the same
manner. Professor Hamilton of Dublin pointed out that according to the
Fresnelian doctrine of double refraction, there is a certain direction
of a crystal in which a single ray of light will be refracted so as to
form a <i>conical pencil</i>. For the direction of the refracted ray
is determined by a plane which touches the wave surface, the rule
being that the ray must pass from the centre of the surface to the
point of contact; and though in general this contact gives a single
point only, it so happens, from the peculiar inflected form of the
wave surface, which has what is called <i>a cusp</i>, that in one
particular position, the plane can touch the surface in an entire
circle. Thus the general rule which assigns the path of <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page125">125</a></span> the refracted ray,
would, in this case, guide it from the centre of the surface to every
point in the circumference of the circle, and thus make it a cone.
This very curious and unexpected result, which Professor Hamilton thus
obtained from the theory, his friend Professor Lloyd verified as an
experimental fact. We may notice, also, that Professor Lloyd found the
light of the conical pencil to be polarized according to a law of an
unusual kind; but one which was easily seen to be in complete
accordance with the theory.</p>
<p>8. <i>Fringes of Shadows.</i>&#8212;The phenomena of the <i>fringes
of shadows</i> of small holes and groups of holes, which had been the
subject of experiment by Fraunhofer, were at a later period carefully
observed in a vast variety of cases by M. Schwerd of Spires, and
published in a separate work,<a id="fnanchor123-9"
href="#note123-9"><span class="fnanchor">123</span></a>
<i>Beugungs-erscheinungen</i> (Phenomena of Inflection), 1836. In this
Treatise, the author has with great industry and skill calculated the
integrals which, as we have seen, are requisite in order to trace the
consequences of the theory; and the accordance which he finds between
these and the varied and brilliant results of observation is
throughout exact. “I shall,” says he, in the preface,<a
id="fnanchor124-9" href="#note124-9"><span
class="fnanchor">124</span></a> “prove by the present Treatise, that
all inflection-phenomena, through openings of any form, size, and
arrangement, are not only explained by the undulation-theory, but that
they can be represented by analytical expressions, determining the
intensity of the light in any point whatever.” And he justly adds,
that the undulation-theory accounts for the phenomena of light, as
completely as the theory of gravitation does for the facts of the
solar system.</p>

<p>9. <i>Objections to the Theory.</i>&#8212;We have hitherto
mentioned only cases in which the undulatory theory was either
entirely successful in explaining the facts, or at least
hypothetically consistent with them and with itself. But other
objections were started, and some difficulties were long considered as
very embarrassing. Objections were made to the theory by some English
experimenters, as Mr. Potter, Mr. Barton, and others. These appeared
in scientific journals, and were afterwards answered in similar
publications. The objections depended partly on the measure of the
<em>intensity</em> of light in the different points of the phenomena
(a datum which it is very difficult to obtain with accuracy <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page126">126</a></span> by experiment), and
partly on misconceptions of the theory; and I believe there are none
of them which would now be insisted on.</p>
<p>We may mention, also, another difficulty, which it was the habit of
the opponents of the theory to urge as a reproach against it, long
after it had been satisfactorily explained: I mean the
<i>half-undulation</i> which Young and Fresnel had found it necessary,
in some cases, to assume as gained or lost by one of the rays. Though
they and their followers could not analyse the mechanism of reflection
with sufficient exactness to trace out all the circumstances, it was
not difficult to see, upon Fresnel’s principles, that reflection from
the interior and exterior surface of glass must be of opposite kinds,
which might be expressed by supposing one of these rays to lose half
an undulation. And thus there came into view a justification of the
step which had originally been taken upon empirical grounds alone.</p>
<p>10. <i>Dispersion, on the Undulatory Theory.</i>&#8212;A difficulty
of another kind occasioned a more serious and protracted embarrassment
to the cultivators of this theory. This was the apparent impossibility
of accounting, on the theory, for the prismatic dispersion of color.
For it had been shown by Newton that the amount of refraction is
different for every color; and the amount of refraction depends on the
velocity with which light is propagated. Yet the theory suggested no
reason why the velocity should be different for different colors: for,
by mathematical calculation, vibrations of all degrees of rapidity (in
which alone colors differ) are propagated with the same speed. Nor
does analogy lead us to expect this variety. There is no such
difference between quick and slow waves of air. The sounds of the
deepest and the highest bells of a peal are heard at any distance in
the same order. Here, therefore, the theory was at fault.</p>
<p>But this defect was far from being a fatal one. For though the
theory did not explain, it did not contradict, dispersion. The
suppositions on which the calculations had been conducted, and the
analogy of sound, were obviously in no small degree precarious. The
velocity of propagation might differ for different rates of
undulation, in virtue of many causes which would not affect the
general theoretical results.</p>
<p>Many such hypothetical causes were suggested by various eminent
mathematicians, as solutions of this conspicuous difficulty. But
without dwelling upon these conjectures, it may suffice to notice that
hypothesis upon which the attention of mathematicians was soon
concentrated. This was the <i>hypothesis of finite intervals</i>
between the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page127">127</a></span>
particles of the ether. The length of one of those undulations which
produce light, is a very small quantity, its mean value being <span
style="font-size: 80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>50,000</sub></span>th
of an inch; but in the previous investigations of the consequences of
the theory, it had been assumed that the distance from each other, of
the particles of the ether, which, by their attractions or repulsions,
caused the undulations to be propagated, is indefinitely less than
this small quantity;&#8212;so that its amount might be neglected in
the cases in which the length of the undulation was one of the
quantities which determined the result. But this assumption was made
arbitrarily, as a step of simplification, and because it was imagined
that, in this way, a nearer approach was made to the case of a
continuous fluid ether, which the supposition of distinct particles
imperfectly represented. It was still free for mathematicians to
proceed upon the opposite assumption, of particles of which the
distances were finite, either as a mathematical basis of calculation,
or as a physical hypothesis; and it remained to be seen if, when this
was done, the velocity of light would still be the same for different
lengths of undulation, that is, for different colors. M. Cauchy,
calculating, upon the most general principles, the motion of such a
collection of particles as would form an elastic medium, obtained
results which included the new extension of the previous hypothesis.
Professor Powell, of Oxford, applied himself to reduce to calculation,
and to compare with experiment, the result of these researches. And it
appeared that, on M. Cauchy’s principles, a variation in the velocity
of light is produced by a variation in the length of the wave,
provided that the interval between the molecules of the ether bears a
sensible ratio to the length of an undulation.<a id="fnanchor125-9"
href="#note125-9"><span class="fnanchor">125</span></a> Professor
Powell obtained also, from the general expressions, a formula
expressing the relation between the refractive index of a ray, and the
length of a wave, or the color of light.<a id="fnanchor126-9"
href="#note126-9"><span class="fnanchor">126</span></a> It then became
his task to ascertain whether this relation obtained experimentally;
and he found a very close agreement between the numbers which resulted
from the formula and those observed by Fraunhofer, for ten different
kinds of media, namely, certain glasses and fluids.<a
id="fnanchor127-9" href="#note127-9"><span
class="fnanchor">127</span></a> To these he afterwards added ten other
cases of crystals observed by M. Rudberg.<a id="fnanchor128-9"
href="#note128-9"><span class="fnanchor">128</span></a> Mr. Kelland,
of Cambridge, also calculated, in a manner somewhat different, the
results of the same hypothesis of finite intervals;<a
id="fnanchor129-9" href="#note129-9"><span
class="fnanchor">129</span></a> and, obtaining <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page128">128</a></span> formulæ not exactly
the same as Professor Powell, found also an agreement between these
and Fraunhofer’s observations.</p>

<p>It may be observed, that the refractive indices observed and
employed in these comparisons, were not those determined by the color
of the ray, which is not capable of exact identification, but those
more accurate measures which Fraunhofer was enabled to make, in
consequence of having detected in the spectrum the black lines which
he called B, C, D, E, F, G, H. The agreement between the theoretical
formulæ and the observed numbers is remarkable, throughout all the
series of comparisons of which we have spoken. Yet we must at present
hesitate to pronounce upon the hypothesis of finite intervals, as
proved by these calculations; for though this hypothesis has given
results agreeing so closely with experiment, it is not yet clear that
other hypotheses may not produce an equal agreement. By the nature of
the case, there must be a certain gradation and continuity in the
succession of colors in the spectrum, and hence, any supposition which
will account for the general fact of the whole dispersion, may
possibly account for the amount of the intermediate dispersions,
because these must be interpolations between the extremes. The result
of this hypothetical calculation, however, shows very satisfactorily
that there is not, in the fact of dispersion, anything which is at all
formidable to the undulatory theory.</p>
<p id="b9-13-11">11. <i>Conclusion.</i>&#8212;There are several other
of the more recondite points of the theory which may be considered as,
at present, too undecided to allow us to speak historically of the
discussions which they have occasioned.<a id="fnanchor130-9"
href="#note130-9"><span class="fnanchor">130</span></a> For example,
it was conceived, for some time, that the vibrations of polarized
light are perpendicular to the plane of polarization. But this
assumption was not an essential part of the theory; and all the
phenomena would equally allow us to suppose the vibrations to be in
the polarization plane; the main requisite being, that light polarized
in planes at right angles to each other, should also have the
vibrations at right angles. Accordingly, for some time, this point was
left undecided by Young and Fresnel, and, more recently, some
mathematicians have come to the opinion that ether vibrates in the
plane of polarization. The theory of transverse vibrations is equally
stable, whichever supposition may be finally confirmed. ~Additional
material in the <a href="#v2page603">3rd edition</a>.~</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note130-9"
href="#fnanchor130-9">130</a></span>  For on account of these, see
Professor Lloyd’s <i>Report on Physical Optics</i>. (Brit. Assoc.
Report, 1834.)</div>
<p>We may speak, in the same manner, of the suppositions which, from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page129">129</a></span> the time of
Young and Fresnel, the cultivators of this theory have been led to
make respecting the mechanical constitution of the ether, and the
forces by which transverse vibrations are produced. It was natural
that various difficulties should arise upon such points, for
transverse vibrations had not previously been made the subject of
mechanical calculation, and the forces which occasion them must act in
a different manner from those which were previously contemplated.
Still, we may venture to say, without entering into these discussions,
that it has appeared, from all the mathematical reasonings which have
been pursued, that there is not, in the conception of transverse
vibrations, anything inconsistent either with the principles of
mechanics, or with the best general views which we can form, of the
forces by which the universe is held together.</p>
<p>I willingly speak as briefly as the nature of my undertaking
allows, of those points of the undulatory theory which are still under
deliberation among mathematicians. With respect to these, an intimate
acquaintance with mathematics and physics is necessary to enable any
one to understand the steps which are made from day to day; and still
higher philosophical qualifications would be requisite in order to
pronounce a judgment upon them. I shall, therefore, conclude this
survey by remarking the highly promising condition of this great
department of science, in respect to the character of its cultivators.
Nothing less than profound thought and great mathematical skill can
enable any one to deal with this theory, in any way likely to promote
the interests of science. But there appears, in the horizon of the
scientific world, a considerable class of young mathematicians, who
are already bringing to these investigations the requisite talents and
zeal; and who, having acquired their knowledge of the theory since the
time when its acceptation was doubtful, possess, without effort, that
singleness and decision of view as to its fundamental doctrines, which
it is difficult for those to attain whose minds have had to go through
the hesitation, struggle, and balance of the epoch of the
establishment of the theory. In the hands of this new generation, it
is reasonable to suppose the Analytical Mechanics of light will be
improved as much as the Analytical Mechanics of the solar system was
by the successors of Newton. We have already had to notice many of
this younger race of undulationists. For besides MM. Cauchy, Poisson,
and Ampère, M. Lamé has been more recently following these researches
in France.<a id="fnanchor131-9" href="#note131-9"><span
class="fnanchor">131</span></a> In <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page130">130</a></span> Belgium, M. Quetelet has given great
attention to them; and, in our own country, Sir William Hamilton, and
Professor Lloyd, of Dublin, have been followed by Mr. Mac Cullagh.
Professor Powell, of Oxford, has continued his researches with
unremitting industry; and, at Cambridge, Professor Airy, who did much
for the establishment and diffusion of the theory before he was
removed to the post of Astronomer Royal, at Greenwich, has had the
satisfaction to see his labors continued by others, even to the most
recent time; for Mr. Kelland,<a id="fnanchor132-9"
href="#note132-9"><span class="fnanchor">132</span></a> whom we have
already mentioned, and Mr. Archibald Smith,<a id="fnanchor133-9"
href="#note133-9"><span class="fnanchor">133</span></a> the two
persons who, in 1834 and 1836, received the highest mathematical
honors which that university can bestow, have both of them published
investigations respecting the undulatory theory.</p>

<p>We may be permitted to add, as a reflection obviously suggested by
these facts, that the cause of the progress of science is incalculably
benefited by the existence of a body of men, trained and stimulated to
the study of the higher mathematics, such as exist in the British
universities, who are thus prepared, when an abstruse and sublime
theory comes before the world with all the characters of truth, to
appreciate its evidence, to take steady hold of its principles, to
pursue its calculations, and thus to convert into a portion of the
permanent treasure and inheritance of the civilized world, discoveries
which might otherwise expire with the great geniuses who produced
them, and be lost for ages, as, in former times, great scientific
discoveries have sometimes been.</p>
<p>The reader who is acquainted with the history of recent optical
discovery, will see that we have omitted much which has justly excited
admiration; as, for example, the phenomena produced by glass under
heat or pressure, noticed by MM. Lobeck, and Biot, and Brewster, and
many most curious properties of particular minerals. We have omitted,
too, all notice of the phenomena and laws of the absorption of light,
which hitherto stand unconnected with the theory. But in this we have
not materially deviated from our main design; for our end, in what we
have done, has been to trace the advances of Optics <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page131">131</a></span> towards perfection as
a theory; and this task we have now nearly executed as far as our
abilities allow.</p>
<p>We have been desirous of showing that the <em>type</em> of this
progress, in the histories of the two great sciences, Physical
Astronomy and Physical Optics, is the same. In both we have many
<i>Laws of Phenomena</i> detected and accumulated by acute and
inventive men; we have <i>Preludial</i> guesses which touch the true
theory, but which remain for a time imperfect, undeveloped,
unconfirmed: finally we have the <i>Epoch</i> when this true theory,
clearly apprehended by great philosophical geniuses, is recommended by
its fully explaining what it was first meant to explain, and confirmed
by its explaining what it was not meant to explain. We have then its
<i>Progress</i> struggling for a little while with adverse
prepossessions and difficulties; finally overcoming all these, and
moving onwards, while its triumphal procession is joined by all the
younger and more vigorous men of science.</p>
<p>It would, perhaps, be too fanciful to attempt to establish a
parallelism between the prominent persons who figure in these two
histories. If we were to do this, we must consider Huyghens and Hooke
as standing in the place of Copernicus, since, like him, they
announced the true theory, but left it to a future age to give it
development and mechanical confirmation; Malus and Brewster, grouping
them together, correspond to Tycho Brahe and Kepler, laborious in
accumulating observations, inventive and happy in discovering laws of
phenomena; and Young and Fresnel combined, make up the Newton of
optical science.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [In the <i>Report on Physical Optics</i>, (<i>Brit. Ass.
Reports</i>, 1834,) by Prof. Lloyd, the progress of the mathematical
theory after Fresnel’s labors is stated more distinctly than I have
stated it, to the following effect. Ampère, in 1828, proved Fresnel’s
mathematical results directly, which Fresnel had only proved
indirectly, and derived from his proof Fresnel’s beautiful geometrical
construction. Prof. Mac Cullagh not long after gave a concise
demonstration of the same theorem, and of the other principal points
of Fresnel’s theory. He represents the elastic force by means of an
ellipsoid whose axes are inversely proportional to those of Fresnel’s
generating ellipsoid, and deduces Fresnel’s construction
geometrically. In the third Supplement to his <i>Essay on the Theory
of Systems of Rays</i> (<i>Trans. R. I. Acad.</i> vol. xvii.), Sir W.
Hamilton has presented that portion of Fresnel’s theory which relates
to the fundamental problem of the determination of the velocity and
polarization of a plane wave, in a very elegant and analytical form.
This he does by means of what he calls the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page132">132</a></span> <i>characteristic function</i> of the
optical system to which the problem belongs. From this function is
deduced the <i>surface of wave-slowness</i> of the medium; and by
means of this surface, the direction of the rays refracted into the
medium. From this construction also Sir W. Hamilton was led to the
anticipation of <i>conical refraction</i>, mentioned <a
href="#b9-12-7">above</a>.</p>
<p>The investigations of MM. Cauchy and Lamé refer to the laws by
which the particles of the ether act upon each other and upon the
particles of other bodies;&#8212;a field of speculation which appears
to me not yet ripe for the final operations of the analyst.</p>
<p>Among the mathematicians who have supplied defects in Fresnel’s
reasoning on this subject, I may mention Mr. Tovey, who treated it in
several papers in the <i>Philosophical Magazine</i> (1837–40). Mr.
Tovey’s early death must be deemed a loss to mathematical science.</p>
<p>Besides investigating the motion of symmetrical systems of
particles which may be supposed to correspond to biaxal crystals, Mr.
Tovey considered the case of unsymmetrical systems, and found that the
undulations propagated would, in the general case, be elliptical; and
that in a particular case, circular undulations would take place, such
as are propagated along the axis of quartz. It appears to me, however,
that he has not given a definite meaning to those limitations of his
general hypothesis which conduct him to this result. Perhaps if the
hypothetical conditions of this result were traced into detail, they
would be found to reside in a <i>screw-like</i> arrangement of the
elementary particles, in some degree such as crystals of quartz
themselves exhibit in their forms, when they have plagihedral faces at
both ends.</p>
<p>Such crystals of quartz are, some like a right-handed and some like
a left-handed screw; and, as Sir John Herschel discovered, the
circular polarization is right-handed or left-handed according as the
plagihedral form is so. In Mr. Tovey’s hypothetical investigation it
does not appear upon what part of the hypothesis this difference of
right and left-handed depends. The definition of this part of the
hypothesis is a very desirable step.</p>
<p>When crystals of Quartz are right-handed at one end, they are
right-handed at the other end: but there is a different kind of
plagihedral form, which occurs in some other crystals, for instance,
in Apatite: in these the plagihedral faces are right-handed at the one
extremity and left-handed at the other. For the sake of distinction,
we may call the former <i>homologous</i> plagihedral faces, since, at
both ends, they have the same name; and the latter <i>heterologous</i>
plagihedral faces. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page133">133</a></span></p>
<p>The homologous plagihedral faces of Quartz crystals are accompanied
by homologous circular polarization of the same name. I do not know
that heterologous circular polarization has been observed in any
crystal, but it has been discovered by Dr. Faraday to occur in glass,
&amp;c., when subjected to powerful magnetic action.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was presumptuous in me to attempt to draw such
comparisons, especially with regard to living persons, as I have done
in the preceding pages of this Book. Having published this passage,
however, I shall not now suppress it. But I may observe that the
immense number and variety of the beautiful optical discoveries which
we owe to Sir David Brewster makes the comparison in his case a very
imperfect representation of his triumphs over nature; and that,
besides his place in the history of the Theory of Optics, he must hold
a most eminent position in the history of Optical Crystallography,
whenever the discovery of a True Optical Theory of Crystals supplies
us with the <em>Epoch</em> to which his labors in this field form so
rich a <em>Prelude</em>. I cordially assent to the expression employed
by Mr. Airy in the <i>Phil. Trans.</i> for 1840, in which he speaks of
Sir David Brewster as “the Father of Modern Experimental Optics.”]</p>

<h3 class="space-above">INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<h4 class="five"><i>Of Thermotics and Atmology.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">I EMPLOY</span> the term
<i>Thermotics</i> to include all the doctrines respecting Heat, which
have hitherto been established on proper scientific grounds. Our
survey of the history of this branch of science must be more rapid and
less detailed than it has been in those subjects of which we have
hitherto treated: for our knowledge is, in this case, more vague and
uncertain than in the others, and has made less progress towards a
general and certain theory. Still, the narrative is too important and
too instructive to be passed over.</p>
<p>The distinction of Formal Thermotics and Physical
Thermotics,&#8212;of the discovery of the mere Laws of Phenomena, and
the discovery of their causes,&#8212;is applicable here, as in other
departments of our knowledge. But we cannot exhibit, in any prominent
manner, the latter division of the science now before us; since no
general theory of heat has yet been propounded, which affords the
means of calculating the circumstances of the phenomena of conduction,
radiation, expansion, and change of solid, liquid, and gaseous form.
Still, on each of these subjects there have been proposed, and
extensively assented to, certain general views, each of which explains
its appropriate class of phenomena; and, in some cases, these
principles have been clothed in precise and mathematical conditions,
and thus made bases of calculation.</p>
<p>These principles, thus possessing a generality of a limited kind,
connecting several observed laws of phenomena, but yet not connecting
all the observed classes of facts which relate to heat, will require
our separate attention. They may be described as the Doctrine of
Conduction, the Doctrine of Radiation, the Doctrine of Specific Heat,
and the Doctrine of Latent Heat; and these, and similar doctrines
respecting heat, make up the science which we may call <i>Thermotics
proper</i>.</p>
<p>But besides these collections of principles which regard heat by
itself, the relations of heat and moisture give rise to another and
important collection of laws and principles, which I shall treat of in
connexion with Thermotics, and shall term <i>Atmology</i>, borrowing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page138">138</a></span> the term from
the Greek word (ἄτμος,) which signifies <i>vapor</i>. The
<i>Atmosphere</i> was so named by the Greeks, as being a sphere of
vapor; and, undoubtedly, the most general and important of the
phenomena which take place in the air, by which the earth is
surrounded, are those in which water, of one <i>consistence</i> or
other (ice, water, or steam,) is concerned. The knowledge which
relates to what takes place in the atmosphere has been called
<i>Meteorology</i>, in its collective form: but such knowledge is, in
fact, composed of parts of many different sciences. And it is useful
for our purpose to consider separately those portions of Meteorology
which have reference to the laws of aqueous vapor, and these we may
include under the term Atmology.</p>
<p>The instruments which have been invented for the purpose of
measuring the moisture of the air, that is, the quantity of vapor
which exists in it, have been termed <i>Hygrometers</i>; and the
doctrines on which these instruments depend, and to which they lead,
have been called <i>Hygrometry</i>; but this term has not been used in
quite so extensive a sense as that which we intend to affix to
<i>Atmology</i>.</p>
<p>In treating of Thermotics, we shall first describe the earlier
progress of men’s views concerning Conduction, Radiation, and the
like, and shall then speak of the more recent corrections and
extensions, by which they have been brought nearer to theoretical
generality.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="sc">BY</span> <i>conduction</i> is meant
the propagation of heat from one part to another of a continuous body;
or from one body to another in contact with it; as when one end of a
poker stuck in the fire heats the other end, or when this end heats
the hand which takes hold of it. By <i>radiation</i> is meant the
diffusion of heat from the surface of a body to points not in contact.
It is clear in both these cases, that, in proportion as the hot
portion is hotter, it produces a greater effect in warming the cooler
portion; that is, it <i>communicates more Heat</i> to it, if
<i>Heat</i> be the abstract conception of which this effect is the
measure. The simplest rule which can be proposed is, that the heat
thus communicated in a given instant is proportional to the excess of
the heat of the hot body over that of the contiguous bodies; there are
no obvious phenomena which contradict the supposition that this is the
true law; and it was thence assumed by Newton as the true law for
radiation and by other writers for conduction. This assumption was
confirmed approximately, and afterwards corrected, for the case of
Radiation; in its application to Conduction, it has been made the
basis of calculation up to the present time. We may observe that this
statement takes for granted that we have attained to a measure of heat
(or of <i>temperature</i>, as heat thus measured is termed),
corresponding to the law thus assumed; and, in fact, as we shall have
occasion to explain in speaking of the <i>measures</i> of sensible
qualities, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page140">140</a></span> the
thermometrical scale of heat according to the expansion of liquids
(which is the measure of temperature here adopted), was constructed
with a reference to Newton’s law of radiation of heat; and thus the
law is necessarily consistent with the scale.</p>
<p>In any case in which the parts of a body are unequally hot, the
temperature will vary <i>continuously</i> in passing from one part of
the body to another; thus, a long bar of iron, of which one end is
kept red hot, will exhibit a gradual diminution of temperature at
successive points, proceeding to the other end. The law of temperature
of the parts of such a bar might be expressed by the ordinates of a
<i>curve</i> which should run alongside the bar. And, in order to
trace mathematically the consequences of the assumed law, some of
those processes would be necessary, by which mathematicians are
enabled to deal with the properties of curves; as the method of
infinitesimals, or the differential calculus; and the truth or
falsehood of the law would be determined, according to the usual rules
of inductive science, by a comparison of results so deduced from the
principle, with the observed phenomena.</p>
<p>It was easily perceived that this comparison was the task which
physical inquirers had to perform; but the execution of it was delayed
for some time; partly, perhaps, because the mathematical process
presented some difficulties. Even in a case so simple as that above
mentioned, of a linear bar with a stationary temperature at one end,
<i>partial differentials</i> entered; for there were three variable
quantities, the time, as well as the place of each point and its
temperature. And at first, another scruple occurred to M. Biot when,
about 1804, he undertook this problem.<a id="fnanchor1-10"
href="#note1-10"><span class="fnanchor">1</span></a> “A difficulty,”
says Laplace,<a id="fnanchor2-10" href="#note2-10"><span
class="fnanchor">2</span></a> in 1809, “presents itself, which has not
yet been solved. The quantities of heat received and communicated in
an instant (by any point of the bar) must be infinitely small
quantities of the same order as the excess of the heat of a slice of
the body over that of the contiguous slice; therefore the
<em>excess</em> of the heat received by any slice over the heat
communicated, is an infinitely small quantity of the second order; and
the accumulation in a finite time (which depends on this excess)
cannot be finite.” I conceive that this difficulty arises entirely
from an arbitrary and unnecessary assumption concerning the relation
of the infinitesimal parts of the body. Laplace resolved the
difficulty by further reasoning founded upon the same assumption which
occasioned <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page141">141</a></span> it;
but Fourier, who was the most distinguished of the cultivators of this
mathematical doctrine of conduction, follows a course of reasoning in
which the difficulty does not present itself. Indeed it is stated by
Laplace, in the Memoir above quoted,<a id="fnanchor3-10"
href="#note3-10"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a> that Fourier had
already obtained the true fundamental equations by views of his
own.</p>

<p>The remaining part of the history of the doctrine of conduction is
principally the history of Fourier’s labors. Attention having been
drawn to the subject, as we have mentioned, the French Institute, in
January, 1810, proposed, as their prize question, “To give the
mathematical theory of the laws of the propagation of heat, and to
compare this theory with exact observations.” Fourier’s Memoir (the
sequel of one delivered in 1807,) was sent in September, 1811; and the
prize (3000 francs) adjudged to it in 1812. In consequence of the
political confusion which prevailed in France, or of other causes,
these important Memoirs were not published by the Academy till 1824;
but extracts had been printed in the <i>Bulletin des Sciences</i> in
1808, and in the <i>Annales de Chimie</i> in 1816; and Poisson and M.
Cauchy had consulted the manuscript itself.</p>
<p>It is not my purpose to give, in this place,<a id="fnanchor4-10"
href="#note4-10"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a> an account of the
analytical processes by which Fourier obtained his results. The skill
displayed in these Memoirs is such as to make them an object of just
admiration to mathematicians; but they consist entirely of deductions
from the fundamental principle which I have noticed,&#8212;that the
quantity of heat conducted from a hotter to a colder point is
proportional to the excess of heat, modified by the
<i>conductivity</i>, or conducting power of each substance. The
equations which flow from this principle assume nearly the same forms
as those which occur in the most general problems of hydrodynamics.
Besides Fourier’s solution, Laplace, Poisson, and M. Cauchy have also
exercised their great analytical skill in the management of these
formulæ. We shall briefly speak of the comparison of the results of
these reasonings with experiment, and notice some other consequences
to which they lead. But before we can do this, we must pay some
attention to the subject of radiation.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note4-10"
href="#fnanchor4-10">4</a></span> I have given an account of Fourier’s
mathematical results in the <i>Reports of the British Association</i>
for 1835. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page142">142</a></span></div>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Introduction of the Doctrine of
Radiation.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">A hot</span> body, as a mass of
incandescent iron, emits heat, as we perceive by our senses when we
approach it; and by this emission of heat the hot body cools down. The
first step in our systematic knowledge of the subject was made in the
<i>Principia</i>. “It was in the destiny of that great work,” says
Fourier, “to exhibit, or at least to indicate, the causes of the
principal phenomena of the universe.” Newton assumed, as we have <a
href="#v2page139">already</a> said, that the rate at which a body
cools, that is, parts with its heat to surrounding bodies, is
proportional to its heat; and on this assumption he rested the
verification of his scale of temperatures. It is an easy deduction
from this law, that if times of cooling be taken in arithmetical
progression, the heat will decrease in geometrical progression. Kraft,
and after him Richman, tried to verify this law by direct experiments
on the cooling of vessels of warm water; and from these experiments,
which have since been repeated by others, it appears that for
differences of temperature which do not exceed 50 degrees (boiling
water being 100), this geometrical progression represents, with
tolerable (but not with complete) accuracy, the process of
cooling.</p>
<p>This principle of radiation, like that of conduction, required to
be followed out by mathematical reasoning. But it required also to be
corrected in the first place, for it was easily seen that the rate of
cooling depended, not on the absolute temperature of the body, but on
the excess of its temperature above the surrounding objects to which
it communicated its heat in cooling. And philosophers were naturally
led to endeavor to explain or illustrate this process by some physical
notions. Lambert in 1765 published<a id="fnanchor5-10"
href="#note5-10"><span class="fnanchor">5</span></a> an <i>Essay on
the Force of Heat</i>, in which he assimilates the communication of
heat to the flow of a fluid out of one vessel into another by an
excess of pressure; and mathematically deduces the laws of the process
on this ground. But some additional facts suggested a different view
of the subject. It was found that heat is propagated by radiation
according to straight lines, like light; and that it is, as light is,
capable of being reflected by mirrors, and thus brought to a focus of
intenser action. In this manner the radiative effect of a body could
be more precisely traced. A fact, however, came under notice, which,
at first sight, appeared to <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page143">143</a></span> offer some difficulty. It appeared that
cold was reflected no less than heat. A mass of ice, when its effect
was concentrated on a thermometer by a system of mirrors, made the
thermometer fall, just as a vessel of hot water placed in a similar
situation made it rise. Was cold, then, to be supposed a real
substance, no less than heat?</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note5-10"
href="#fnanchor5-10">5</a></span> <i>Act. Helvet.</i> tom. ii. p.
172.</div>
<p>The solution of this and similar difficulties was given by Pierre
Prevost, professor at Geneva, whose theory of radiant heat was
proposed about 1790. According to this theory, heat, or
<i>caloric</i>, is constantly radiating from every point of the
surface of all bodies in straight lines; and it radiates the more
copiously, the greater is the quantity of heat which the body
contains. Hence a constant exchange of heat is going on among
neighboring bodies; and a body grows hotter or colder, according as it
receives more caloric than it emits, or the contrary. And thus a body
is cooled by rectilinear rays from a cold body, because along these
paths it sends rays of heat in greater abundance than those which
return the same way. This <i>theory of exchanges</i> is simple and
satisfactory, and was soon generally adopted; but we must consider it
rather as the simplest mode of expressing the dependence of the
communication of heat on the excess of temperature, than as a
proposition of which the physical truth is clearly established.</p>
<p>A number of curious researches on the effect of the different kinds
of surface of the heating and of the heated body, were made by Leslie
and others. On these I shall not dwell; only observing that the
relative amount of this radiative and receptive energy may be
expressed by numbers, for each kind of surface; and that we shall have
occasion to speak of it under the term <i>exterior conductivity</i>;
it is thus distinguished from <i>interior conductivity</i>, which is
the relative rate at which heat is conducted in the interior of
bodies.<a id="fnanchor6-10" href="#note6-10"><span
class="fnanchor">6</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note6-10"
href="#fnanchor6-10">6</a></span> The term employed by Fourier,
<i>conductibility</i> or <i>conducibility</i>, suggests expressions
altogether absurd, as if the bodies could be called
<i>conductible</i>, or <i>conducible</i>, with respect to heat: I have
therefore ventured upon a slight alteration of the word, and have used
the abstract term which analogy would suggest, if we suppose bodies to
be <i>conductive</i> in this respect.</div>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.<i>&#8212;Verifications of the Doctrines of
Conduction and Radiation.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> interior and exterior
conductivity of bodies are numbers, which enter as elements, or
<i>coefficients</i>, into the mathematical calculations founded on the
doctrines of conduction and radiation. These <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page144">144</a></span> coefficients are to be determined for
each case by appropriate experiments: when the experimenters had
obtained these data, as well as the mathematical solutions of the
problems, they could test the truth of their fundamental principles by
a comparison of the theoretical and actual results in
properly-selected cases. This was done for the law of conduction in
the simple cases of metallic bars heated at one end, by M. Biot,<a
id="fnanchor7-10" href="#note7-10"><span class="fnanchor">7</span></a>
and the accordance with experiment was sufficiently close. In the more
complex cases of conduction which Fourier considered, it was less easy
to devise a satisfactory mode of comparison. But some rather curious
relations which he demonstrated to exist among the temperatures at
different points of an <i>armille</i>, or ring, afforded a good
criterion of the value of the calculations, and confirmed their
correctness.<a id="fnanchor8-10" href="#note8-10"><span
class="fnanchor">8</span></a></p>

<p>We may therefore presume these doctrines of radiation and
conduction to be sufficiently established; and we may consider their
application to any remarkable case to be a portion of the history of
science. We proceed to some such applications.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 4.&#8212;<i>The Geological and Cosmological
Application of Thermotics.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">By</span> far the most important
case to which conclusions from these doctrines have been applied, is
that of the globe of the earth, and of those laws of climate to which
the modifications of temperature give rise; and in this way we are led
to inferences concerning other parts of the universe. If we had any
means of observing these terrestrial and cosmical phenomena to a
sufficient extent, they would be valuable facts on which we might
erect our theories; and they would thus form part, not of the
corollaries, but of the foundations of our doctrine of heat. In such a
case, the laws of the propagation of heat, as discovered from
experiments on smaller bodies, would serve to explain these phenomena
of the universe, just as the laws of motion explain the celestial
movements. But since we are almost entirely without any definite
indications of the condition of the other bodies in the solar system
as to heat; and since, even with regard to the earth, we know only the
temperature of the parts at or very near the surface, our knowledge of
the part which heat plays in the earth and the heavens must be in a
great measure, not a generalization of observed facts, but a deduction
from theoretical principles. Still, such knowledge, whether obtained
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page145">145</a></span> from
observation or from theory, must possess great interest and
importance. The doctrines of this kind which we have to notice refer
principally to the effect of the sun’s heat on the earth, the laws of
climate,&#8212;the thermotical condition of the interior of the
earth,&#8212;and that of the planetary spaces.</p>
<p>1. <i>Effect of Solar Heat on the Earth.</i>&#8212;That the sun’s
heat passes into the interior of the earth in a variable manner,
depending upon the succession of days and nights, summers and winters,
is an obvious consequence of our first notions on this subject. The
mode in which it proceeds into the interior, after descending below
the surface, remained to be gathered, either from the phenomena, or
from reasoning. Both methods were employed.<a id="fnanchor9-10"
href="#note9-10"><span class="fnanchor">9</span></a> Saussure
endeavored to trace its course by digging, in 1785, and thus found
that at the depth of about thirty-one feet, the annual variation of
temperature is about <span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub></span>th what it is at the
surface. Leslie adopted a better method, sinking the bulbs of
thermometers deep in the earth, while their stems appeared above the
surface. In 1813, ’16, and ’17, he observed thus the temperatures at
the depths of one, two, four, and eight feet, at Abbotshall, in
Fifeshire. The results showed that the extreme annual oscillations of
the temperature diminish as we descend. At the depth of one foot, the
yearly range of oscillation was twenty-five degrees (Fahrenheit); at
two feet it was twenty degrees; at four feet it was fifteen degrees;
at eight feet it was only nine degrees and a half. And the time at
which the heat was greatest was later and later in proceeding to the
lower points. At one foot, the maximum and minimum were three weeks
after the solstice of summer and of winter; at two feet, they were
four or five weeks; at four feet, they were two months; and at eight
feet, three months. The mean temperature of all the thermometers was
nearly the same. Similar results were obtained by Ott at Zurich in
1762, and by Herrenschneider at Strasburg in 1821, ’2, ’3.<a

<p>These results had already been explained by Fourier’s theory of
conduction. He had shown<a id="fnanchor11-10" href="#note11-10"><span
class="fnanchor">11</span></a> that when the surface of a sphere is
affected by a periodical heat, certain alternations of heat travel
uniformly into the interior, but that the extent of the alternation
diminishes in geometrical progression in this descent. This conclusion
applies to the effect of days and years on the temperature of the
earth, and shows that such facts as those observed by Leslie are both
exemplifications of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page146">146</a></span> the general circumstances of the earth,
and are perfectly in accordance with the principles on which Fourier’s
theory rests.</p>

(published 1826), p. 162.</div>
<p>2. <i>Climate.</i>&#8212;The term <i>climate</i>, which means
<i>inclination</i>, was applied by the ancients to denote that
inclination of the axis of the terrestrial sphere from which result
the inequalities of days in different latitudes. This inequality is
obviously connected also with a difference of thermotical condition.
Places near the poles are colder, on the whole, than places near the
equator. It was a natural object of curiosity to determine the law of
this variation.</p>
<p>Such a determination, however, involves many difficulties, and the
settlement of several preliminary points. How is the temperature of
any place to be estimated? and if we reply, by its <i>mean</i>
temperature, how are we to learn this mean? The answers to such
questions require very multiplied observations, exact instruments, and
judicious generalizations; and cannot be given here. But certain first
approximations may be obtained without much difficulty; for instance,
the mean temperature of any place may be taken to be the temperature
of deep springs, which is probably identical with the temperature of
the soil below the reach of the annual oscillations. Proceeding on
such facts, Mayer found that the mean temperature of any place was
nearly proportional to the square of the cosine of the latitude. This,
as a law of phenomena, has since been found to require considerable
correction; and it appears that the mean temperature does not depend
on the latitude alone, but on the distribution of land and water, and
on other causes. M. de Humboldt has expressed these deviations<a
id="fnanchor12-10" href="#note12-10"><span
class="fnanchor">12</span></a> by his map of <i>isothermal lines</i>,
and Sir D. Brewster has endeavored to reduce them to a law by assuming
two <i>poles of maximum cold</i>.</p>

<p>The expression which Fourier finds<a id="fnanchor13-10"
href="#note13-10"><span class="fnanchor">13</span></a> for the
distribution of heat in a homogeneous sphere, is not immediately
comparable with Mayer’s empirical formula, being obtained on a certain
hypothesis, namely, that the equator is kept constantly at a fixed
temperature. But there is still a general agreement; for, according to
the theory, there is a diminution of heat in proceeding from the
equator to the poles in such a case; the heat is propagated from the
equator and the neighboring parts, and radiates out from the poles
into the surrounding space. And thus, in the case of the earth, the
solar heat enters in the tropical <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page147">147</a></span> parts, and constantly flows towards the
polar regions, by which it is emitted into the planetary spaces.</p>

<p>Climate is affected by many thermotic influences, besides the
conduction and radiation of the solid mass of the earth. The
atmosphere, for example, produces upon terrestrial temperatures
effects which it is easy to see are very great; but these it is not
yet in the power of calculation to appreciate;<a id="fnanchor14-10"
href="#note14-10"><span class="fnanchor">14</span></a> and it is clear
that they depend upon other properties of air besides its power to
transmit heat. We must therefore dismiss them, at least for the
present.</p>

<p>3. <i>Temperature of the Interior of the Earth.</i>&#8212;The
question of the temperature of the interior of the earth has excited
great interest, in consequence of its bearing on other branches of
knowledge. The various facts which have been supposed to indicate the
fluidity of the central parts of the terrestrial globe, belong, in
general, to geological science; but so far as they require the light
of thermotical calculations in order to be rightly reasoned upon, they
properly come under our notice here.</p>
<p>The principal problem of this kind which has been treated of is
this:&#8212;If in the globe of the earth there be a certain original
heat, resulting from its earlier condition, and independent of the
action of the sun, to what results will this give rise? and how far do
the observed temperatures of points below the surface lead us to such
a supposition? It has, for instance, been asserted, that in many parts
of the world the temperature, as observed in mines and other
excavations, increases in descending, at the rate of one degree
(centesimal) in about forty yards. What inference does this
justify?</p>
<p>The answer to this question was given by Fourier and by Laplace.
The former mathematician had already considered the problem of the
cooling of a large sphere, in his Memoirs of 1807, 1809, and 1811.
These, however, lay unpublished in the archives of the Institute for
many years. But in 1820, when the accumulation of observations which
indicated an increase of the temperature of the earth as we descend,
had drawn observation to the subject, Fourier gave, in the Bulletin of
the Philomathic Society,<a id="fnanchor15-10" href="#note15-10"><span
class="fnanchor">15</span></a> a summary of his results, as far as
they bore on this point. His conclusion was, that such an increase of
temperature in proceeding towards the centre of the earth, can arise
from nothing but the remains of a primitive heat;&#8212;that the heat
which the sun’s action would communicate, would, in its final and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page148">148</a></span> permanent
state, be uniform in the same vertical line, as soon as we get beyond
the influence of the superficial oscillations of which we have
spoken;&#8212;and that, before the distribution of temperature reaches
this limit, it will decrease, not increase, in descending. It appeared
also, by the calculation, that this remaining existence of the
primitive heat in the interior of the earth’s mass, was quite
consistent with the absence of all perceptible traces of it at the
surface; and that the same state of things which produces an increase
of one degree of heat in descending forty yards, does not make the
surface a quarter of a degree hotter than it would otherwise be.
Fourier was led also to some conclusions, though necessarily very
vague ones, respecting the time which the earth must have taken to
cool from a supposed original state of incandescence to its present
condition, which time it appeared must have been very great; and
respecting the extent of the future cooling of the surface, which it
was shown must be insensible. Everything tended to prove that, within
the period which the history of the human race embraces, no
discoverable change of temperature had taken place from the progress
of this central cooling. Laplace further calculated the effect<a
id="fnanchor16-10" href="#note16-10"><span
class="fnanchor">16</span></a> which any contraction of the globe of
the earth by cooling would produce on the length of the day. He had
already shown, by astronomical reasoning, that the day had not become
shorter by <span style="font-size:
80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>200</sub></span>th of a second, since the
time of Hipparchus; and thus his inferences agreed with those of
Fourier. As far as regards the smallness of the perceptible effect due
to the past changes of the earth’s temperature, there can be no doubt
that all the curious conclusions just stated are deduced in a manner
quite satisfactory, from the fact of a general increase of heat in
descending below the surface of the earth; and thus our principles of
speculative science have a bearing upon the history of the past
changes of the universe, and give us information concerning the state
of things in portions of time otherwise quite out of our reach.</p>

<p>4. <i>Heat of the Planetary Spaces.</i>&#8212;In the same manner,
this portion of science is appealed to for information concerning
parts of space which are utterly inaccessible to observation. The
doctrine of heat leads to conclusions concerning the temperatures of
the spaces which surround the earth, and in which the planets of the
solar system revolve. In his Memoir, published in 1827,<a
id="fnanchor17-10" href="#note17-10"><span
class="fnanchor">17</span></a> Fourier states that he conceives it to
follow from his principles, that these planetary spaces <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page149">149</a></span> are not absolutely
cold, but have a “proper heat” independent of the sun and of the
planets. If there were not such a heat, the cold of the polar regions
would be much more intense than it is, and the alternations of cold
and warmth, arising from the influence of the sun, would be far more
extreme and sudden than we find them. As the cause of this heat in the
planetary spaces, he assigns the radiation of the innumerable stars
which are scattered through the universe.</p>

<p>In speaking of this subject, I have been led to notice incomplete
and perhaps doubtful applications of the mathematical doctrine of
conduction and radiation. But this may at least serve to show that
Thermotics is a science, which, like Mechanics, is to be established
by experiments on masses capable of manipulation, but which, like
that, has for its most important office the solution of geological and
cosmological problems. I now return to the further progress of our
thermotical knowledge.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 5.&#8212;<i>Correction of Newton’s Law of
Cooling.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">In</span> speaking of the
establishment of Newton’s assumption, that the temperature
communicated is proportional to the excess of temperature, we stated
that it was approximately verified, and afterwards corrected (chap.
i., <a href="#v2page139">sect. 1.</a>)<span class="correction"
title="emended from ,">.</span> This correction was the result of the
researches of MM. Dulong and Petit in 1817, and the researches by
which they were led to the true law, are an admirable example both of
laborious experiment and sagacious induction. They experimented
through a very great range of temperature (as high as two hundred and
forty degrees centigrade), which was necessary because the inaccuracy
of Newton’s law becomes considerable only at high temperatures. They
removed the effect of the surrounding medium, by making their
experiments in a vacuum. They selected with great <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page150">150</a></span> judgment the
conditions of their experiments and comparisons, making one quantity
vary while the others remained constant. In this manner they found,
that <i>the quickness of cooling for a constant excess of temperature,
increases in geometrical progression, when the temperature of the
surrounding space increases in arithmetical progression</i>; whereas,
according to the Newtonian law, this quickness would not have varied
at all. Again, this variation being left out of the account, it
appeared that <i>the quickness of cooling, so far as it depends on the
excess of temperature of the hot body, increases as the terms of a
geometrical progression diminished by a constant number, when the
temperature of the hot body increases in arithmetical progression</i>.
These two laws, with the coefficients requisite for their application
to particular substances, fully determine the conditions of cooling in
a vacuum.</p>
<p>Starting from this determination, MM. Dulong and Petit proceeded to
ascertain the effect of the medium, in which the hot body is placed,
upon its rate of cooling; for this effect became a <i>residual
phenomenon</i>,<a id="fnanchor20-10" href="#note20-10"><span
class="fnanchor">20</span></a> when the cooling in the vacuum was
taken away. We shall not here follow this train of research; but we
may briefly state, that they were led to such laws as this;&#8212;that
the rapidity of cooling due to any gaseous medium in which the body is
placed, is the same, so long as the excess of the body’s temperature
is the same, although the temperature itself vary;&#8212;that the
cooling power of a gas varies with the elasticity, according to a
determined law; and other similar rules.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note20-10"
href="#fnanchor20-10">20</a></span> See <i>Phil. Ind. Sciences</i>, B.
xiii. c. 7, Sect. iv.</div>
<p>In reference to the process of their induction, it is worthy of
notice, that they founded their reasonings upon Prevost’s law of
exchanges; and that, in this way, the second of their laws above
stated, respecting the quickness of cooling, was a mathematical
consequence of the first. It may be observed also, that their
temperatures are measured by means of the air-thermometer, and that if
they were estimated on another scale, the remarkable simplicity and
symmetry of their results would disappear. This is a strong argument
for believing such a measure of temperature to have a natural
prerogative of simplicity. This belief is confirmed by other
considerations; but these, depending on the laws of <em>expansion</em> by heat,
cannot be here referred to; and we must proceed to finish our survey
of the mathematical theory of heat, as founded on the phenomena of
radiation and conduction, which alone have as yet been traced up to
general principles.</p>
<p>We may observe, before we quit this subject, that this correction
of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page151">151</a></span> Newton’s law
will materially affect the mathematical calculations on the subject,
which were made to depend on that law both by Fourier, Laplace, and
Poisson. Probably, however, the general features of the results will
be the same as on the old supposition. M. Libri, an Italian
mathematician, has undertaken one of the problems of this kind, that
of the armil, with Dulong and Petit’s law for his basis, in a Memoir
read to the Institute of France in 1825, and since published at
Florence.<a id="fnanchor21-10" href="#note21-10"><span

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 6.&#8212;<i>Other Laws of Phenomena with respect to
Radiation.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> laws of radiation as
depending upon the surface of radiating bodies, and as affecting
screens of various kinds interposed between the hot body and the
thermometer, were examined by several inquirers. I shall not attempt
to give an account of the latter course of research, and of the
different laws which luminous and non-luminous heat have been found to
follow in reference to bodies, whether transparent or opaque, which
intercept them. But there are two or three laws of the phenomena,
depending upon the effects of the surfaces of bodies, which are
important.</p>
<p>1. In the first place, the powers of bodies to <i>emit</i> and to
<i>absorb</i> heat, as far as depends upon their surface, appear to be
in the same proportion. If we blacken the surface of a canister of hot
water, it radiates heat more copiously; and in the same measure, it is
more readily heated by radiation.</p>
<p>2. In the next place, as the radiative power increases, the power
of reflection diminishes, and the contrary. A bright metal vessel
reflects much heat; on this very account it does not emit much; and
hence a hot fluid which such a vessel contains, remains hot longer
than it does in an unpolished case.</p>
<p>3. The heat is emitted from every point of the surface of a hot
body in all directions; but by no means in all directions with equal
intensity. The intensity of the heating ray is as the sine of the
angle which it makes with the surface.</p>
<p>The last law is entirely, the two former in a great measure, due to
the researches of Leslie, whose <i>Experimental Inquiry into the
Nature and Propagation of Heat</i>, published in 1804, contains a
great number of curious and striking results and speculations. The
laws now just <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page152">152</a></span>
stated bear, in a very important manner, upon the formation of the
theory; and we must now proceed to consider what appears to have been
done in this respect; taking into account, it must still be borne in
mind, only the phenomena of conduction and radiation.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 7.&#8212;<i>Fourier’s Theory of Radiant
Heat.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> above laws of phenomena
being established, it was natural that philosophers should seek to
acquire some conception of the physical action by which they might
account, both for these laws, and for the general fundamental facts of
Thermotics; as, for instance, the fact that all bodies placed in an
inclosed space assume, in time, the temperature of the inclosure.
Fourier’s explanation of this class of phenomena must be considered as
happy and successful; for he has shown that the supposition to which
we are led by the most simple and general of the facts, will explain,
moreover, the less obvious laws. It is an obvious and general fact,
that bodies which are included in the space tend to acquire the same
temperature. And this identity of temperature of neighboring bodies
requires an hypothesis, which, it is found, also accounts for Leslie’s
law of the sine, in radiation.</p>
<p>This hypothesis is, that the radiation takes place, not from the
surface alone of the hot body, but from all particles situated within
a certain small depth of the surface. It is easy to see<a
id="fnanchor22-10" href="#note22-10"><span
class="fnanchor">22</span></a> that, on this supposition, a ray
emitted obliquely from an internal particle, will be less intense than
one sent forth perpendicular to the surface, because the former will
be intercepted in a greater degree, having a greater length of path
within the body; and Fourier shows, that whatever be the law of this
intercepting power, the result will be, that the radiative intensity
is as the sine of the angle made by the ray with the surface.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note22-10"
href="#fnanchor22-10">22</a></span> <i>Mém. Inst.</i> t. v. 1821, p.
204.</div>
<p>But this law is, as I have said, likewise necessary, in order that
neighboring bodies may tend to assume the same temperature: for
instance, in order that a small particle placed within a spherical
shell, should finally assume the temperature of the shell. If the law
of the sines did not obtain, the final temperature of such a particle
would depend upon its place in the inclosure;<a id="fnanchor23-10"
href="#note23-10"><span class="fnanchor">23</span></a> and within a
shell of ice we should have, at certain points, the temperature of
boiling water and of melting iron.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note23-10"
href="#fnanchor23-10">23</a></span> <i>An. Chim.</i> iv. 1817, p.
129.</div>
<p>This proposition may at first appear strange and unlikely; but it
may <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page153">153</a></span> be shown to
be a necessary consequence of the assumed principle, by very simple
reasoning, which I shall give in a general form in a Note.<a
id="fnanchor24-10" href="#note24-10"><span
class="fnanchor">24</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note24-10"
href="#fnanchor24-10">24</a></span> The following reasoning may show
the connexion of the law of the sines in radiant heat with the general
principle of ultimate identity of neighboring temperatures. The
equilibrium and identity of temperature between an including shell and
an included body, cannot obtain upon the whole, except it obtain
between each pair of parts of the two surfaces of the body and of the
shell; that is, any part of the one surface, in its exchanges with any
part of the other surface, must give and receive the same quantity of
heat. Now the quantity exchanged, so far as it depends on the
receiving surface, will, by geometry, be proportional to the sine of
the obliquity of that surface: and as, in the exchanges, each may be
considered as receiving, the quantity transferred must be proportional
to the sines of the two obliquities; that is, to that of the giving as
well as of the receiving surface.<br />
&#8195;Nor is this conclusion disturbed by the consideration, that all
the rays of heat which fall upon a surface are not absorbed, some
being reflected according to the nature of the surface. For, by the
other above-mentioned laws of phenomena, we know that, in the same
measure in which the surface loses the power of admitting, it loses
the power of emitting, heat; and the superficial parts gain, by
absorbing their own radiation, as much as they lose by not absorbing
the incident heat; so that the result of the preceding reasoning
remains unaltered.</div>
<p>This reasoning is capable of being
presented in a manner quite satisfactory, by the use of mathematical
symbols, and proves that Leslie’s law of the sines is rigorously and
mathematically true on Fourier’s hypothesis. And thus Fourier’s theory
of <i>molecular extra-radiation</i> acquires great consistency.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 8.&#8212;<i>Discovery of the Polarization of
Heat.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> laws of which the
discovery is stated in the preceding Sections of this Chapter, and the
explanations given of them by the theories of conduction and
radiation, all tended to make the conception of a material heat, or
<i>caloric</i>, communicated by an actual flow and emission, familiar
to men’s minds; and, till lately, had led the greater part of
thermotical philosophers to entertain such a view, as the most
probable opinion concerning the nature of heat. But some steps have
recently been made in thermotics, which appear to be likely to
overturn this belief, and to make the doctrine of emission as
untenable with regard to heat, as it had been found to be with regard
to light. I speak of the discovery of the polarization of heat. It
being ascertained that rays of heat are polarized in the same manner
as rays of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page154">154</a></span>
light, we cannot retain the doctrine that heat radiates by the
emanation of material particles, without supposing those particles of
caloric to have poles; an hypothesis which probably no one would
embrace; for, besides that the ill fortune which attended that
hypothesis in the case of light must deter speculators from it, the
intimate connexion of heat and light would hardly allow us to suppose
polarization in the two cases to be produced by two different kinds of
machinery.</p>
<p>But, without here tracing further the influence which the
polarization of heat must exercise upon the formation of our theories
of heat, we must briefly notice this important discovery, as a law of
phenomena.</p>
<p>The analogies and connexions between light and heat are so strong,
that when the polarization of light had been discovered, men were
naturally led to endeavor to ascertain whether heat possessed any
corresponding property. But partly from the difficulty of obtaining
any considerable effect of heat separated from light, and partly from
the want of a thermometrical apparatus sufficiently delicate, these
attempts led, for some time, to no decisive result. M. Berard took up
the subject in 1813. He used Malus’s apparatus, and conceived that he
found heat to be polarized by reflection at the surface of glass, in
the same manner as light, and with the same circumstances.<a
id="fnanchor25-10" href="#note25-10"><span
class="fnanchor">25</span></a> But when Professor Powell, of Oxford, a
few years later (1830), repeated these experiments with a similar
apparatus, he found<a id="fnanchor26-10" href="#note26-10"><span
class="fnanchor">26</span></a> that though the heat which is conveyed
along with light is, of course, polarizable, “simple radiant heat,” as
he terms it, did not offer the smallest difference in the two
rectangular azimuths of the second glass, and thus showed no trace of
polarization.</p>

1830, vol. ii. p. 303.</div>
<p>Thus, with the old thermometers, the point remained doubtful. But
soon after this time, MM. Melloni and Nobili invented an apparatus,
depending on certain galvanic laws, of which we shall have to speak
hereafter, which they called a <i>thermomultiplier</i>; and which was
much more sensitive to changes of temperature than any
previously-known instrument. Yet even with this instrument, M. Melloni
failed; and did not, at first, detect any perceptible polarization of
heat by the tourmaline;<a id="fnanchor27-10" href="#note27-10"><span
class="fnanchor">27</span></a> nor did M. Nobili,<a id="fnanchor28-10"
href="#note28-10"><span class="fnanchor">28</span></a> in repeating M.
Berard’s experiment. But in this experiment the attempt was made to
polarize heat by reflection from glass, as light is polarized: and the
quantity <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page155">155</a></span>
reflected is so small that the inevitable errors might completely
disguise the whole difference in the two opposite positions. When
Prof. Forbes, of Edinburgh, (in 1834,) employed mica in the like
experiments, he found a very decided polarizing effect; first, when
the heat was transmitted through several films of mica at a certain
angle, and afterwards, when it was reflected from them. In this case,
he found that with non-luminous heat, and even with the heat of water
below the boiling point, the difference of the heating power in the
two positions of opposite polarity (parallel and <i>crossed</i>) was
manifest. He also detected by careful experiments,<a
id="fnanchor29-10" href="#note29-10"><span
class="fnanchor">29</span></a> the polarizing effect of tourmaline.
This important discovery was soon confirmed by M. Melloni. Doubts were
suggested whether the different effect in the opposite positions might
not be due to other circumstances; but Professor Forbes easily showed
that these suppositions were inadmissible; and the property of a
difference of <i>sides</i>, which at first seemed so strange when
ascribed to the rays of light, also belongs, it seems to be proved, to
the rays of heat. Professor Forbes also found, by interposing a plate
of mica to intercept the ray of heat in an intermediate point, an
effect was produced in certain positions of the mica analogous to what
was called <i>depolarization</i> in the case of light; namely, a
partial destruction of the differences which polarization
establishes.</p>

p. 349.</div>
<p>Before this discovery, M. Melloni had already proved by experiment
that heat is <i>refracted</i> by transparent substances as light is.
In the case of light, the <i>depolarizing</i> effect was afterwards
found to be really, as we have seen, a <i>dipolarizing</i> effect, the
ray being divided into two rays by <i>double refraction</i>. We are
naturally much tempted to put the same interpretation upon the
dipolarizing effect in the case of heat; but perhaps the assertion of
the analogy between light and heat to this extent is as yet
insecure.</p>
<p>It is the more necessary to be cautious in our attempt to identify
the laws of light and heat, inasmuch as along with all the
resemblances of the two agents, there are very important differences.
The power of transmitting light, <i>the diaphaneity</i> of bodies, is
very distinct from their power of transmitting heat, which has been
called <i>diathermancy</i> by M. Melloni. Thus both a plate of alum
and a plate of rock-salt transmit nearly the whole light; but while
the first stops nearly the whole heat, the second stops very little of
it; and a plate of opake <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page156">156</a></span> quartz, nearly impenetrable by light,
allows a large portion of the heat to pass. By passing the rays
through various media, the heat may be, as it were, <em>sifted</em>
from the light which accompanies it.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [The diathermancy of bodies is distinct from their
diaphaneity, in so far that the same bodies do not exercise the same
powers of selection and suppression of certain rays on heat and on
light; but it appears to be proved by the investigations of modern
thermotical philosophers (MM. De la Roche, Powell, Melloni, and
Forbes), that there is a close analogy between the absorption of
certain colors by transparent bodies, and the absorption of certain
kinds of heat by diathermanous bodies. Dark sources of heat emit rays
which are analogous to blue and violet rays of light; and highly
luminous sources emit rays which are analogous to red rays. And by
measuring the angle of total reflection for heat of different kinds,
it has been shown that the former kind of calorific rays are really
less refrangible than the latter.<a id="fnanchor30-10"

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note30-10"
href="#fnanchor30-10">30</a></span> See Prof. Forbes’s <i>Third Series
of Researches on Heat</i>, <i>Edinb. R.S. Trans.</i> vol. xiv.</div>
<p>M. Melloni has assumed this analogy as so completely established,
that he has proposed for this part of thermotics the name
<i>Thermochroology</i> (Qu. <i>Chromothermotics</i>?); and along with
this term, many others derived from the Greek, and founded on the same
analogy. If it should appear, in the work which he proposes to publish
on this subject, that the doctrines which he has to state cannot
easily be made intelligible without the use of the terms he suggests,
his nomenclature will obtain currency; but so large a mass of
etymological innovations is in general to be avoided in scientific
works.</p>
<p>M. Melloni’s discovery of the extraordinary power of
<i>rock-salt</i> to transmit heat, and Professor Forbes’s discovery of
the extraordinary power of <i>mica</i> to polarize and depolarize
heat, have supplied thermotical inquirers with two new and most
valuable instruments.<a id="fnanchor31-10" href="#note31-10"><span

<p>Moreover, besides the laws of conduction and radiation, many other
laws of the phenomena of heat have been discovered by philosophers;
and these must be taken into account in judging any theory of heat. To
these other laws we must now turn our attention. <span

<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Expansion by Heat.&#8212;The
Law of Dalton and Gay-Lussac for Gases.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">ALMOST</span> all bodies expand by
heat; solids, as metals, in a small degree; fluids, as water, oil,
alcohol, mercury, in a greater degree. This was one of the facts first
examined by those who studied the nature of heat, because this
property was used for the measure of heat. In the <i>Philosophy of the
Inductive Sciences</i>, Book iv., Chap. iv., I have stated that
secondary qualities, such as Heat, must be measured by their effects:
and in Sect. 4 of that Chapter I have given an account of the
successive attempts which have been made to obtain measures of heat. I
have there also spoken of the results which were obtained by comparing
the rate at which the expansion of different substances went on, under
the same degrees of heat; or as it was called, the different
<i>thermometrical march</i> of each substance. Mercury appears to be
the liquid which is most uniform in its thermometrical march; and it
has been taken as the most common material of our thermometers; but
the expansion of mercury is not proportional to the heat. De Luc was
led, by his experiments, to conclude “that the dilatations of mercury
follow an accelerated march for equal augmentations of heat.” Dalton
conjectured that water and mercury both expand as the square of the
<i>real temperature</i> from the point of greatest contraction: the
real temperature being measured so as to lead to such a result. But
none of the rules thus laid down for the expansion of solids and
fluids appear to have led, as yet, to any certain general laws.</p>
<p>With regard to gases, thermotical inquirers have been more
successful. Gases expand by heat; and their expansion is governed by a
law which applies alike to all degrees of heat, and to all gaseous
fluids. The law is this: that <i>for equal increments of temperature
they expand by the same fraction of their own bulk</i>; which fraction
is <i>three-eights</i> <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page158">158</a></span> in proceeding from freezing to boiling
water. This law was discovered by Dalton and M. Gay-Lussac
independently of each other;<a id="fnanchor32-10"
href="#note32-10"><span class="fnanchor">32</span></a> and is usually
called by both their names, <i>the law of Dalton and Gay-Lussac</i>.
The latter says,<a id="fnanchor33-10" href="#note33-10"><span
class="fnanchor">33</span></a> “The experiments which I have
described, and which have been made with great care, prove
incontestably that oxygen, hydrogen, azotic acid, nitrous acid,
ammoniacal acid, muriatic acid, sulphurous acid, carbonic acid, gases,
expand equally by equal increments of heat.” “Therefore,” he adds with
a proper inductive generalization, “the result does not depend upon
physical properties, and I collect that <i>all gases expand equally by
heat</i>.” He then extends this to vapors, as ether. This must be one
of the most important foundation-stones of any sound theory of
heat.</p>

<p>[2nd Ed.] Yet MM. Magnus and Regnault conceive that they have
overthrown this law of Dalton and Gay-Lussac, and shown that the
different gases do not expand alike for the same increment of heat.
Magnus found the ratio to be for atmospheric air, 1∙366; for hydrogen,
1∙365; for carbonic acid, 1∙369; for sulphurous-acid gas, 1∙385. But
these differences are not greater than the differences obtained for
the same substances by different observers; and as this law is
referred to in Laplace’s hypothesis, <a
href="#fnanchor71-10">hereafter</a> to be discussed, I do not treat
the law as disproved.</p>
<p>Yet that the rate of expansion of gas in certain circumstances is
different for different substances, must be deemed very probable,

<p>We have <a href="#v2page150">already</a> seen that the opinion that
the air-thermometer is a true measure of heat, is strongly
countenanced by the symmetry which, by using it, we introduce into the
laws of radiation. If we <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page159">159</a></span> accept the law of Dalton and Gay-Lussac,
it follows that this result is independent of any peculiar properties
in the air employed; and thus this measure has an additional character
of generality and simplicity which make it still more probable that it
is the true standard. This opinion is further supported by the
attempts to include such facts in a theory; but before we can treat of
such theories, we must speak of some other doctrines which have been
introduced.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Specific Heat.&#8212;Change of
Consistence.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">In</span> the attempts to obtain
measures of heat, it was found that bodies had different capacities
for heat; for the same quantity of heat, however measured, would
raise, in different degrees, the temperature of different substances.
The notion of different capacities for heat was thus introduced, and
each body was thus assumed to have a specific <i>capacity for
heat</i>, according to the quantity of heat which it required to raise
it through a given scale of heat.<a id="fnanchor35-10"
href="#note35-10"><span class="fnanchor">35</span></a> The term
“capacity for heat” was introduced by Dr. Irvine, a pupil of Dr.
Black. For this term, Wilcke, the Swedish physicist, substituted
“specific heat;” in analogy with “specific gravity.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note35-10"
href="#fnanchor35-10">35</a></span> See Crawford, <i>On Heat</i>, for
the History of Specific Heat.</div>
<p>It was found, also, that the capacity of the same substance was
different in the same substance at different temperatures. It appears
from experiments of MM. Dulong and Petit, that, in general, the
capacity of liquids and solids increases as we ascend in the scale of
temperature.</p>
<p>But one of the most important thermotic facts is, that by the
sudden contraction of any mass, its temperature is increased. This is
peculiarly observable in gases, as, for example, common air. The
amount of the increase of temperature by sudden condensation, or of
the cold produced by sudden rarefaction, is an important datum,
determining the velocity of sound, as we have <a
href="#soundvelocity">already</a> seen, and affecting many points of
meteorology. The coefficient which enters the calculation in the
former case depends on the ratio of two specific heats of air under
different conditions; one belonging to it when, varying in density,
the pressure is constant by which the air is contained; the other,
when, varying in density, it is contained in a constant space.</p>
<p>A leading fact, also, with regard to the operation of heat on
bodies <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page160">160</a></span> is, that
it changes their <i>form</i>, as it is often called, that is, their
condition as solid, liquid, or air. Since the term “form” is employed
in too many and various senses to be immediately understood when it is
intended to convey this peculiar meaning, I shall use, instead of it,
the term <i>consistence</i>, and shall hope to be excused, even when I
apply this word to gases, though I must acknowledge such phraseology
to be unusual. Thus there is a change of consistence when solids
become liquid, or liquids gaseous; and the laws of such changes must
be fundamental facts of our thermotical theories. We are still in the
dark as to many of the laws which belong to this change; but one of
them, of great importance, has been discovered, and to that we must
now proceed.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>The Doctrine of Latent Heat.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> Doctrine of Latent Heat
refers to such changes of consistence as we have just spoken of. It is
to this effect; that during the conversion of solids into liquids, or
of liquids into vapors, there is communicated to the body heat which
is not indicated by the thermometer. The heat is absorbed, or becomes
<i>latent</i>; and, on the other hand, on the condensation of the
vapor to a liquid, or the liquid to a solid consistency, this heat is
again given out and becomes sensible. Thus a pound of ice requires
twenty times as long a time, in a warm room, to raise its temperature
seven degrees, as a pound of ice-cold water does. A kettle placed on a
fire, in four minutes had its temperature raised to the boiling point,
212°: and this temperature continued stationary for twenty minutes,
when the whole was boiled away. Dr. Black inferred from these facts
that a large quantity of heat is absorbed by the ice in becoming
water, and by the water in becoming steam. He reckoned from the above
experiments, that ice, in melting, absorbs as much heat as would raise
ice-cold water through 140° of temperature: and that water, in
evaporating, absorbs as much heat as would raise it through 940°.</p>
<p>That snow requires a great quantity of heat to melt it; that water
requires a great quantity of heat to convert it into steam; and that
this heat is not indicated by a rise in the thermometer, are facts
which it is not difficult to observe; but to separate these from all
extraneous conditions, to group the cases together, and to seize upon
the general law by which they are connected, was an effort of
inductive insight, which has been considered, and deservedly, as one
of the most striking <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page161">161</a></span> events in the modern history of physics.
Of this step the principal merit appears to belong to Black.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [In the first edition I had mentioned the names of De Luc
and of Wilcke, in connexion with the discovery of Latent Heat, along
with the name of Black. De Luc had observed, in 1755, that ice, in
melting, did not rise above the freezing-point of temperature till the
whole was melted. De Luc has been charged with plagiarizing Black’s
discovery, but, I think, without any just ground. In his <i>Idées sur
la Météorologique</i> (1787), he spoke of Dr. Black as “the first who
had attempted the determinations of the quantities of latent heat.”
And when Mr. Watt pointed out to him that from this expression it
might be supposed that Black had not discovered the fact itself, he
acquiesced, and redressed the equivocal expression in an Appendix to
the volume.<a id="fnanchor36-10" href="#note36-10"><span
class="fnanchor">36</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note36-10"
href="#fnanchor36-10">36</a></span> See his <i>Letter</i> to the
Editors of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, No. xii. p. 502, of the
<i>Review</i>.</div>
<p>Black never published his own account of the doctrine of Latent
Heat: but he delivered it every year after 1760 in his Lectures. In
1770, a surreptitious publication of his Lectures was made by a London
bookseller, and this gave a view of the leading points of Dr. Black’s
doctrine. In 1772, Wilcke, of Stockholm, read a paper to the Royal
Society of that city, in which the absorption of heat by melting ice
is described; and in the same year, De Luc of Geneva published his
<i>Recherches sur les Modifications de l’Atmosphère</i>, which has
been alleged to contain the doctrine of latent heat, and which the
author asserts to have been written in ignorance of what Black had
done. At a later period, De Luc, adopting, in part. Black’s
expression, gave the name of <i>latent fire</i> to the heat
absorbed.<a id="fnanchor37-10" href="#note37-10"><span

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note37-10"

20.</div>
<p>It appears that Cavendish determined the amount of heat produced by
condensing steam, and by thawing snow, as early as 1765. He had
perhaps already heard something of Black’s investigations, but did not
accept his term “latent heat”.<span class="correction" title="footnote

<p>The consequences of Black’s principle are very important, for upon
it is founded the whole doctrine of evaporation; besides which, the
principle of latent heat has other applications. But the relations of
aqueous vapor to air are so important, and have been so long a <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page162">162</a></span> subject of
speculation, that we may with advantage dwell a little upon them. The
part of science in which this is done may be called, as we have said,
Atmology; and to that division of Thermotics the following chapters
belong.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">The Relation of Vapor and Air.</span></h3>
<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>The Boylean Law of the Air’s
Elasticity.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IN</span> the Sixth Book (Chap. iv.
<a href="#v1page345">Sect. 1.</a>) we have already seen how the
conception on the laws of fluid equilibrium was, by Pascal and others,
extended to air, as well as water. But though air presses and is
pressed as water presses and is pressed, pressure produces upon air an
effect which it does not, in any obvious degree, produce upon water.
Air which is pressed is also <em>compressed</em>, or made to occupy a
smaller space; and is consequently also made more dense, or
<i>condensed</i>; and on the other hand, when the pressure upon a
portion of air is diminished, the air expands or is rarefied. These
broad facts are evident. They are expressed in a general way by saying
that air is an <i>elastic</i> fluid, yielding in a certain degree to
pressure, and recovering its previous dimensions when the pressure is
removed.</p>
<p>But when men had reached this point, the questions obviously
offered themselves, in what degree and according to what law air
yields to pressure; when it is compressed, what relation does the
density bear to the pressure? The use which had been made of tubes
containing columns of mercury, by which the pressure of portions of
air was varied and measured, suggested obvious modes of devising
experiments by which this question might be answered. Such experiments
accordingly were made by Boyle about 1650; and the result at which he
arrived was, that when air is thus compressed, the density is as the
pressure. Thus if the pressure of the atmosphere in its common state
be equivalent to 30 inches of mercury, as shown by the barometer; if
air included in a tube be pressed by 30 additional inches of <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page164">164</a></span> mercury, its density
will be doubled, the air being compressed into one half the space. If
the pressure be increased threefold, the density is also trebled; and
so on. The same law was soon afterwards (in 1676) proved
experimentally by Mariotte. And this law of the air’s elasticity, that
the density is as the pressure, is sometimes called the <i>Boylean
Law</i>, and sometimes the <i>Law of Boyle and Mariotte</i>.</p>
<p>Air retains its aerial character permanently; but there are other
aerial substances which appear as such, and then disappear or change
into some other condition. Such are termed <i>vapors</i>. And the
discovery of their true relation to air was the result of a long
course of researches and speculations.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [It was found by M. Cagniard de la Tour (in 1823), that
at a certain temperature, a liquid, under sufficient pressure, becomes
clear transparent vapor or gas, having the same bulk as the liquid.
This condition Dr. Faraday calls the <i>Cagniard de la Tour</i> state,
(the <i>Tourian</i> state?) It was also discovered by Dr. Faraday that
carbonic-acid gas, and many other gases, which were long conceived to
be permanently elastic, are really reducible to a liquid state by
pressure.<a id="fnanchor39-10" href="#note39-10"><span
class="fnanchor">39</span></a> And in 1835, M. Thilorier found the
means of reducing liquid carbonic acid to a solid form, by means of
the cold produced in evaporation. More recently Dr. Faraday has added
several substances usually gaseous to the list of those which could
previously be shown in the liquid state, and has reduced others,
including ammonia, nitrous oxide, and sulphuretted hydrogen, to a
solid consistency.<a id="fnanchor40-10" href="#note40-10"><span
class="fnanchor">40</span></a> After these discoveries, we may, I
think, reasonably doubt whether all bodies are not capable of existing
in the three <i>consistencies</i> of solid, liquid, and air.</p>

href="#fnanchor40-10">40</a></span> Ib. Pt. 1. 1845.</div>
<p>We may note that the law of Boyle and Mariotte is not exactly true
near the limit at which the air passes to the liquid state in such
cases as that just spoken of. The diminution of bulk is then more
rapid than the increase of pressure.</p>
<p>The transition of fluids from a liquid to an airy consistence
appears to be accompanied by other curious phenomena. See Prof.
Forbes’s papers on the <i>Color of Steam under certain
circumstances</i>, and on the <i>Colors of the Atmosphere</i>, in the
<i>Edin. Trans.</i> vol. xiv.] <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page165">165</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Prelude to Dalton’s Doctrine of
Evaporation.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Visible</span> clouds, smoke,
distillation, gave the notion of Vapor; vapor was at first conceived
to be identical with air, as by Bacon.<a id="fnanchor41-10"
href="#note41-10"><span class="fnanchor">41</span></a> It was easily
collected, that by heat, water might be converted into vapor. It was
thought that air was thus produced, in the instrument called the
<i>æolipile</i>, in which a powerful blast is caused by a boiling
fluid; but Wolfe showed that the fluid was not converted into air, by
using camphorated spirit of wine, and condensing the vapor after it
had been formed. We need not enumerate the doctrines (if very vague
hypotheses may be so termed) of Descartes, Dechales, Borelli.<a
id="fnanchor42-10" href="#note42-10"><span
class="fnanchor">42</span></a> The latter accounted for the rising of
vapor by supposing it a mixture of fire and water; and thus, fire
being much lighter than air, the mixture also was light. Boyle
endeavored to show that vapors do not permanently float <i>in
vacuo</i>. He compared the mixture of vapor with air to that of salt
with water. He found that the pressure of the atmosphere affected the
heat of boiling water; a very important fact. Boyle proved this by
means of the air-pump; and he and his friends were much surprised to
find that when air was removed, water only just warm boiled violently.
Huyghens mentions an experiment of the same kind made by Papin about
1673.</p>

<i>Geschichte der Physik</i>, vol. ii. p. 175.</div>
<p>The ascent of vapor was explained in various ways in succession,
according to the changes which physical science underwent. It was a
problem distinctly treated of, at a period when hydrostatics had
accounted for many phenomena; and attempts were naturally made to
reduce this fact to hydrostatical principles. An obvious hypothesis,
which brought it under the dominion of these principles, was, to
suppose that the water, when converted into vapor, was divided into
small hollow globules;&#8212;thin pellicles including air or heat.
Halley gave such an explanation of evaporation; Leibnitz calculated
the dimensions of these little bubbles; Derham managed (as he
supposed) to examine them with a magnifying glass: Wolfe also examined
and calculated on the same subject. It is curious to see so much
confidence in so lame a theory; for if water became hollow globules in
order to rise as vapor, we require, in order to explain the formation
of these globules, new laws of nature, which are not even hinted at by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page166">166</a></span> the supporters
of the doctrine, though they must be far more complex than the
hydrostatical law by which a hollow sphere floats.</p>
<p>Newton’s opinion was hardly more satisfactory; he<a
id="fnanchor43-10" href="#note43-10"><span
class="fnanchor">43</span></a> explained evaporation by the repulsive
power of heat; the parts of vapors, according to him, being small, are
easily affected by this force, and thus become lighter than the
atmosphere.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note43-10"
href="#fnanchor43-10">43</a></span> <i>Opticks</i>, Qu. 31.</div>
<p>Muschenbroek still adhered to the theory of globules, as the
explanation of evaporation; but he was manifestly discontented with
it; and reasonably apprehended that the pressure of the air would
destroy the frail texture of these bubbles. He called to his aid a
rotation of the globules (which Descartes also had assumed); and, not
satisfied with this, threw himself on electrical action as a reserve.
Electricity, indeed, was now in favor, as hydrostatics had been
before; and was naturally called in, in all cases of difficulty.
Desaguliers, also, uses this agent to account for the ascent of vapor,
introducing it into a kind of sexual system of clouds; according to
him, the male fire (heat) does a part, and the female fire
(electricity) performs the rest. These are speculations of small merit
and no value.</p>
<p>In the mean time, Chemistry made great progress in the estimation
of philosophers, and had its turn in the explanation of the important
facts of evaporation. Bouillet, who, in 1742, placed the particles of
water in the interstices of those of air, may be considered as
approaching to the chemical theory. In 1748, the Academy of Sciences
of Bourdeaux proposed the ascent of vapors as the subject of a prize;
which was adjudged in a manner very impartial as to the choice of a
theory; for it was divided between Kratzenstein, who advocated the
bubbles, (the coat of which he determined to be <span
style="font-size: 80%"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>50,000</sub></span>th
of an inch thick,) and Hamberger, who maintained the truth to be the
adhesion of particles of water to those of air and fire. The latter
doctrine had become much more distinct in the author’s mind when seven
years afterwards (1750) he published his <i>Elementa Physices</i>. He
then gave the explanation of evaporation in a phrase which has since
been adopted,&#8212;the <i>solution of water in air</i>; which he
conceived to be of the same kind as other chemical solutions.</p>
<p>This theory of solution was further advocated and developed by Le
Roi;<a id="fnanchor44-10" href="#note44-10"><span
class="fnanchor">44</span></a> and in his hands assumed a form which
has been extensively adopted up to our times, and has, in many
instances, tinged the language commonly used. He conceived that air,
like other solvents, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page167">167</a></span> might be <i>saturated</i>; and that when
the water was beyond the amount required for saturation, it appeared
in a visible form. The saturating quantity was held to depend mainly
on warmth and wind.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note44-10"
href="#fnanchor44-10">44</a></span> <i>Ac. R. Sc.</i> Paris,
1750.</div>
<p>This theory was by no means devoid of merit; for it brought
together many of the phenomena, and explained a number of the
experiments which Le Roi made. It explained the facts of the
transparency of vapor, (for perfect solutions are transparent,) the
precipitation of water by cooling, the disappearance of the visible
moisture by warming it again, the increased evaporation by rain and
wind; and other observed phenomena. So far, therefore, the
introduction of the notion of the chemical solution of water in air
was apparently very successful. But its defects are of a very fatal
kind; for it does not at all apply to the facts which take place when
air is excluded.</p>
<p>In Sweden, in the mean time,<a id="fnanchor45-10"
href="#note45-10"><span class="fnanchor">45</span></a> the subject had
been pursued in a different, and in a more correct manner. Wallerius
Ericsen had, by various experiments, established the important fact,
that water evaporates in a <i>vacuum</i>. His experiments are clear
and satisfactory; and he inferred from them the falsity of the common
explanation of evaporation by the solution of water in <em>air</em>.
His conclusions are drawn in a very intelligent manner. He considers
the question whether water can be changed into air, and whether the
atmosphere is, in consequence, a mere collection of vapors; and on
good reasons, decides in the negative, and concludes the existence of
permanently-elastic air different from vapor. He judges, also, that
there are two causes concerned, one acting to produce the first ascent
of vapors, the other to support them afterwards. The first, which acts
in a vacuum, he conceives to be the mutual repulsion of the particles;
and since this force is independent of the presence of other
substances, this seems to be a sound induction. When the vapors have
once ascended into the air, it may readily be granted that they are
carried higher, and driven from side to side by the currents of the
atmosphere. Wallerius conceives that the vapor will rise till it gets
into air of the same density as itself, and being then in equilibrium,
will drift to and fro.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note45-10"
href="#fnanchor45-10">45</a></span> Fischer, <i>Gesch. Phys.</i> vol.
v. p. 63.</div>
<p>The two rival theories of evaporation, that of <i>chemical
solution</i> and that of <i>independent vapor</i>, were, in various
forms, advocated by the next generation of philosophers. De Saussure
may be considered as the leader on one side, and De Luc on the other.
The former maintained the solution theory, with some modifications of
his own. De <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page168">168</a></span> Luc
denied all solution, and held vapor to be a combination of the
particles of water with fire, by which they became lighter than air.
According to him, there is always fire enough present to produce this
combination, so that evaporation goes on at all temperatures.</p>
<p>This mode of considering independent vapor as a combination of fire
with water, led the attention of those who adopted that opinion to the
thermometrical changes which take place when vapor is formed and
condensed. These changes are important, and their laws curious. The
laws belong to the induction of latent heat, of which we have just <a
href="#v2page160">spoken</a>; but a knowledge of them is not
absolutely necessary in order to enable us to understand the manner in
which steam exists in air.</p>
<p>De Luc’s views led him<a id="fnanchor46-10" href="#note46-10"><span
class="fnanchor">46</span></a> also to the consideration of the effect
of pressure on vapor. He explains the fact that pressure will condense
vapor, by supposing that it brings the particles within the distance
at which the repulsion arising from fire ceases. In this way, he also
explains the fact, that though external pressure does thus condense
steam, the mixture of a body of air, by which the pressure is equally
increased, will not produce the same effect; and therefore, vapors can
exist in the atmosphere. They make no fixed proportion of it; but at
the same temperature we have the same pressure arising <em>from
them</em>, whether they are in air or not. As the heat increases,
vapor becomes capable of supporting a greater and greater pressure,
and at the boiling heat, it can support the pressure of the
atmosphere.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note46-10"
href="#fnanchor46-10">46</a></span> Fischer, vol. vii. p. 453.
<i>Nouvelles Idées sur la Météorologie</i>, 1787.</div>
<p>De Luc also marked very precisely (as Wallerius had done) the
difference between vapor and air; the former being capable of change
of <i>consistence</i> by cold or pressure, the latter not so. Pictet,
in 1786, made a hygrometrical experiment, which appeared to him to
confirm De Luc’s views; and De Luc, in 1792, published a concluding
essay on the subject in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>.
Pictet’s <i>Essay on Fire</i>, in 1791, also demonstrated that “all
the train of hygrometrical phenomena takes place just as well, indeed
rather quicker, in a vacuum than in air, provided the same quantity of
moisture is present.” This essay, and De Luc’s paper, gave the
death-blow to the theory of the solution of water in air.</p>
<p>Yet this theory did not fall without an obstinate struggle. It was
taken up by the new school of French chemists, and connected with
their views of heat. Indeed, it long appears as the prevalent opinion.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page169">169</a></span> Girtanner,<a
id="fnanchor47-10" href="#note47-10"><span
class="fnanchor">47</span></a> in his <i>Grounds of the Antiphlogistic
Theory</i>, may be considered as one of the principal expounders of
this view of the matter. Hube, of Warsaw, was, however, the strongest
of the defenders of the theory of solution, and published upon it
repeatedly about 1790. Yet he appears to have been somewhat
embarrassed with the increase of the air’s elasticity by vapor.
Parrot, in 1801, proposed another theory, maintaining that De Luc had
by no means successfully attacked that of solution, but only De
Saussure’s superfluous additions to it.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note47-10"
href="#fnanchor47-10">47</a></span> Fischer, vol. vii. 473.</div>
<p>It is difficult to see what prevented the general reception of the
doctrine of independent vapor; since it explained all the facts very
simply, and the agency of air was shown over and over again to be
unnecessary. Yet, even now, the solution of water in air is hardly
exploded. M. Gay Lussac,<a id="fnanchor48-10" href="#note48-10"><span
class="fnanchor">48</span></a> in 1800, talks of the quantity of water
“held in solution” by the air; which, he says, varies according to its
temperature and density by a law which has not yet been discovered.
And Professor Robison, in the article “Steam,” in the <i>Encyclopædia
Britannica</i> (published about 1800), says,<a id="fnanchor49-10"
href="#note49-10"><span class="fnanchor">49</span></a> “Many
philosophers imagine that spontaneous evaporation, at low
temperatures, is produced in this way (by elasticity alone). But we
cannot be of this opinion; and must still think that this kind of
evaporation is produced by the dissolving power of the air.” He then
gives some reasons for his opinion. “When moist air is suddenly
rarefied, there is always a precipitation of water. But by this new
doctrine the very contrary should happen, because the tendency of
water to appear in the elastic form is promoted by removing the
external pressure.” Another main difficulty in the way of the doctrine
of the mere mixture of vapor and air was supposed to be this; that if
they were so mixed, the heavier fluid would take the lower part, and
the lighter the higher part, of the space which they occupied.</p>

<p>The former of these arguments was repelled by the consideration
that in the rarefaction of air, its specific heat is changed, and thus
its temperature reduced below the constituent temperature of the vapor
which it contains. The latter argument is answered by a reference to
Dalton’s law of the mixture of gases. We must consider the
establishment of this doctrine in a new section, as the most material
step to the true notion of evaporation. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page170">170</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Dalton’s Doctrine of
Evaporation.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">A portion</span> of that which
appears to be the true notion of evaporation was known, with greater
or less distinctness, to several of the physical philosophers of whom
we have spoken. They were aware that the vapor which exists in air, in
an invisible state, may be condensed into water by cold: and they had
noticed that, in any state of the atmosphere, there is a certain
temperature lower than that of the atmosphere, to which, if we depress
bodies, water forms upon them in fine drops like dew; this temperature
is thence called the <i>dew-point</i>. The vapor of water which exists
anywhere may be reduced below the degree of heat which is necessary to
constitute it vapor, and thus it ceases to be vapor. Hence this
temperature is also called the <i>constituent temperature</i>. This
was generally known to the meteorological speculators of the last
century, although, in England, attention was principally called to it
by Dr. Wells’s <i>Essay on Dew</i>, in 1814. This doctrine readily
explains how the cold produced by rarefaction of air, descending below
the constituent temperature of the contained vapor, may precipitate a
dew; and thus, as we have said, refutes one obvious objection to the
theory of independent vapor.</p>
<p>The other difficulty was first fully removed by Mr. Dalton. When
his attention was drawn to the subject of vapor, he saw insurmountable
objections to the doctrine of a chemical union of water and air. In
fact, this doctrine was a mere nominal explanation; for, on closer
examination, no chemical analogies supported it. After some
reflection, and in the sequel of other generalizations concerning
gases, he was led to the persuasion, that when air and steam are mixed
together, each follows its separate laws of equilibrium, the particles
of each being elastic with regard to those of their own kind only: so
that steam may be conceived as flowing among the particles of air<a
id="fnanchor50-10" href="#note50-10"><span
class="fnanchor">50</span></a> “like a stream of water among pebbles;”
and the resistance which air offers to evaporation arises, not from
its weight, but from the inertia of its particles.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note50-10"
href="#fnanchor50-10">50</a></span> <i>Manchester Memoirs</i>, vol. v.
p. 581.</div>
<p>It will be found that the theory of independent vapor, understood
with these conditions, will include all the facts of the
case;&#8212;gradual evaporation in air; sudden evaporation in a
vacuum; the increase of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page171">171</a></span> the air’s elasticity by vapor;
condensation by its various causes; and other phenomena.</p>
<p>But Mr. Dalton also made experiments to prove his fundamental
principle, that if two different gases communicate, they will diffuse
themselves through each other;<a id="fnanchor51-10"
href="#note51-10"><span class="fnanchor">51</span></a>&#8212;slowly,
if the opening of communication be small. He observes also, that all
the gases had equal solvent powers for vapor, which could hardly have
happened, had chemical affinity been concerned. Nor does the density
of the air make any difference.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note51-10"
href="#fnanchor51-10">51</a></span> <i>New System of Chemical
Philosophy</i>, vol. i. p. 151.</div>
<p>Taking all these circumstances into the account, Mr. Dalton
abandoned the idea of solution. “In the autumn of 1801,” he says, “I
hit upon an idea which seemed to be exactly calculated to explain the
phenomena of vapor: it gave rise to a great variety of experiments,”
which ended in fixing it in his mind as a true idea. “But,” he adds,
“the theory was almost universally misunderstood, and consequently
reprobated.”</p>
<p>Mr. Dalton answers various objections. Berthollet had urged that we
can hardly conceive the particles of an elastic substance added to
those of another, without increasing its elasticity. To this Mr.
Dalton replies by adducing the instance of magnets, which repel each
other, but do not repel other bodies. One of the most curious and
ingenious objections is that of M. Gough, who argues, that if each gas
is elastic with regard to itself alone, we should hear, produced by
one stroke, four sounds; namely, <i>first</i>, the sound through
aqueous vapor; <i>second</i>, the sound through azotic gas;
<i>third</i>, the sound through oxygen gas; <i>fourth</i>, the sound
through carbonic acid. Mr. Dalton’s answer is, that the difference of
time at which these sounds would come is very small; and that, in
fact, we do hear, sounds double and treble.</p>
<p>In his <i>New System of Chemical Philosophy</i>, Mr. Dalton
considers the objections of his opponents with singular candor and
impartiality. He there appears disposed to abandon that part of the
theory which negatives the mutual repulsion of the particles of the
two gases, and to attribute their diffusion through one another to the
different size of the particles, which would, he thinks,<a
id="fnanchor52-10" href="#note52-10"><span
class="fnanchor">52</span></a> produce the same effect.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note52-10"
href="#fnanchor52-10">52</a></span> <i>New System</i>, vol. i. p.
188.</div>
<p>In selecting, as of permanent importance, the really valuable part
of this theory, we must endeavor to leave out all that is doubtful or
unproved. I believe it will be found that in all theories hitherto
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page172">172</a></span> promulgated,
all assertions respecting the properties of the particles of bodies,
their sizes, distances, attractions, and the like, are insecure and
superfluous. Passing over, then, such hypotheses, the inductions which
remain are these;&#8212;that two gases which are in communication
will, by the elasticity of each, diffuse themselves in one another,
quickly or slowly; and&#8212;that the quantity of steam contained in a
certain space of air is the same, whatever be the air, whatever be its
density, and even if there be a vacuum. These propositions may be
included together by saying, that one gas is <i>mechanically mixed</i>
with another; and we cannot but assent to what Mr. Dalton says of the
latter fact,&#8212;“this is certainly the touchstone of the mechanical
and chemical theories.” This <i>doctrine of the mechanical mixture of
gases</i> appears to supply answers to all the difficulties opposed to
it by Berthollet and others, as Mr. Dalton has shown;<a
id="fnanchor53-10" href="#note53-10"><span
class="fnanchor">53</span></a> and we may, therefore, accept it as
well established.</p>

href="#fnanchor53-10">53</a></span> <i>New System</i>, vol. i. p. 160,
&amp;c.</div>
<p>This doctrine, along with the <i>principle of the constituent
temperature of steam</i>, is applicable to a large series of
meteorological and other consequences. But before considering the
applications of theory to natural phenomena, which have been made, it
will be proper to speak of researches which were carried on, in a
great measure, in consequence of the use of steam in the arts: I mean
the laws which connect its elastic force with its constituent
temperature.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 4.&#8212;<i>Determination of the Laws of the Elastic
Force of Steam.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> expansion of aqueous
vapor at different temperatures is governed, like that of all other
vapors, by the law of Dalton and Gay-Lussac, already mentioned; and
from this, its elasticity, when its expansion is resisted, will be
known by the law of Boyle and Mariotte; namely, by the rule that the
pressure of airy fluids is as the condensation. But it is to be
observed, that this process of calculation goes on the supposition
that the steam is cut off from contact with water, so that no more
steam can be generated; a case quite different from the common one, in
which the steam is more abundant as the heat is greater. The
examination of the force of vapor, when it is in contact with water,
must be briefly noticed.</p>
<p>During the period of which we have been speaking, the progress of
the investigation of the laws of aqueous vapor was much accelerated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page173">173</a></span> by the growing
importance of the steam-engine, in which those laws operated in a
practical form. James Watts, the main improver of that machine, was
thus a great contributor to speculative knowledge, as well as to
practical power. Many of his improvements depended on the laws which
regulate the quantity of heat which goes to the formation or
condensation of steam; and the observations which led to these
improvements enter into the induction of latent heat. Measurements of
the force of steam, at all temperatures, were made with the same view.
Watts’s attention had been drawn to the steam-engine in 1759, by
Robison, the former being then an instrument-maker, and the latter a
student at the University of Glasgow.<a id="fnanchor54-10"
href="#note54-10"><span class="fnanchor">54</span></a> In 1761 or
1762, he tried some experiments on the force of steam in a Papin’s
Digester;<a id="fnanchor55-10" href="#note55-10"><span
class="fnanchor">55</span></a> and formed a sort of working model of a
steam-engine, feeling already his vocation to develope the powers of
that invention. His knowledge was at that time principally derived
from Desaguliers and Belidor, but his own experiments added to it
rapidly. In 1764 and 1765, he made a more systematical course of
experiments, directed to ascertain the force of steam. He tried this
force, however, only at temperatures above the boiling-point; and
inferred it at lower degrees from the supposed continuity of the law
thus obtained. His friend Robison, also, was soon after led, by
reading the account of some experiments of Lord Charles Cavendish, and
some others of Mr. Nairne, to examine the same subject. He made out a
table of the correspondence of the elasticity and the temperature of
vapor, from thirty-two to two hundred and eighty degrees of
Fahrenheit’s thermometer.<a id="fnanchor56-10" href="#note56-10"><span
class="fnanchor">56</span></a> The thing here to be remarked, is the
establishment of a law of the pressure of steam, down to the
freezing-point of water. Ziegler of Basle, in 1769, and Achard of
Berlin, in 1782, made similar experiments. The latter examined also
the elasticity of the vapor of alcohol. Betancourt, in 1792, published
his Memoir on the expansive force of vapors; and his tables were for
some time considered the most exact. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page174">174</a></span> Prony, in his <i>Architecture
Hydraulique</i> (1796), established a mathematical formula,<a
id="fnanchor57-10" href="#note57-10"><span
class="fnanchor">57</span></a> on the experiments of Betancourt, who
began his researches in the belief that he was first in the field,
although he afterwards found that he had been anticipated by Ziegler.
Gren compared the experiments of Betancourt and De Luc with his own.
He ascertained an important fact, that when water <em>boils</em>, the
elasticity of the steam is equal to that of the atmosphere. Schmidt at
Giessen endeavored to improve the apparatus used by Betancourt; and
Biker, of Rotterdam, in 1800, made new trials for the same
purpose.</p>

<p>In 1801, Mr. Dalton communicated to the Philosophical Society of
Manchester his investigations on this subject; observing truly, that
though the forces at high temperatures are most important when steam
is considered as a mechanical agent, the progress of philosophy is
more immediately interested in accurate observations on the force at
low temperatures. He also found that his elasticities for equidistant
temperatures resembled a <em>geometrical progression</em>, but with a
ratio constantly diminishing. Dr. Ure, in 1818, published in the
<i>Philosophical Transactions</i> of London, experiments of the same
kind, valuable from the high temperatures at which they were made, and
for the simplicity of his apparatus. The law which he thus obtained
approached, like Dalton’s, to a <i>geometrical progression</i>. Dr.
Ure says, that a formula proposed by M. Biot gives an error of near
nine inches out of seventy-five, at a temperature of 266 degrees. This
is very conceivable, for if the formula be wrong at all, the
geometrical progress rapidly inflames the error in the higher portions
of the scale. The elasticity of steam, at high temperatures, has also
been experimentally examined by Mr. Southern, of Soho, and Mr. Sharpe,
of Manchester. Mr. Dalton has attempted to deduce certain general laws
from Mr. Sharpe’s experiments; and other persons have offered other
rules, as those which govern the force of steam with reference to the
temperature: but no rule appears yet to have assumed the character of
an established scientific truth. Yet the law of the expansive force of
steam is not only required in order that the steam-engine may be
employed with safety and to the best advantage; but must also be an
important point in every consistent thermotical theory.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [To the experiments on steam made by private physicists,
are to be added the experiments made on a grand scale by order of the
governments of France and of America, with a view to <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page175">175</a></span> legislation on the
subject of steam-engines. The French experiments were made in 1823,
under the direction of a commission consisting of some of the most
distinguished members of the Academy of Sciences; namely, MM. de
Prony, Arago, Girard, and Dulong. The American experiments were placed
in the hands of a committee of the Franklin Institute of the State of
Pennsylvania, consisting of Prof. Bache and others, in 1830. The
French experiments went as high as 435° of Fahrenheit’s thermometer,
corresponding to a pressure of 60 feet of mercury, or 24 atmospheres.
The American experiments were made up to a temperature of 346°, which
corresponded to 274 inches of mercury, more than 9 atmospheres. The
extensive range of these experiments affords great advantages for
determining the law of the expansive force. The French Academy found
that their experiments indicated an increase of the elastic force
according to the <em>fifth</em> power of a binominal <span
style="white-space: nowrap;">1 + <i>mt</i>,</span> where <i>t</i> is
the temperature. The American Institute were led to a <em>sixth</em>
power of a like binominal. Other experimenters have expressed their
results, not by powers of the temperature, but by geometrical ratios.
Dr. Dalton had supposed that the expansion of mercury being as the
square of the true temperature above its freezing-point, the expansive
force of steam increases in geometrical ratio for equal increments of
temperature. And the author of the article <i>Steam</i> in the Seventh
Edition of the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> (Mr. J. S. Russell), has
found that the experiments are best satisfied by supposing mercury, as
well as steam, to expand in a geometrical ratio for equal increments
of the true temperature.</p>
<p>It appears by such calculation, that while dry gas increases in the
ratio of 8 to 11, by an increase of temperature from freezing to
boiling water; steam in contact with water, by the same increase of
temperature above boiling water, has its expansive force increased in
the proportion of 1 to 12. By an equal increase of temperature,
mercury expands in about the ratio of 8 to 9.</p>
<p>Recently, MM. Magnus of Berlin, Holzmann and Regnault, have made
series of observations on the relation between temperature and
elasticity of steam.<a id="fnanchor58-10" href="#note58-10"><span
class="fnanchor">58</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note58-10"
href="#fnanchor58-10">58</a></span> See Taylor’s <i>Scientific
Memoirs</i>, Aug. 1845, vol. iv. part xiv., and <i>Ann. de Chimie</i>.</div>
<p>Prof. Magnus measured his temperatures by an air-thermometer; a
process which, I <a href="#v2page150">stated</a> in the first edition, seemed to afford the
best promise of simplifying the law of expansion. His result is, that
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page176">176</a></span> elasticity
proceeds in a geometric series when the temperature proceeds in an
arithmetical series nearly; the differences of temperature for equal
augmentations of the ratio of elasticity being somewhat greater for
the higher temperatures.</p>
<p>The forces of the vapors of other liquids in contact with their
liquids, determined by Dr. Faraday, as mentioned in Chap. ii. <a

steam here spoken of.]</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 5.&#8212;<i>Consequences of the Doctrine of
Evaporation.&#8212;Explanation of Rain, Dew, and Clouds.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> discoveries concerning
the relations of heat and moisture which were made during the last
century, were principally suggested by meteorological inquiries, and
were applied to meteorology as fast as they rose. Still there remains,
on many points of this subject, so much doubt and obscurity, that we
cannot suppose the doctrines to have assumed their final form; and
therefore we are not here called upon to trace their progress and
connexion. The principles of atmology are pretty well understood; but
the difficulty of observing the conditions under which they produce
their effects in the atmosphere is so great, that the precise theory
of most meteorological phenomena is still to be determined.</p>
<p>We have already considered the answers given to the question:
According to what rules does transparent aqueous vapor resume its form
of visible water? This question includes, not only the problems of
Rain and Dew, but also of Clouds; for clouds are not vapor, but water,
vapor being always invisible. An opinion which attracted much notice
in its time, was that of Hutton, who, in 1784, endeavored to prove
that if two masses of air saturated with transparent vapor at
different temperatures are mixed together, the precipitation of water
in the form either of cloud or of drops will take place. The reason he
assigned for the opinion was this: that the temperature of the mixture
is a mean between the two temperatures, but that the force of the
vapor in the mixture, which is the mean of the forces of the two
component vapors, will be greater than that which corresponds to the
mean temperature, since the force increases faster than the
temperature;<a id="fnanchor59-10" href="#note59-10"><span
class="fnanchor">59</span></a> and hence some part of the vapor will
be precipitated. This doctrine, it will be seen, speaks of vapor as
“saturating” air, and is <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page177">177</a></span> therefore, in this form, inconsistent
with Dalton’s principle; but it is not difficult to modify the
expression so as to retain the essential part of the explanation.</p>

<p><i>Dew.</i>&#8212;The principle of a “constituent temperature” of
steam, and the explanation of the “dew-point,” were known, as we have
said (chap. iii. <a href="#v2page170">sect. 3</a>,) to the
meteorologists of the last century; but we perceive how incomplete
their knowledge was, by the very gradual manner in which the
consequences of this principle were traced out. We have already
noticed, as one of the books which most drew attention to the true
doctrine, in this country at least, Dr. Wells’s <i>Essay on Dew</i>,
published in 1814. In this work the author gives an account of the
progress of his opinions;<a id="fnanchor60-10" href="#note60-10"><span
class="fnanchor">60</span></a> “I was led,” he says, “in the autumn of
1784, by the event of a rude experiment, to think it probable that the
formation of dew is attended with the production of cold.” This was
confirmed by the experiments of others. But some years after, “upon
considering the subject more closely, I began to suspect that Mr.
Wilson, Mr. Six, and myself, had all committed an error in regarding
the cold which accompanies the dew, as an <em>effect</em> of the
formation of the dew.” He now considered it rather as the
<em>cause</em>: and soon found that he was able to account for the
circumstances of this formation, many of them curious and paradoxical,
by supposing the bodies on which dew is deposited, to be cooled down,
by radiation into the clear night-sky, to the proper temperature. The
same principle will obviously explain the formation of mists over
streams and lakes when the air is cooler than the water; which was put
forward by Davy, even in 1810, as a new doctrine, or at least not
familiar.</p>

<p><i>Hygrometers.</i>&#8212;According as air has more or less of
vapor in comparison with that which its temperature and pressure
enable it to contain, it is more or less humid; and an instrument
which measures the degrees of such a gradation is a <i>hygrometer</i>.
The hygrometers which were at first invented, were those which
measured the moisture by its effect in producing expansion or
contraction in certain organic substances; thus De Saussure devised a
hair-hygrometer, De Luc a whalebone-hygrometer, and Dalton used a
piece of whipcord. All these contrivances were variable in the amount
of their indications under the same circumstances; and, moreover, it
was not easy to know the physical meaning of the degree indicated. The
dew-point, or constituent temperature of the vapor which exists in the
air, is, on <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page178">178</a></span> the
other hand, both constant and definite. The determination of this
point, as a datum for the moisture of the atmosphere, was employed by
Le Roi, and by Dalton (1802), the condensation being obtained by cold
water:<a id="fnanchor61-10" href="#note61-10"><span
class="fnanchor">61</span></a> and finally, Mr. Daniell (1812)
constructed an instrument, where the condensing temperature was
produced by evaporation of ether, in a very convenient manner. This
invention (<i>Daniell’s Hygrometer</i>) enables us to determine the
quantity of vapor which exists in a given mass of the atmosphere at
any time of observation.</p>

have been discovered, I may mention the completion of the theory and
use of the <i>Wet-bulb Hygrometer</i>; an instrument in which, from
the depression of temperature produced by wetting the bulb of a
thermometer, we infer the further depression which would produce dew.
Of this instrument the history is thus summed up by Prof.
Forbes:&#8212;“Hutton invented the method; Leslie revived and extended
it, giving probably the earliest, though an imperfect theory;
Gay-Lussac, by his excellent experiments and reasoning from them,
completed the theory, so far as perfectly dry air is concerned; Ivory
extended the theory; which was reduced to practice by Auguste and
Bohnenberger, who determined the constant with accuracy. English
observers have done little more than confirm the conclusions of our
industrious Germanic neighbors; nevertheless the experiments of Apjohn
and Prinsep must ever be considered as conclusively settling the value
of the coefficient near the one extremity of the scale, as those of
Kæmtz have done for the other.”<a id="fnanchor62-10"

why I have not given Meteorology a place among the Inductive Sciences;
but if the reader refers to these accounts, or any other adequate view
of the subject, he will see that Meteorology is not a single Inductive
Science, but the application of several sciences to the explanation of

class="fnanchor">63</span></a> Such particles, even if solid, would
descend very slowly; and very slight causes would suffice for their
suspension, without recurring to the hypothesis of vesicles, of which
we have <a href="#v2page165">already</a> spoken. Indeed that
hypothesis will not explain the fact, except we suppose these vesicles
filled with a rarer air than that of the atmosphere; and, accordingly,
though this hypothesis is still maintained by some,<a
id="fnanchor64-10" href="#note64-10"><span
class="fnanchor">64</span></a> it is asserted as a fact of
observation, proved by optical or other phenomena, and not deduced
from the suspension of clouds. Yet the latter result is still
variously explained by different philosophers: thus, M. Gay-Lussac<a
id="fnanchor65-10" href="#note65-10"><span
class="fnanchor">65</span></a> accounts for it by upward currents of
air, and Fresnel explains it by the heat and rarefaction of air in the
interior of the cloud.</p>

<p><i>Classification of Clouds.</i>&#8212;A classification of clouds
can then only be consistent and intelligible when it rests upon their
atmological conditions. Such a system was proposed by Mr. Luke Howard,
in 1802&#8211;3. His primary modifications are, <i>Cirrus</i>,
<i>Cumulus</i>, and <i>Stratus</i>, which the Germans have translated
by terms equivalent in English to <i>feather-cloud</i>,
<i>heap-cloud</i>, and <i>layer-cloud</i>. The cumulus increases by
accumulations on its top, and floats in the air with a horizontal
base; the stratus grows from below, and spreads along the earth; the
cirrus consists of fibres in the higher regions of the atmosphere,
which grow every way. Between the simple modifications are
intermediate ones, <i>cirro-cumulus</i> and <i>cirro-stratus</i>; and,
again, compound ones, the <i>cumulo-stratus</i> and the <i>nimbus</i>,
or <i>rain-cloud</i>. These distinctions have been generally accepted
all over Europe: and have rendered a description of all the processes
which go on in the atmosphere far more definite and clear than it
could be made before their use.</p>
<p>I omit a mass of facts and opinions, supposed laws of phenomena and
assigned causes, which abound in meteorology more than in any other
science. The slightest consideration will show us what a great <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page180">180</a></span> amount of labor, of
persevering and combined observation, the progress of this branch of
knowledge requires. I do not even speak of the condition of the more
elevated parts of the atmosphere. The diminution of temperature as we
ascend, one of the most marked of atmospheric facts, has been
variously explained by different writers. Thus Dalton<a
id="fnanchor66-10" href="#note66-10"><span
class="fnanchor">66</span></a> (1808) refers it to a principle “that
each atom of air, in the same perpendicular column, is possessed of
the same degree of heat,” which principle he conceives to be entirely
empirical in this case. Fourier says<a id="fnanchor67-10"
href="#note67-10"><span class="fnanchor">67</span></a> (1817), “This
phenomenon results from several causes: one of the principal is the
progressive extinction of the rays of heat in the successive strata of
the atmosphere.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Physical Theories of Heat.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">WHEN</span> we look at the condition
of that branch of knowledge which, according to the phraseology
already employed, we must call <i>Physical Thermotics</i>, in
opposition to Formal Thermotics, which gives us detached laws of
phenomena, we find the prospect very different from that which was
presented to us by physical astronomy, optics, and acoustics. In these
sciences, the maintainers of a distinct and comprehensive theory have
professed at least to show that it explains and includes the principal
laws of phenomena of various kinds; in Thermotics, we have only
attempts to explain a part of the facts. We have here no example of an
hypothesis which, assumed in order to explain one class of phenomena,
has been found also to account exactly for another; as when central
forces led to the precession of the equinoxes, or when the explanation
of polarization explained also double refraction; or when the pressure
of the atmosphere, as measured by the barometer, gave the true
velocity of sound. Such coincidences, or <i>consiliences</i>, as I
have elsewhere called them, are the test of truth; and thermotical
theories cannot yet exhibit credentials of this kind. <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page181">181</a></span></p>
<p>On looking back at our view of this science, it will be seen that
it may be distinguished into two parts; the Doctrines of Conduction
and Radiation, which we call Thermotics proper; and the Doctrines
respecting the relation of Heat, Airs, and Moisture, which we have
termed Atmology. These two subjects differ in their bearing on our
hypothetical views.</p>
<p><i>Thermotical Theories.</i>&#8212;The phenomena of radiant heat,
like those of radiant light, obviously admit of general explanation in
two different ways;&#8212;by the emission of material particles, or by
the propagation of undulations. Both these opinions have found
supporters. Probably most persons, in adopting Prevost’s theory of
exchanges, conceive the radiation of heat to be the radiation of
matter. The undulation hypothesis, on the other hand, appears to be
suggested by the production of heat by friction, and was accordingly
maintained by Rumford and others. Leslie<a id="fnanchor68-10"
href="#note68-10"><span class="fnanchor">68</span></a> appears, in a
great part of his <i>Inquiry</i>, to be a supporter of some undulatory
doctrine, but it is extremely difficult to make out what his
undulating medium is; or rather, his opinions wavered during his
progress. In page 31, he asks, “What is this calorific and frigorific
fluid? and after keeping the reader in suspense for a moment, he
replies,</p>
<p class="center medium eq">“Quod petis hic est.</p>
<p class="noind eq">It is merely the ambient AIR.” But at page 150, he
again asks the question, and, at page 188, he answers, “It is the same
subtile matter that, according to its different modes of existence,
constitutes either heat or light.” A person thus vacillating between
two opinions, one of which is palpably false, and the other laden with
exceeding difficulties which he does not even attempt to remove, had
little right to protest against<a id="fnanchor69-10"
href="#note69-10"><span class="fnanchor">69</span></a> “the sportive
freaks of some intangible <i>aura</i>;” to rank all other hypotheses
than his own with the “occult qualities of the schools;” and to class
the “prejudices” of his opponents with the tenets of those who
maintained the <i>fuga vacui</i> in opposition to Torricelli. It is
worth while noticing this kind of rhetoric, in order to observe, that
it may be used just as easily on the wrong side as on the right.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note68-10"
href="#fnanchor68-10">68</a></span> <i>An Experimental Inquiry into
the Nature and Propagation of Heat</i>, 1804.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note69-10"
href="#fnanchor69-10">69</a></span> Ib. p. 47.</div>
<p>Till recently, the theory of material heat, and of its propagation
by emission, was probably the one most in favor with those who had
studied mathematical thermotics. As we have <a
href="#v2page141">said</a>, the laws of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page182">182</a></span> conduction, in their ultimate analytical
form, were almost identical with the laws of motion of fluids.
Fourier’s principle also, that the radiation of heat takes place from
points below the surface, and is intercepted by the superficial
particles, appears to favor the notion of material emission.</p>
<p>Accordingly, some of the most eminent modern French mathematicians
have accepted and extended the hypothesis of a material caloric. In
addition to Fourier’s doctrine of molecular extra-radiation, Laplace
and Poisson have maintained the hypothesis of <i>molecular
intra-radiation</i>, as the mode in which conduction takes place; that
is, they say that the particles of bodies are to be considered as
<i>discrete</i>, or as points separated from each other, and acting on
each other at a distance; and the conduction of heat from one part to
another, is performed by radiation between all neighboring particles.
They hold that, without this hypothesis, the differential equations
expressing the conditions of conduction cannot be made homogeneous:
but this assertion rests, I conceive, on an error, as Fourier has
shown, by dispensing with the hypothesis. The necessity of the
hypothesis of discrete molecular action in bodies, is maintained in
all cases by M. Poisson; and he has asserted Laplace’s theory of
capillary attraction to be defective on this ground, as Laplace
asserted Fourier’s reasoning respecting heat to be so. In reality,
however, this hypothesis of discrete molecules cannot be maintained as
a physical truth; for the law of molecular action, which is assumed in
the reasoning, after answering its purpose in the progress of
calculation, vanishes in the result; the conclusion is the same,
whatever law of the intervals of the molecules be assumed. The
definite integral, which expresses the whole action, no more proves
that this action is actually made of the differential parts by means
of which it was found, than the processes of finding the weight of a
body by integration, prove it to be made up of differential weights.
And therefore, even if we were to adopt the emission theory of heat,
we are by no means bound to take along with it the hypothesis of
discrete molecules.</p>
<p>But the recent discovery of the refraction, polarization, and
depolarization of heat, has quite altered the theoretical aspect of
the subject, and, almost at a single blow, ruined the emission theory.
Since heat is reflected and refracted like light, analogy would lead
us to conclude that the mechanism of the processes is the same in the
two cases. And when we add to these properties the property of
polarization, it is scarcely possible to believe otherwise than that
heat consists in <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page183">183</a></span> transverse vibrations; for no wise
philosopher would attempt an explanation by ascribing poles to the
emitted particles, after the experience which Optics affords, of the
utter failure of such machinery.</p>
<p>But here the question occurs, If heat consists in vibrations,
whence arises the extraordinary identity of the laws of its
propagation with the laws of the flow of matter? How is it that, in
conducted heat, this vibration creeps slowly from one part of the body
to another, the part first heated remaining hottest; instead of
leaving its first place and travelling rapidly to another, as the
vibrations of sound and light do? The answer to these questions has
been put in a very distinct and plausible form by that distinguished
philosopher, M. Ampère, who published a <i>Note on Heat and Light
considered as the results of Vibratory Motion</i>,<a
id="fnanchor70-10" href="#note70-10"><span
class="fnanchor">70</span></a> in 1834 and 1835; and though this
answer is an hypothesis, it at least shows that there is no fatal
force in the difficulty.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note70-10"
href="#fnanchor70-10">70</a></span> <i>Bibliothèque Universelle de
Genève</i>, vol. xlix. p. 225. <i>Ann. Chim.</i> tom. lvii. p.
434.</div>
<p>M. Ampère’s hypothesis is this; that bodies consist of solid
molecules, which may be considered as arranged at intervals in a very
rare ether; and that the vibrations of the molecules, causing
vibrations of the ether and caused by them, constitute heat. On these
suppositions, we should have the phenomena of conduction explained;
for if the molecules at one end of a bar be hot, and therefore in a
state of vibration, while the others are at rest, the vibrating
molecules propagate vibrations in the ether, but these vibrations do
not produce heat, except in proportion as they put the quiescent
molecules of the bar in vibration; and the ether being very rare
compared with the molecules, it is only by the repeated impulses of
many successive vibrations that the nearest quiescent molecules are
made to vibrate; after which they combine in communicating the
vibration to the more remote molecules. “We then find necessarily,” M.
Ampère adds, “the same equations as those found by Fourier for the
distribution of heat, setting out from the same hypothesis, that the
temperature or heat transmitted is proportional to the difference of
the temperatures.”</p>
<p>Since the undulatory hypothesis of heat can thus answer all obvious
objections, we may consider it as upon its trial, to be confirmed or
modified by future discoveries; and especially by an enlarged
knowledge of the laws of the polarization of heat.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [Since the first edition was written, the analogies
between light and heat have been further extended, as I have already
stated. It <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page184">184</a></span> has
been discovered by MM. Biot and Melloni that quartz impresses a
circular polarization upon heat; and by Prof. Forbes that mica, of a
certain thickness, produces phenomena such as would be produced by the
impression of circular polarization of the supposed transversal
vibrations of radiant heat; and further, a rhomb of rock-salt, of the
shape of the glass rhomb which verified Fresnel’s extraordinary
anticipation of the circular polarization of light, verified the
expectation, founded upon other analogies, of the polarization of
heat. By passing polarized heat through various thicknesses of mica,
Prof. Forbes has attempted to calculate the length of an undulation
for heat.</p>
<p>These analogies cannot fail to produce a strong disposition to
believe that light and heat, essences so closely connected that they
can hardly be separated, and thus shown to have so many curious
properties in common, are propagated by the same machinery; and thus
we are led to an Undulatory Theory of Heat.</p>
<p>Yet such a Theory has not yet by any means received full
confirmation. It depends upon the analogy and the connexion of the
Theory of Light, and would have little weight if those were removed.
For the separation of the rays in double refraction, and the phenomena
of periodical intensity, the two classes of facts out of which the
Undulatory Theory of Optics principally grew, have neither of them
been detected in thermotical experiments. Prof. Forbes has assumed
alternations of heat for increasing thicknesses of mica, but in his
experiments we find only one <em>maximum</em>. The occurrence of
alternate maxima and minima under the like circumstances would exhibit
visible waves of heat, as the fringes of shadows do of light, and
would thus add much to the evidence of the theory.</p>
<p>Even if I conceived the Undulatory Theory of Heat to be now
established, I should not venture, as yet, to describe its
establishment as an event in the history of the Inductive Sciences. It
is only at an interval of time after such events have taken place that
their history and character can be fully understood, so as to suggest
lessons in the Philosophy of Science.]</p>
<p><i>Atmological Theories.</i>&#8212;Hypotheses of the relations of
heat and air almost necessarily involve a reference to the forces by
which the composition of bodies is produced, and thus cannot properly
be treated of, till we have surveyed the condition of chemical
knowledge. But we may say a few words on one such hypothesis; I mean
the hypothesis on the subject of the atmological laws of heat,
proposed by Laplace, in the twelfth Book of the <i>Mécanique
Céléste</i>, and published in 1823. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page185">185</a></span> It will be recollected that the main
laws of phenomena for which we have to account, by means of such an
hypothesis, are the following:&#8212;</p>
<p>(1.) The law of Boyle and Mariotte, that the elasticity of an air
varies as its density. See Chap. iii., <a href="#v2page163">Sect.
1</a> of this Book.</p>
<p>(2.) The Law of Gay-Lussac and Dalton, that all airs expand equally
by heat. See Chap. ii. <a href="#v2page157">Sect. 1</a>.</p>
<p>(3.) The production of heat by sudden compression. See Chap. ii. <a
href="#v2page159">Sect. 2</a>.</p>
<p>(4.) Dalton’s principle of the mechanical mixture of airs. See
Chap. iii. <a href="#v2page170">Sect. 3</a>.</p>
<p>(5.) The Law of expansion of solids and fluids by heat. See Chap.
ii. <a href="#v2page157">Sect. 1</a>.</p>
<p>(6.) Changes of consistence by heat, and the doctrine of latent
heat. See Chap. ii. <a href="#v2page160">Sect. 3</a>.</p>
<p>(7.) The Law of the expansive force of steam. See Chap. iii. <a
href="#v2page172">Sect. 4</a>.</p>
<p>Besides these, there are laws of which it is doubtful whether they
are or are not included in the preceding, as the low temperature of
the air in the higher parts of the atmosphere. (See Chap. iii. <a
href="#v2page180">Sect. 5</a>.)</p>
<p>Laplace’s hypothesis<a id="fnanchor71-10" href="#note71-10"><span
class="fnanchor">71</span></a> is this:&#8212;that bodies consist of
particles, each of which gathers round it, by its attraction, a
quantity of caloric: that the particles of the bodies attract each
other, besides attracting the caloric, and that the particles of the
caloric repel each other.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note71-10"
href="#fnanchor71-10">71</a></span> <i>Méc. Cél.</i> t. v. p.
89.</div>
<p>In gases, the particles of the bodies are so far removed, that
their mutual attraction is insensible, and the matter tends to expand
by the mutual repulsion of the caloric. He conceives this caloric to
be constantly radiating among the particles; the density of this
internal radiation is the <i>temperature</i>, and he proves that, on
this supposition, the elasticity of the air will be as the density,
and as this temperature. Hence follow the three first rules above
stated. The same suppositions lead to Dalton’s principle of mixtures
(4), though without involving his mode of conception; for Laplace says
that whatever the mutual action of two gases be, the whole pressure
will be equal to the sum of the separate pressures.<a
id="fnanchor72-10" href="#note72-10"><span
class="fnanchor">72</span></a> Expansion (5), and the changes of
consistence (6), are explained by supposing<a id="fnanchor73-10"
href="#note73-10"><span class="fnanchor">73</span></a> that in solids,
the mutual attraction of the particles of the body is the greatest
force; in liquids, the attraction of the particles for the caloric; in
airs, the repulsion of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page186">186</a></span> the caloric. But the doctrine of latent
heat again modifies<a id="fnanchor74-10" href="#note74-10"><span
class="fnanchor">74</span></a> the hypothesis, and makes it necessary
to include latent heat in the calculation; yet there is not, as we
might suppose there would be if the theory were the true one, any
confirmation of the hypothesis resulting from the new class of laws
thus referred to. Nor does it appear that the hypothesis accounts for
the relation between the elasticity and the temperature of steam.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note72-10"

href="#fnanchor74-10">74</a></span> <i>Méc. Cél.</i> t. v. p.
93.</div>
<p>It will be observed that Laplace’s hypothesis goes entirely upon
the materiality of heat, and is inconsistent with any vibratory
theory; for, as Ampère remarks, “It is clear that if we admit heat to
consist in vibrations, it is a contradiction to attribute to heat (or
caloric) a repulsive force of the particles which would be a cause of
vibration.”</p>
<p>An unfavorable judgment of Laplace’s Theory of Gases is suggested
by looking for that which, in speaking of Optics, was mentioned as the
great characteristic of a true theory; namely, that the hypotheses,
which were assumed in order to account for one class of facts, are
found to explain another class of a different nature:&#8212;the
consilience of inductions. Thus, in thermotics, the law of an
intensity of radiation proportional to the sine of the angle of the
ray with the surface, which is founded on direct experiments of
radiation, is found to be necessary in order to explain the tendency
of neighboring bodies to equality of temperature; and this leads to
the higher generalization, that heat is radiant from points below the
surface. But in the doctrine of the relation of heat to gases, as
delivered by Laplace, there is none of this unexpected confirmation;
and though he explains some of the leading laws, his assumptions bear
a large proportion to the laws explained. Thus, from the assumption
that the repulsion of gases arises from the mutual repulsion of the
particles of caloric, he finds that the pressure in any gas is as the
square of the density and of the quantity of caloric;<a
id="fnanchor75-10" href="#note75-10"><span
class="fnanchor">75</span></a> and from the assumption that the
temperature is the internal radiation, he finds that this temperature
is as the density and the square of the caloric.<a id="fnanchor76-10"
href="#note76-10"><span class="fnanchor">76</span></a> Hence he
obtains the law of Boyle and Mariotte, and that of Dalton and
Gay-Lussac. But this view of the subject requires other assumptions
when we come to latent heat; and accordingly, he introduces, to
express the latent heat, a new quantity.<a id="fnanchor77-10"
href="#note77-10"><span class="fnanchor">77</span></a> Yet this
quantity produces no effect on his calculations, nor does he apply his
reasoning to any problem in which latent heat is concerned.</p>

then, deciding upon this theory, we may venture to say that it is
wanting in all the prominent and striking characteristics which we
have found in those great theories which we look upon as clearly and
indisputably established.</p>
<p><i>Conclusion.</i>&#8212;We may observe, moreover, that heat has
other bearings and effects, which, as soon as they have been analysed
into numerical laws of phenomena, must be attended to in the formation
of thermotical theories. Chemistry will probably supply many such;
those which occur to us, we must examine hereafter. But we may mention
as examples of such, MM. De la Rive and Marcet’s law, that the
specific heat of all gases is the same;<a id="fnanchor78-10"
href="#note78-10"><span class="fnanchor">78</span></a> and MM. Dulong
and Petit’s law, that single atoms of all simple bodies have the same
capacity for heat.<a id="fnanchor79-10" href="#note79-10"><span
class="fnanchor">79</span></a> Though we have not yet said anything of
the relation of different gases, or explained the meaning of
<i>atoms</i> in the chemical sense, it will easily be conceived that
these are very general and important propositions.</p>

<p>Thus the science of Thermotics, imperfect as it is, forms a
highly-instructive part of our survey; and is one of the cardinal
points on which the doors of those chambers of physical knowledge must
turn which hitherto have remained closed. For, on the one hand, this
science is related by strong analogies and dependencies to the most
complete portions of our knowledge, our mechanical doctrines and
optical theories; and on the other, it is connected with properties
and laws of a nature altogether different,&#8212;those of chemistry;
properties and laws depending upon a new system of notions and
relations, among which clear and substantial general principles are
far more difficult to lay hold of and with which the future progress
of human knowledge appears to be far more concerned. To these notions
and relations we must now proceed; but we shall find an intermediate
stage, in certain subjects which I shall call the
<i>Mechanico-chemical</i> Sciences; viz., those which have to do with
Magnetism, Electricity, and Galvanism.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<h4 class="five"><i>Of the Mechanico-Chemical Sciences.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">UNDER</span> the title of
Mechanico-Chemical Sciences, I include the laws of Magnetism,
Electricity, Galvanism, and the other classes of phenomena closely
related to these, as Thermo-electricity. This group of subjects forms
a curious and interesting portion of our physical knowledge; and not
the least of the circumstances which give them their interest, is that
double bearing upon mechanical and chemical principles, which their
name is intended to imply. Indeed, at first sight they appear to be
purely Mechanical Sciences; the attractions and repulsions, the
pressure and motion, which occur in these cases, are referrible to
mechanical conceptions and laws, as completely as the weight or fall
of terrestrial bodies, or the motion of the moon and planets. And if
the phenomena of magnetism and electricity had directed us only to
such laws, the corresponding sciences must have been arranged as
branches of mechanics. But we find that, on the other side, these
phenomena have laws and bearings of a kind altogether different.
Magnetism is associated with Electricity by its mechanical analogies;
and, more recently, has been discovered to be still more closely
connected with it by physical influence; electric is identified with
galvanic agency; but in galvanism, decomposition, or some action of
that kind, universally appears; and these appearances lead to very
general laws. Now composition and decomposition are the subjects of
Chemistry; and thus we find that we are insensibly but irresistibly
led into the domain of that science. The highest generalizations to
which we can look, in advancing from the elementary facts of
electricity and galvanism, must involve chemical notions; we must
therefore, in laying out the platform of these sciences, make
provision for that convergence of mechanical and chemical theory,
which they are to exhibit as we ascend.</p>
<p>We must begin, however, with stating the mechanical phenomena of
these sciences, and the reduction of such phenomena to laws. In this
point of view, the phenomena of which we have to speak are those in
which bodies exhibit attractions and repulsions, peculiarly determined
by their nature and circumstances; as the magnet, and a <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page192">192</a></span> piece of amber when
rubbed. Such results are altogether different from the universal
attraction which, according to Newton’s discovery, prevails among all
particles of matter, and to which cosmical phenomena are owing. But
yet the difference of these special attractions, and of cosmical
attraction, was at first so far from being recognized, that the only
way in which men could be led to conceive or assent to an action of
one body upon another at a distance, in cosmical cases, was by
likening it to magnetic attraction, as we have <a
href="#kepler">seen</a> in the history of Physical Astronomy. And we
shall, in the first part of our account, not dwell much upon the
peculiar conditions under which bodies are magnetic or electric, since
these conditions are not readily reducible to mechanical laws; but,
taking the magnetic or electric character for granted, we shall trace
its effects.</p>
<p>The habit of considering magnetic action as the type or general
case of attractive and repulsive agency, explains the early writers
having spoken of Electricity as a kind of Magnetism. Thus Gilbert, in
his book <i>De Magnete</i> (1600), has a chapter,<a id="fnanchor1-11"
href="#note1-11"><span class="fnanchor">1</span></a> <i>De coitione
Magniticâ, primumque de Succini attractione, sive verius corporum ad
Succinum applicatione</i>. The manner in which he speaks, shows us how
mysterious the fact of attraction then appeared; so that, as he says,
“the magnet and amber were called in aid by philosophers as
illustrations, when our sense is in the dark in abstruse inquiries,
and when our reason can go no further. Gilbert speaks of these
phenomena like a genuine inductive philosopher, reproving<a
id="fnanchor2-11" href="#note2-11"><span class="fnanchor">2</span></a>
those who before him had “stuffed the booksellers’ shops by copying
from one another extravagant stories concerning the attraction of
magnets and amber, without giving any reason from experiment.” He
himself makes some important steps in the subject. He distinguishes
magnetic from <i>electric</i> forces,<a id="fnanchor3-11"
href="#note3-11"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a> and is the
inventor of the latter name, derived from ἤλεκτρον, <i>electron</i>,
amber. He observes rightly, that the electric force attracts all light
bodies, while the magnetic force attracts iron only; and he devises a
satisfactory apparatus by which this is shown. He gives<a
id="fnanchor4-11" href="#note4-11"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a>
a considerable list of bodies which possess the electric property;
“Not only amber and agate attract small bodies, as some think, but
diamond, sapphire, carbuncle, opal, amethyst, Bristol gem, beryli,
crystal, glass, glass of antimony, spar of various kinds, sulphur,
mastic, sealing-wax,” and other substances which he mentions. Even his
speculations on the general laws of these phenomena, though vague and
erroneous, as <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page193">193</a></span>
at that period was unavoidable, do him no discredit when compared with
the doctrines of his successors a century and a half afterwards. But
such speculations belong to a succeeding part of this history.</p>

<p>In treating of these Sciences, I will speak of Electricity in the
first place; although it is thus separated by the interposition of
Magnetism from the succeeding subjects (Galvanism, &amp;c.) with which
its alliance seems, at first sight, the closest, and although some
general notions of the laws of magnets were obtained at an earlier
period than a knowledge of the corresponding relations of electric
phenomena: for the theory of electric attraction and repulsion is
somewhat more simple than of magnetic; was, in fact, the first
obtained; and was of use in suggesting and confirming the
generalization of magnetic laws.</p>
<hr class="three space-above" />
<h3>CHAPTER 1.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Discovery of Laws of Electric Phenomena.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">WE</span> have already seen what was
the state of this branch of knowledge at the beginning of the
seventeenth century; and the advances made by Gilbert. We must now
notice the additions which it subsequently received, and especially
those which led to the discovery of general laws, and the
establishment of the theory; events of this kind being those of which
we have more peculiarly to trace the conditions and causes. Among the
facts which we have thus especially to attend to, are the electric
attractions of small bodies by amber and other substances when rubbed.
Boyle, who repeated and extended the experiments of Gilbert, does not
appear to have arrived at any new general notions; but Otto Guericke
of Magdeburg, about the same time, made a very material step, by
discovering that there was an electric force of repulsion as well as
of attraction. He found that when a globe of sulphur had attracted a
feather, it afterwards repelled it, till the feather had been in
contact with some other body. This, when verified under a due
generality of circumstances, forms a capital fact in our present
subject. Hawkesbee, who wrote in 1709 (<i>Physico-Mechanical
Experiments</i>) also observed various of the effects of attraction
and repulsion upon threads hanging loosely. But the person who appears
to have first fully seized the general law of these facts, is <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page194">194</a></span> Dufay, whose
experiments appear in the Memoirs of the French Academy, in 1733,
1734, and 1737.<a id="fnanchor5-11" href="#note5-11"><span
class="fnanchor">5</span></a> “I discovered,” he says, “a very simple
principle, which accounts for a great part of the irregularities, and,
if I may use the term, the caprices that seem to accompany most of the
experiments in electricity. This principle is, that electric bodies
attract all those that are not so, and repel them as soon as they are
become electric by the vicinity or contact of the electric body. . . .
Upon applying this principle to various experiments of electricity,
any one will be surprised at the number of obscure and puzzling facts
which it clears up.” By the help of this principle, he endeavors to
explain several of Hawkesbee’s experiments.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note5-11"
href="#fnanchor5-11">5</a></span> Priestley’s <i>History of
Electricity</i>, p. 45, and the Memoirs quoted.</div>
<p>A little anterior to Dufay’s experiments were those of Grey, who,
in 1729, discovered the properties of <i>conductors</i>. He found that
the attraction and repulsion which appear in electric bodies are
exhibited also by other bodies in contact with the electric. In this
manner he found that an ivory ball, connected with a glass tube by a
stick, a wire, or a packthread, attracted and repelled a feather, as
the glass itself would have done. He was then led to try to extend
this communication to considerable distances, first by ascending to an
upper window and hanging down his ball, and, afterwards, by carrying
the string horizontally supported on loops. As his success was
complete in the former case, he was perplexed by failure in the
latter; but when he supported the string by loops of silk instead of
hempen cords, he found it again become a conductor of electricity.
This he ascribed at first to the smaller thickness of the silk, which
did not carry off so much of the electric virtue; but from this
explanation he was again driven, by finding that wires of brass still
thinner than the silk destroyed the effect. Thus Grey perceived that
the efficacy of the support depended on its being silk, and he soon
found other substances which answered the same purpose. The
difference, in fact, depended on the supporting substance being
electric, and therefore not itself a conductor; for it soon appeared
from such experiments, and especially<a id="fnanchor6-11"
href="#note6-11"><span class="fnanchor">6</span></a> from those made
by Dufay, that substances might be divided into <i>electrics per
se</i>, and <i>non-electrics</i>, or <i>conductors</i>. These terms
were introduced by Desaguliers,<a id="fnanchor7-11"
href="#note7-11"><span class="fnanchor">7</span></a> and gave a
permanent currency to the results of the labors of Grey and
others.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note6-11"
href="#fnanchor6-11">6</a></span> <i>Mém. Acad. Par.</i> 1734.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note7-11"
href="#fnanchor7-11">7</a></span> Priestley, p. 66.</div>
<p>Another very important discovery belonging to this period is, that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page195">195</a></span> of the two
kinds of electricity. This also was made by Dufay. “Chance,” says he,
“has thrown in my way another principle more universal and remarkable
than the preceding one, and which casts a new light upon the subject
of electricity. The principle is, that there are two distinct kinds of
electricity, very different from one another; one of which I call
<i>vitreous</i>, the other <i>resinous</i>, electricity. The first is
that of glass, gems, hair, wool, &amp;c.; the second is that of amber,
gum-lac, silk, &amp;c. The characteristic of these two electricities
is, that they repel themselves and attract each other.” This discovery
does not, however, appear to have drawn so much attention as it
deserved. It was published in 1735; (in the Memoirs of the Academy
<i>for</i> 1733;) and yet in 1747, Franklin and his friends at
Philadelphia, who had been supplied with electrical apparatus and
information by persons in England well acquainted with the then
present state of the subject, imagined that they were making
observations unknown to European science, when they were led to assert
two conditions of bodies, which were in fact the opposite
electricities of Dufay, though the American experimenters referred
them to a single element, of which electrized bodies might have either
excess or defect. “Hence,” Franklin says, “have arisen some new terms
among us: we say B,” who receives a spark from glass, “and bodies in
like circumstances, is electrized <i>positively</i>; A,” who
communicates his electricity to glass, “<i>negatively</i>; or rather B
is electrized <i>plus</i>, A <i>minus</i>.” Dr. (afterwards Sir
William) Watson had, about the same time, arrived at the same
conclusions, which he expresses by saying that the electricity of A
was <i>more rare</i>, and that of B <i>more dense</i>, than it
naturally would have been.<a id="fnanchor8-11" href="#note8-11"><span
class="fnanchor">8</span></a> But that which gave the main importance
to this doctrine was its application to some remarkable experiments,
of which we must now speak.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note8-11"
href="#fnanchor8-11">8</a></span> Priestley, p. 115.</div>
<p>Electric action is accompanied, in many cases, by light and a
crackling sound. Otto Guericke<a id="fnanchor9-11"
href="#note9-11"><span class="fnanchor">9</span></a> observes that his
sulphur-globe, when rubbed in a dark place, gave faint flashes, such
as take place when sugar is crushed. And shortly after, a light was
observed at the surface of the mercury in the barometer, when shaken,
which was explained at first by Bernoulli, on the then prevalent
Cartesian principles; but, afterwards, more truly by Hawkesbee, as an
electrical phenomenon. Wall, in 1708, found sparks produced by rubbing
amber, and Hawkesbee observed the light and the <i>snapping</i>, as he
calls it, under various modifications. But the electric spark from a
living body, which, as <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page196">196</a></span> Priestley says,<a id="fnanchor10-11"
href="#note10-11"><span class="fnanchor">10</span></a> “makes a
principal part of the diversion of gentlemen and ladies who come to
see experiments in electricity,” was first observed by Dufay and the
Abbé Nollet. Nollet says<a id="fnanchor11-11" href="#note11-11"><span
class="fnanchor">11</span></a> he “shall never forget the surprise
which the first electric spark ever drawn from the human body excited,
both in M. Dufay and in himself.” The drawing of a spark from the
human body was practised in various forms, one of which was familiarly
known as the “electrical kiss.” Other exhibitions of electrical light
were the electrical star, electrical rain, and the like.</p>

<i>Leçons de Physique</i>, vol.  vi. p. 408.</div>
<p>As electricians determined more exactly the conditions of
electrical action, they succeeded in rendering more intense those
sudden actions which the spark accompanies, and thus produced the
electric <i>shock</i>. This was especially done in the <i>Leyden
phial</i>. This apparatus received its name, while the discovery of
its property was attributed to Cunæus, a native of Leyden, who, in
1746, handling a vessel containing water in communication with the
electrical machine, and happening thus to bring the inside and the
outside into connexion, received a sudden shock in his arms and
breast. It appears, however,<a id="fnanchor12-11"
href="#note12-11"><span class="fnanchor">12</span></a> that a shock
had been received under nearly the same circumstances in 1746, by Von
Kleist, a German prelate, at Camin, in Pomerania. The strangeness of
this occurrence, and the suddenness of the blow, much exaggerated the
estimate which men formed of its force. Muschenbroek, after taking one
shock, declared he would not take a second for the kingdom of France;
though Boze, with a more magnanimous spirit, wished<a
id="fnanchor13-11" href="#note13-11"><span
class="fnanchor">13</span></a> that he might die by such a stroke, and
have the circumstances of the experiment recorded in the Memoirs of
the Academy. But we may easily imagine what a new fame and interest
this discovery gave to the subject of electricity. It was repeated in
all parts of the world, with various modifications: and the shock was
passed through a line of several persons holding hands; Nollet, in the
presence of the king of France, sent it through a circle of 180 men of
the guards, and along a line of men and wires of 900 toises;<a
id="fnanchor14-11" href="#note14-11"><span
class="fnanchor">14</span></a> and experiments of the same kind were
made in England, principally under the direction of Watson, on a scale
so large as to excite the admiration of Muschenbroek; who says, in a
letter to Watson, “Magnificentissimis tuis experimentis superasti
conatus omnium.” The result was, that the transmission of electricity
through a length of 12,000 feet was, to sense, instantaneous.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note12-11"

href="#fnanchor14-11">14</a></span> Ibid. v. 512.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page197">197</a></span> The
essential circumstances of the electric shock were gradually
unravelled. Watson found that it did not increase in proportion either
to the contents of the phial or the size of the globe by which the
electricity was excited; that the outside coating of the glass (which,
in the first form of the experiment, was only a film of water), and
its contents, might be varied in different ways. To Franklin is due
the merit of clearly pointing out most of the circumstances on which
the efficacy of the Leyden phial depends. He showed, in 1747,<a
id="fnanchor15-11" href="#note15-11"><span
class="fnanchor">15</span></a> that the inside of the bottle is
electrized positively, the outside negatively; and that the shock is
produced by the restoration of the equilibrium, when the outside and
inside are brought into communication suddenly. But in order to
complete this discovery, it remained to be shown that the electric
matter was collected entirely at the surface of the glass, and that
the opposite electricities on the two opposite sides of the glass were
accumulated by their mutual attraction. Monnier the younger discovered
that the electricity which bodies can receive, depends upon their
surface rather than their mass, and Franklin<a id="fnanchor16-11"
href="#note16-11"><span class="fnanchor">16</span></a> soon found that
“the whole force of the bottle, and power of giving a shock, is in the
glass itself.” This they proved by decanting the water out of an
electrized into another bottle, when it appeared that the second
bottle did not become electric, but the first remained so. Thus it was
found “that the non-electrics, in contact with the glass, served only
to unite the force of the several parts.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note15-11"
href="#fnanchor15-11">15</a></span> <i>Letters</i>, p. 13.</div>

<p>So far as the effect of the coating of the Leyden phial is
concerned, this was satisfactory and complete: but Franklin was not
equally successful in tracing the action of the electric matter upon
itself, in virtue of which it is accumulated in the phial; indeed, he
appears to have ascribed the effect to some property of the glass. The
mode of describing this action varied, accordingly as two electric
<em>fluids</em> were supposed (with Dufay,) or one, which was the view
taken by Franklin. On this latter supposition the parts of the
electric fluid repel each other, and the excess in one surface of the
glass expels the fluid from the other surface. This kind of action,
however, came into much clearer view in the experiments of Canton,
Wilcke, and Æpinus. It was principally manifested in the attractions
and repulsions which objects exert when they are in the neighborhood
of electrized bodies; or in the <i>electrical atmosphere</i>, using
the phraseology of the time. At present we say that bodies are
electrized <i>by induction</i>, when they are <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page198">198</a></span> thus made electric by the electric
attraction and repulsion of other bodies. Canton’s experiments were
communicated to the Royal Society in 1753, and show that the
electricity on each body acts upon the electricity of another body, at
a distance, with a repulsive energy. Wilcke, in like manner, showed
that parts of non-electrics, plunged in electric atmospheres, acquire
an electricity opposite to that of such atmospheres. And Æpinus
devised a method of examining the nature of the electricity at any
part of the surface of a body, by means of which he ascertained its
distribution, and found that it agreed with such a law of
self-repulsion. His attempt to give mathematical precision to this
induction was one of the most important steps towards electrical
theory, and must be spoken of shortly, in that point of view. But in
the mean time we may observe, that this doctrine was applied to the
explanation of the Leyden jar; and the explanation was confirmed by
charging a plate of air, and obtaining a shock from it, in a manner
which the theory pointed out.</p>
<p>Before we proceed to the history of the theory, we must mention
some other of the laws of phenomena which were noticed, and which
theory was expected to explain. Among the most celebrated of these,
were the effect of sharp points in conductors, and the phenomena of
electricity in the atmosphere. The former of these circumstances was
one of the first which Franklin observed as remarkable. It was found
that the points of needles and the like throw off and draw off the
electric virtue; thus a bodkin, directed towards an electrized ball,
at six or eight inches’ distance, destroyed its electric action. The
latter subject, involving the consideration of thunder and lightning,
and of many other meteorological phenomena, excited great interest.
The comparison of the electric spark to lightning had very early been
made; but it was only when the discharge had been rendered more
powerful in the Leyden jar, that the comparison of the effects became
very plausible. Franklin, about 1750, had offered a few somewhat vague
conjectures<a id="fnanchor17-11" href="#note17-11"><span
class="fnanchor">17</span></a> respecting the existence of electricity
in the clouds; but it was not till Wilcke and Æpinus had obtained
clear notions of the effect of electric matter at a distance, that the
real condition of the clouds could be well understood. In 1752,
however,<a id="fnanchor18-11" href="#note18-11"><span
class="fnanchor">18</span></a> D’Alibard, and other French
philosophers, were desirous of verifying Franklin’s conjecture of the
analogy of thunder and electricity. This they did by erecting a
pointed iron rod, forty feet high, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page199">199</a></span> at Marli: the rod was found capable of
giving out electrical sparks when a thunder-cloud passed over the
place. This was repeated in various parts of Europe, and Franklin
suggested that a communication with the clouds might be formed by
means of a kite. By these, and similar means, the electricity of the
atmosphere was studied by Canton in England, Mazeas in France,
Beccaria in Italy, and others elsewhere. These essays soon led to a
fatal accident, the death of Richman at Petersburg, while he was, on
Aug. 6th, 1753, observing the electricity collected from an
approaching thunder-cloud, by means of a rod which he called an
electrical gnomon: a globe of blue fire was seen to leap from the rod
to the head of the unfortunate professor, who was thus struck
dead.</p>

<p>[2nd Ed.] [As an important application of the doctrines of
electricity, I may mention the contrivances employed to protect ships
from the effects of lightning. The use of conductors in such cases is
attended with peculiar difficulties. In 1780 the French began to turn
their attention to this subject, and Le Roi was sent to Brest and the
various sea-ports of France for that purpose. Chains temporarily
applied in the rigging had been previously suggested, but he
endeavored to place, he says, such conductors in ships as might be
fixed and durable. He devised certain long linked rods, which led from
a point in the mast-head along a part of the rigging, or in divided
stages along the masts, and were fixed to plates of metal in the
ship’s sides communicating with the sea. But these were either unable
to stand the working of the rigging, or otherwise inconvenient, and
were finally abandoned.<a id="fnanchor19-11" href="#note19-11"><span
class="fnanchor">19</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note19-11"
href="#fnanchor19-11">19</a></span> See Le Roi’s Memoir in the
<i>Hist. Acad. Sc.</i> for 1790.</div>
<p>The conductor commonly used in the English Navy, till recently,
consisted of a flexible copper chain, tied, when occasion required, to
the mast-head, and reaching down into the sea; a contrivance
recommended by Dr. Watson in 1762. But notwithstanding this
precaution, the shipping suffered greatly from the effects of
lightning.</p>
<p>Mr. Snow Harris (now Sir William Snow Harris), whose electrical
labors are noticed <a href="#snow">above</a>, proposed to the
Admiralty, in 1820, a plan which combined the conditions of
ship-conductors, so desirable, yet so difficult to
secure:&#8212;namely, that they should be permanently fixed, and
sufficiently large, and yet should in no way interfere with the motion
of the rigging, or with the sliding masts. The method which he
proposed was to make the masts themselves conductors of electricity,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page200">200</a></span> by
incorporating with them, in a peculiar way, two laminæ of
sheet-copper, uniting these with the metallic masses in the hull by
other laminæ, and giving the whole a free communication with the sea.
This method was tried experimentally, both on models and to a large
extent in the navy itself; and a Commission appointed to examine the
result reported themselves highly satisfied with Mr. Harris’s plan,
and strongly recommended that it should be fully carried out in the
Navy.<a id="fnanchor20-11" href="#note20-11"><span
class="fnanchor">20</span></a>]</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note20-11"
href="#fnanchor20-11">20</a></span> See Mr. Snow Harris’s paper in
<i>Phil. Mag.</i> March, 1841.</div>
<p>It is not here necessary to trace the study of atmospheric
electricity any further: and we must now endeavor to see how these
phenomena and laws of phenomena which we have related, were worked up
into consistent theories; for though many experimental observations
and measures were made after this time, they were guided by the
theory, and may be considered as having rather discharged the office
of confirming than of suggesting it.</p>
<p>We may observe also that we have now described the period of most
extensive activity and interest in electrical researches. These
naturally occurred while the general notions and laws of the phenomena
were becoming, and were not yet become, fixed and clear. At such a
period, a large and popular circle of spectators and amateurs feel
themselves nearly upon a level, in the value of their trials and
speculations, with more profound thinkers: at a later period, when the
subject is become a science, that is, a study in which all must be
left far behind who do not come to it with disciplined, informed, and
logical minds, the cultivators are far more few, and the shout of
applause less tumultuous and less loud. We may add, too, that the
experiments, which are the most striking to the senses, lose much of
their impressiveness with their novelty. Electricity, to be now
studied rightly, must be reasoned upon mathematically; how slowly such
a mode of study makes its way, we shall see in the progress of the
theory, which we must now proceed to narrate.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [A new mode of producing electricity has excited much
notice lately. In October, 1840, one of the workmen in attendance upon
a boiler belonging to the Newcastle and Durham Railway, reported that
the boiler was full of fire; the fact  being, that when he placed his
hand near it an electrical spark was given out. This drew the
attention of Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Pattinson, who made the
circumstance publicly known.<a id="fnanchor21-11"
href="#note21-11"><span class="fnanchor">21</span></a> Mr. Armstrong
pursued the investigation <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page201">201</a></span> with great zeal, and after various
conjectures was able to announce<a id="fnanchor22-11"
href="#note22-11"><span class="fnanchor">22</span></a> that the
electricity was excited at the point where the steam is subject to
friction in its emission. He found too that he could produce a like
effect by the emission of condensed air. Following out his views, he
was able to construct, for the Polytechnic Institution in London, a
“Hydro-electric Machine,” of greater power than any electrical machine
previously made. Dr. Faraday took up the investigation as the subject
of the Eighteenth Series of his <i>Researches</i>, sent to the Royal
Society, Jan. 26, 1842; and in this he illustrated, with his usual
command of copious and luminous experiments, a like view;&#8212;that
the electricity is produced by the friction of the particles of the
water carried along by the <span class="correction" title="emended
from stream">steam</span>. And thus this is a new manifestation of
that electricity, which, to distinguish it from voltaic electricity,
is sometimes called <i>Friction Electricity</i> or <i>Machine
Electricity</i>. Dr. Faraday has, however, in the course of this
investigation, brought to light several new electrical relations of
bodies.]</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">The Progress of Electrical Theory.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> cause of electrical
phenomena, and the mode of its operation, were naturally at first
spoken of in an indistinct and wavering manner. It was called the
electric <i>fire</i>, the electric <i>fluid</i>; its effects were
attributed to <i>virtues</i>, <i>effluvia</i>, <i>atmospheres</i>.
When men’s mechanical ideas became somewhat more distinct, the motions
and tendencies to motion were ascribed to <i>currents</i>, in the same
manner as the cosmical motions had been in the Cartesian system. This
doctrine of currents was maintained by Nollet, who ascribed all the
phenomena of electrized bodies to the contemporaneous afflux and
efflux of electrical matter. It was an important step towards sound
theory, to get rid of this notion of moving fluids, and to consider
attraction and repulsion as statical forces; and this appears to have
been done by others about the same time. Dufay<a id="fnanchor23-11"
href="#note23-11"><span class="fnanchor">23</span></a> considered that
he had proved the existence of two electricities, the vitreous and the
resinous, and conceived each <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page202">202</a></span> of these to be a fluid which repelled
its own parts and attracted those of the other: this is, in fact, the
outline of the theory which recently has been considered as the best
established; but from various causes it was not at once, or at least
not generally adopted. The hypothesis of the excess and defect of a
single fluid is capable of being so treated as to give the same
results with the hypothesis of two opposite fluids and happened to
obtain the preference for some time. We have already seen that this
hypothesis, according to which electric phenomena arose from the
excess and defect of a generally diffused fluid, suggested itself to
Watson and Franklin about 1747. Watson found that when an electric
body was excited, the electricity was not created, but collected; and
Franklin held, that when the Leyden jar was charged, the quantity of
electricity was unaltered, though its distribution was changed.
Symmer<a id="fnanchor24-11" href="#note24-11"><span
class="fnanchor">24</span></a> maintained the existence of two fluids;
and Cigna supplied the main defect which belonged to this tenet in the
way in which Dufay held it, by showing that the two opposite
electricities were usually produced at the same time. Still the
apparent simplicity of the hypothesis of one fluid procured it many
supporters. It was that which Franklin adopted, in his explanation of
the Leyden experiment; and though after the first conception of an
electrical charge as a disturbance of equilibrium, there was nothing
in the development or details of Franklin’s views which deserved to
win for them any peculiar authority, his reputation, and his skill as
a writer, gave a considerable influence to his opinions. Indeed, for a
time he was considered, over a large part of Europe, as the creator of
the science, and the terms<a id="fnanchor25-11"
href="#note25-11"><span class="fnanchor">25</span></a>
<i>Franklinism</i>, <i>Franklinist</i>, <i>Franklinian system</i>,
occur in almost every page of continental publications on the subject.
Yet the electrical phenomena to the knowledge of which Franklin added
least, those of induction, were those by which the progress of the
theory was most promoted. These, as we have already said, were at
first explained by the hypothesis of electrical atmospheres. Lord
Mahon wrote a treatise, in which this hypothesis was mathematically
treated; yet the hypothesis was very untenable, for it would not
account for the most obvious cases of induction, such as the Leyden
jar, except the atmosphere was supposed to penetrate glass.</p>

<p>The phenomena of electricity by induction, when fairly considered
by a person of clear notions of the relations of space and force, were
seen to accommodate themselves very generally to the conception <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page203">203</a></span> introduced by
Dufay;<a id="fnanchor26-11" href="#note26-11"><span
class="fnanchor">26</span></a> of two electricities each repelling
itself and attracting the other. If we suppose that there is only one
fluid, which repels itself and attracts all other matter, we obtain,
in many cases, the same general results as if we suppose two fluids;
thus, if an electrized body, overcharged with the single fluid, act
upon a ball, it drives the electric fluid in the ball to the further
side by its repulsion, and then attracts the ball by attracting the
matter of the ball more than it repels the fluid which is upon the
ball. If we suppose two fluids, the positively electrized body draws
the negative fluid to the nearer side of the ball, repels the positive
fluid to the opposite side, and attracts the ball on the whole,
because the attracted fluid is nearer than that which is repelled. The
verification of either of these hypotheses, and the determination of
their details, depended necessarily upon experiment and calculation.
It was under the hypothesis of a single fluid that this trial was
first properly made. Æpinus of Petersburg published, in 1759, his
<i>Tentamen Theoriæ Electricitatis et Magnetismi</i>; in which he
traces mathematically the consequences of the hypothesis of an
electric fluid, attracting all other matter, but repelling itself; the
law of force of this repulsion and attraction he did not pretend to
assign precisely, confining himself to the supposition that the mutual
force of the particles increases as the distance decreases. But it was
found, that in order to make this theory tenable, an additional
supposition was required, namely, that the particles of bodies repel
each other as much as they attract the electric fluid.<a
id="fnanchor27-11" href="#note27-11"><span
class="fnanchor">27</span></a> For if two bodies, A and B, be in their
natural electrical condition, they neither attract nor repel each
other. Now, in this case, the fluid in A attracts the matter in B and
repels the fluid in B with equal energy, and thus no tendency to
motion results from the fluid in A; and if we further suppose that the
<em>matter</em> in A attracts the fluid in B and <em>repels the
matter</em> in B with equal energy, we have the resulting mutual
inactivity of the two bodies explained; but without the latter
supposition, there would be a mutual attraction: or we may put the
truth more simply thus; two negatively electrized bodies repel each
other; if negative electrization were merely the abstraction of the
fluid which is the repulsive element, this result could not follow
except there were a repulsion in the bodies themselves, independent of
the fluid. And thus Æpinus found himself compelled to assume this
mutual repulsion of material particles; he had, in fact, the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page204">204</a></span> alternative of this
supposition, or that of two fluids, to choose between, for the
mathematical results of both hypotheses are the same. Wilcke, a Swede,
who had at first asserted and worked out the Æpinian theory in its
original form, afterwards inclined to the opinion of Symmer; and
Coulomb, when, at a later period, he confirmed the theory by his
experiments and determined the law of force, did not hesitate to
prefer<a id="fnanchor28-11" href="#note28-11"><span
class="fnanchor">28</span></a> the theory of two fluids, “because,” he
says, “it appears to me contradictory to admit at the same time, in
the particles of bodies, an attractive force in the inverse ratio of
the squares of the distances, which is demonstrated by universal
gravitation, and a repulsive force in the same inverse ratio of the
squares of the distances; a force which would necessarily be
infinitely great relatively to the action of gravitation.” We may add,
that by forcing us upon this doctrine of the universal repulsion of
matter, the theory of a single fluid seems quite to lose that
superiority in the way of simplicity which had originally been its
principal recommendation.</p>

<p>The mathematical results of the supposition of Æpinus, which are,
as Coulomb observes,<a id="fnanchor29-11" href="#note29-11"><span
class="fnanchor">29</span></a> the same as of that of the two fluids,
were traced by the author himself in the work referred to, and shown
to agree, in a great number of cases, with the observed facts of
electrical induction, attraction, and repulsion. Apparently this work
did not make its way very rapidly through Europe; for in 1771, Henry
Cavendish stated<a id="fnanchor30-11" href="#note30-11"><span
class="fnanchor">30</span></a> the same hypothesis in a paper read
before the Royal Society; which he prefaces by saying, “Since I first
wrote the following paper, I find that this way of accounting for the
phenomena of electricity is not new. Æpinus, in his <i>Tentamen
Theoriæ Electricitatis et Magnetismi</i>, has made use of the same, or
nearly the same hypothesis that I have; and the conclusions he draws
from it agree nearly with mine as far as he goes.”</p>

href="#fnanchor30-11">30</a></span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1771, vol.

<p>The confirmation of the theory was, of course, to be found in the
agreement of its results with experiment; and in particular, in the
facts of electrical induction, attraction, and repulsion, which
suggested the theory. Æpinus showed that such a confirmation appeared
in a number of the most obvious cases; and to these, Cavendish added
others, which, though not obvious, were of such a nature that the
calculations, in general difficult or impossible, could in these
instances be easily performed; as, for example, cases in which there
are plates or globes at the two extremities of a long wire. In all
these cases of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page205">205</a></span>
electrical action the theory was justified. But in order to give it
full confirmation, it was to be considered whether any other facts,
not immediately assumed in the foundation of the theory, were
explained by it; a circumstance which, as we have seen, gave the final
stamp of truth to the theories of astronomy and optics. Now we appear
to have such confirmation, in the effect of points, and in the
phenomena of the electrical discharge. The theory of neither of these
was fully understood by Cavendish, but he made an approach to the true
view of them. If one part of a conducting body be a sphere of small
radius, the electric fluid upon the surface of this sphere will, it
appears by calculation, be more dense, and tend to escape more
energetically, in proportion as the radius of the sphere is smaller;
and, therefore, if we consider a point as part of the surface of a
sphere of imperceptible radius, it follows from the theory that the
effort of the fluid to escape at that place will be enormous; so that
it may easily be supposed to overcome the resisting causes. And the
discharge may be explained in nearly the same manner; for when a
conductor is brought nearer and nearer to an electrized body, the
opposite electricity is more and more accumulated by attraction on the
side next to the electrized body; its tension becomes greater by the
increase of its quantity and the diminution of the distance, and at
last it is too strong to be contained, and leaps out in the form of a
spark.</p>
<p>The light, sound, and mechanical effects produced by the electric
discharge, made the electric <i>fluid</i> to be not merely considered
as a mathematical hypothesis, useful for reducing phenomena to formulæ
(as for a long time the magnetic fluid was), but caused it to be at
once and universally accepted as a physical reality, of which we learn
the existence by the common use of the senses, and of which measures
and calculations are only wanted to teach us the laws.</p>
<p>The applications of the theory of electricity which I have
principally considered above, are those which belong to conductors, in
which the electric fluid is perfectly moveable, and can take that
distribution which the forces require. In non-conducting or electric
bodies, the conditions to which the fluid is subject are less easy to
determine; but by supposing that the fluid moves with great difficulty
among the particles of such bodies,&#8212;that nevertheless it may be
dislodged and accumulated in parts of the surface of such bodies, by
friction and other modes of excitement; and that the earth is an
inexhaustible reservoir of electric matter,&#8212;the principal facts
of excitation and the like receive a tolerably satisfactory
explanation. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page206">206</a></span></p>
<p>The theory of Æpinus, however, still required to have the law of
action of the particles of the fluid determined. If we were to call to
mind how momentous an event in physical astronomy was the
determination of the law of the cosmical forces, the inverse square of
the distance, and were to suppose the importance and difficulty of the
analogous step in this case to be of the same kind, this would be to
mistake the condition of science at that time. The leading idea, the
conception of the possibility of explaining natural phenomena by means
of the action of forces, on rigorously mechanical principles, had
already been promulgated by Newton, and was, from the first, seen to
be peculiarly applicable to electrical phenomena; so that the very
material step of clearly proposing the problem, often more important
than the solution of it, had already been made. Moreover the
confirmation of the truth of the assumed cause in the astronomical
case depended on taking the right law; but the electrical theory could
be confirmed, in a general manner at least, without this restriction.
Still it was an important discovery that the law of the inverse square
prevailed in these as well as in cosmical attractions.</p>
<p>It was impossible not to conjecture beforehand that it would be so.
Cavendish had professed in his calculations not to take the exponent
of the inverse power, on which the force depended, to be strictly 2,
but to leave it indeterminate between 1 and 3; but in his applications
of his results, he obviously inclines to the assumption that it is 2.
Experimenters tried to establish this in various ways. Robison,<a
id="fnanchor31-11" href="#note31-11"><span
class="fnanchor">31</span></a> in 1769, had already proved that the
law of force is very nearly or exactly the inverse square; and Meyer<a
id="fnanchor32-11" href="#note32-11"><span
class="fnanchor">32</span></a> had discovered, but not published, the
same result. The clear and satisfactory establishment of this truth is
due to Coulomb, and was one of the first steps in his important series
of researches on this subject. In his first paper<a id="fnanchor33-11"
href="#note33-11"><span class="fnanchor">33</span></a> in the
<i>Memoirs</i> of the Academy for 1785, he proves this law for small
globes; in his second Memoir he shows it to be true for globes one and
two feet in diameter. His invention of the <i>torsion-balance</i>,
which measures very small forces with great certainty and exactness,
enabled him to set this question at rest for ever.</p>

<p>The law of force being determined for the particles of the electric
fluid, it now came to be the business of the experimenter and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page207">207</a></span> mathematician
to compare the results of the theory in detail with those of
experimental measures. Coulomb undertook both portions of the task. He
examined the electricity of portions of bodies by means of a little
disk (his <i>tangent plane</i>) which he applied to them and then
removed, and which thus acted as a sort of electric <i>taster</i>. His
numerical results (the intensity being still measured by the
torsion-balance) are the fundamental facts of the theory of the
electrical fluid. Without entering into detail, we may observe that he
found the electricity to be entirely collected at the surface of
conductors (which Beccaria had before shown to be the case), and that
he examined and recorded the electric intensity at the surface of
globes, cylinders, and other conducting bodies, placed within each
other’s influence in various ways.</p>
<p>The mathematical calculation of the distribution of two fluids, all
the particles of which attract and repel each other according to the
above law, was a problem of no ordinary difficulty; as may easily be
imagined, when it is recollected that the attraction and repulsion
determine the distribution, and the distribution reciprocally
determines the attraction and repulsion. The problem was of the same
nature as that of the figure of the earth; and its rigorous solution
was beyond the powers of the analysis of Coulomb’s time. He obtained,
however, approximate solutions with much ingenuity; for instance, in a
case in which it was obvious that the electric fluid would be most
accumulated at and near the equator of a certain sphere, he calculated
the action of the sphere on two suppositions: first, that the fluid
was all collected precisely at the equator; and next, that it was
uniformly diffused over the surface; and he then assumed the actual
case to be intermediate between these two. By such artifices he was
able to show that the results of his experiments and of his
calculations gave an agreement sufficiently near to entitle him to
consider the theory as established on a solid basis.</p>
<p>Thus, at this period, mathematics was behind experiment; and a
problem was proposed, in which theoretical numerical results were
wanted for comparison with observation, but could not be accurately
obtained; as was the case in astronomy also, till the time of the
approximate solution of the Problem of Three Bodies, and the
consequent formation of the Tables of the Moon and Planets on the
theory of universal gravitation. After some time, electrical theory
was relieved from this reproach, mainly in consequence of the progress
which astronomy had occasioned in pure mathematics. About 1801, <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page208">208</a></span> there appeared in the
<i>Bulletin des Sciences</i>,<a id="fnanchor34-11"
href="#note34-11"><span class="fnanchor">34</span></a> an exact
solution of the problem of the distribution of electric fluid on a
spheroid, obtained by M. Biot, by the application of the peculiar
methods which Laplace had invented for the problem of the figure of
the planets. And in 1811, M. Poisson applied Laplace’s artifices to
the case of two spheres acting upon one another in contact, a case to
which many of Coulomb’s experiments were referrible; and the agreement
of the results of theory and observation, thus extricated from
Coulomb’s numbers, obtained above forty years previously, was very
striking and convincing.<a id="fnanchor35-11" href="#note35-11"><span
class="fnanchor">35</span></a> It followed also from Poisson’s
calculations, that when two electrized spheres are brought near each
other, the accumulation of the opposite electricities on their nearest
points increases without limit as the spheres approach to contact; so
that before the contact takes place, the external resistance will be
overcome, and a <i>spark</i> will pass.</p>

<p>Though the relations of non-conductors to electricity, and various
other circumstances, leave many facts imperfectly explained by the
theory, yet we may venture to say that, as a theory which gives the
laws of the phenomena, and which determines the distribution of those
elementary forces, on the surface of electrized bodies, from which
elementary forces (whether arising from the presence of a fluid or
not,) the total effects result, the doctrine of Dufay and Coulomb, as
developed in the analysis of Poisson, is securely and permanently
established. This part of the subject has been called <i>statical
electricity</i>. In the establishment of the theory of this branch of
science, we must, I conceive, allow to Dufay more merit than is
generally ascribed to him; since he saw clearly, and enunciated in a
manner which showed that he duly appreciated their capital character,
the two chief principles,&#8212;the conditions of electrical
attraction and repulsion, and the apparent existence of two kinds of
electricity. His views of attraction are, indeed, partly expressed in
terms of the Cartesian hypothesis of vortices, then prevalent in
France; but, at the time when he wrote, these forms of speech
indicated scarcely anything besides the power of attraction.
Franklin’s real merit as a discoverer was, that he was one of the
first who distinctly conceived the electrical <i>charge</i> as a
derangement of equilibrium. The great fame which, in his day, he
enjoyed, arose from the clearness and spirit with which he narrated
his discoveries; from his dealing with electricity in the imposing
form of thunder and lightning; and partly, perhaps, from his character
as an <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page209">209</a></span> American
and a politician; for he was already, in 1736, engaged in public
affairs as clerk to the General Assembly of Pennsylvania, though it
was not till a later period of his life that his admirers had the
occasion of saying of him</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Æpinus and Coulomb were two of the most eminent physical
philosophers of the last century, and labored in the way peculiarly
required by that generation; whose office it was to examine the
results, in particular subjects, of the general conception of
attraction and repulsion, as introduced by Newton. The reasonings of
the Newtonian period had, in some measure, anticipated all possible
theories resembling the electrical doctrine of Æpinus and Coulomb;
and, on that account, this doctrine could not be introduced and
confirmed in a sudden and striking manner, so as to make a great
epoch. Accordingly, Dufay, Symmer, Watson, Franklin, Æpinus and
Coulomb, have all a share in the process of induction. With reference
to these founders of the theory of electricity, Poisson holds the same
place which Laplace holds with reference to Newton.</p>
<p id="snow">The reception of the Coulombian theory (so we most call
it, for the Æpinian theory implies one fluid only,) has hitherto not
been so general as might have been reasonably expected from its very
beautiful accordance with the facts which it contemplates. This has
partly been owing to the extreme abstruseness of the mathematical
reasoning which it employs, and which put it out of the reach of most
experimenters and writers of works of general circulation. The theory
of Æpinus was explained by Robison in the <i>Encyclopædia
Britannica</i>; the analysis of Poisson has recently been presented to
the public in the <i>Encyclopædia Metropolitana</i>, but is of a kind
not easily mastered even by most mathematicians. On these accounts
probably it is, that in English compilations of science, we find, even
to this day, the two theories of one and of two fluids stated as if
they were nearly on a par in respect of their experimental evidence.
Still we may say that the Coulombian theory is probably assented to by
all who have examined it, at least as giving the laws of phenomena;
and I have not heard of any denial of it from such a quarter, or of
any attempt to show it to be erroneous by detailed and measured
experiments. Mr. Snow Harris <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page210">210</a></span> has recently<a id="fnanchor36-11"
href="#note36-11"><span class="fnanchor">36</span></a> described some
important experiments and measures; but his apparatus was of such a
kind that the comparison of the results with the Coulombian theory was
not easy; and indeed the mathematical problems which Mr. Harris’s
combinations offered, require another Poisson for their solution.
Still the more obvious results are such as agree with the theory, even
in the cases in which their author considered them to be inexplicable.
For example, he found that by doubling the quantity of electricity of
a conductor, it attracted a body with four times the force; but the
body not being insulated, would have its electricity also doubled by
induction, and thus the fact was what the theory required.</p>

<p>Though it is thus highly probable that the Coulombian theory of
electricity (or the Æpinian, which is mathematically equivalent) will
stand as a true representation of the law of the elementary actions,
we must yet allow that it has not received that complete evidence, by
means of experiments and calculations added to those of its founders,
which the precedents of other permanent sciences have led us to look
for. The experiments of Coulomb, which he used in the establishment of
the theory, were not very numerous, and they were limited to a
peculiar form of bodies, namely spheres. In order to form the proper
<i>sequel</i> to the promulgation of this theory, to give a full
<i>confirmation</i>, and to ensure its general <i>reception</i>, we
ought to have experiments more numerous and more varied (such as those
of Mr. Harris are) shown to agree in all respects with results
calculated from the theory. This would, as we have said, be a task of
labor and difficulty; but the person who shall execute it will deserve
to be considered as one of the real founders of the true doctrine of
electricity. To show that the coincidence between theory and
observation, which has already been proved for spherical conductors,
obtains also for bodies of other forms, will be a step in electricity
analogous to what was done in astronomy, when it was shown that the
law of gravitation applied to comets as well as to planets.</p>
<p>But although we consider the views of Æpinus or Coulomb in a very
high degree probable as a <i>formal theory</i>, the question is very
different when we come to examine them as a <i>physical
theory</i>;&#8212;that is, when we inquire whether there really is a
material electric fluid or fluids.</p>
<p><i>Question of One or Two Fluids.</i>&#8212;In the first place as
to the question whether the fluids are one or two;&#8212;Coulomb’s
introduction of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page211">211</a></span>
the hypothesis of two fluids has been spoken of as a reform of the
theory of Æpinus; it would probably have been more safe to have called
his labors an advance in the calculation, and in the comparison of
hypothesis with experiment, than to have used language which implied
that the question, between the rival hypotheses of one or two fluids,
could be treated as settled. For, in reality, if we assume, as Æpinus
does, the mutual repulsion of all the particles of matter, in addition
to the repulsion of the particles of the electric fluid for one
another and their attraction for the particles of matter, the one
fluid of Æpinus will give exactly the same results as the two fluids
of Coulomb. The mathematical formulæ of Coulomb and of Poisson express
the conditions of the one case as well as of the other; the
interpretation only being somewhat different. The place of the forces
of the resinous fluid is supplied by the excess of the forces ascribed
to the matter above the forces of the fluid, in the parts where the
electric fluid is deficient.</p>
<p>The obvious argument against this hypothesis is, that we ascribe to
the particles of matter a mutual repulsion, in addition to the mutual
attraction of universal gravitation, and that this appears
incongruous. Accordingly, Æpinus says, that when he was first driven
to this proposition it horrified him.<a id="fnanchor37-11"
href="#note37-11"><span class="fnanchor">37</span></a> But we may
answer it in this way very satisfactorily:&#8212;If we suppose the
mutual repulsion of matter to be somewhat less than the mutual
attraction of matter and electric fluid, it will follow, as a
consequence of the hypothesis, that besides all obvious electrical
action, the particles of matter would attract each other with forces
varying inversely as the square of the distance. Thus gravitation
itself becomes an electrical phenomenon, arising from the residual
excess of attraction over repulsion; and the fact which is urged
against the hypothesis becomes a confirmation of it. By this
consideration the prerogative of simplicity passes over to the side of
the hypothesis of one fluid; and the rival view appears to lose at
least all its superiority.</p>

offerret . . . . me ad ipsam quodammodo  exhorruisse. <i>Tentamen
Theor. Elect.</i> p. 39.</div>
<p>Very recently, M. Mosotti<a id="fnanchor38-11"
href="#note38-11"><span class="fnanchor">38</span></a> has calculated
the results of the Æpinian theory in a far more complete manner than
had previously been performed; using Laplace’s coefficients, as
Poisson had done for the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page212">212</a></span> Coulombian theory. He finds that, from
the supposition of a fluid and of particles of matter exercising such
forces as that theory assumes (with the very allowable additional
supposition that the particles are small compared with their
distances), it follows that the particles would exert a force,
repulsive at the smallest distances, a little further on vanishing,
afterwards attractive, and at all sensible distances attracting in
proportion to the inverse square of the distance. Thus there would be
a position of stable equilibrium for the particles at a very small
distance from each other, which may be, M. Mosotti suggests, that
equilibrium on which their physical structure depends. According to
this view, the resistance of bodies to compression and to extension,
as well as the phenomena of statical electricity and the mutual
gravitation of matter, are accounted for by the same hypothesis of a
single fluid or ether. A theory which offers a prospect of such a
generalization is worth attention; but a very clear and comprehensive
view of the doctrines of several sciences is requisite to prepare us
to estimate its value and probable success.</p>

<p><i>Question of the Material Reality of the Electric
Fluid.</i>&#8212;At first sight the beautiful accordance of the
experiments with calculations founded upon the attractions and
repulsions of the two hypothetical fluids, persuade us that the
hypotheses must be the real state of things. But we have already
learned that we must not trust to such evidence too readily. It is a
curious instance of the mutual influence of the histories of two
provinces of science, but I think it will be allowed to be just, to
say that the discovery of the polarization of heat has done much to
shake the theory of the electric fluids as a physical reality. For the
doctrine of a material caloric appeared to be proved (from the laws of
conduction and radiation) by the same kind of mathematical evidence
(the agreement of laws respecting the elementary actions with those of
fluids), which we have for the doctrine of material electricity. Yet
we now seem to see that heat cannot be matter, since its rays have
<em>sides</em>, in a manner in which a stream of particles of matter
cannot have sides without inadmissible hypotheses. We see, then, that
it will not be contrary to precedent, if our electrical theory,
representing with perfect accuracy the <em>laws</em> of the actions,
in all their forms, simple and complex, should yet be fallacious as a
view of the <em>cause</em> of the actions.</p>
<p>Any true view of electricity must include, or at least be
consistent with, the other classes of the phenomena, as well as this
statical electrical action; such as the conditions of excitation and
retention of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page213">213</a></span>
electricity; to which we may add, the connexion of electricity with
magnetism and with chemistry;&#8212;a vast field, as yet dimly seen.
Now, even with regard to the simplest of these questions, the cause of
the retention of electricity at the surface of bodies, it appears to
be impossible to maintain Coulomb’s opinion, that this is effected by
the resistance of air to the passage of electricity. The other
questions are such as Coulomb did not attempt to touch; they refer,
indeed, principally to laws not suspected at his time. How wide and
profound a theory must be which deals worthily with these, we shall
obtain some indications in the succeeding part of our history.</p>
<p>But it may be said on the other side, that we have the evidence of
our senses for the reality of an electric fluid;&#8212;we see it in
the spark; we hear it in the explosion; we feel it in the shock; and
it produces the effects of mechanical violence, piercing and tearing
the bodies through which it passes. And those who are disposed to
assert a real fluid on such grounds, may appear to be justified in
doing so, by one of Newton’s “Rules of Philosophizing,” in which he
directs the philosopher to assume, in his theories, “causes which are
true.” The usual interpretation of a “vera causa,” has been, that it
implies causes which, independently of theoretical calculations, are
known to exist by their mechanical effects; as gravity was familiarly
known to exist on the earth, before it was extended to the heavens.
The electric fluid might seem to be such a <i>vera causa</i>.</p>
<p>To this I should venture to reply, that this reasoning shows how
delusive the Newtonian rule, so interpreted, may be. For a moment’s
consideration will satisfy us that none of the circumstances, above
adduced, can really prove material currents, rather than vibrations,
or other modes of agency. The spark and shock are quite insufficient
to supply such a proof. Sound is vibrations,&#8212;light is
vibrations; vibrations may affect our nerves, and may rend a body, as
when glasses are broken by sounds. Therefore all these supposed
indications of the reality of the electric fluid are utterly
fallacious. In truth, this mode of applying Newton’s rule consists in
elevating our first rude and unscientific impressions into a supremacy
over the results of calculation, generalization, and systematic
induction.<span class="correction" title="same number as the preceding

Newtonian Rule of Philosophizing, see further <i>Phil. Ind. Sc.</i> B.
xii. c. 13. I have given an account of the history and evidence of the
Theory of Electricity in the <i>Reports of the British Association</i>
for 1835. I may seem there to have spoken more favorably of the Theory
as a Physical Theory than I have done here. This difference is
principally due to a consideration of the present aspect of the Theory
of Heat.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page214">214</a></span> Thus our
conclusion with regard to this subject is, that if we wish to form a
stable physical theory of electricity, we must take into account not
only the laws of statical electricity, which we have been chiefly
considering, but the laws of other kinds of agency, different from the
electric, yet connected with it. For the electricity of which we have
hitherto spoken, and which is commonly excited by friction, is
identical with galvanic action, which is a result of chemical
combinations, and belongs to chemical philosophy. The connexion of
these different kinds of electricity with one another leads us into a
new domain; but we must, in the first place, consider their mechanical
laws. We now proceed to another branch of the same subject,
Magnetism.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Discovery of Laws of Magnetic Phenomena.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> history of Magnetism is in
a great degree similar to that of Electricity, and many of the same
persons were employed in the two trains of research. The general fact,
that the magnet attracts iron, was nearly all that was known to the
ancients, and is frequently mentioned and referred to; for instance,
by Pliny, who wonders and declaims concerning it, in his usual
exaggerated style.<a id="fnanchor1-12" href="#note1-12"><span
class="fnanchor">1</span></a> The writers of the Stationary Period, in
this subject as in others, employed themselves in collecting and
adorning a number of extravagant tales, which the slightest reference
to experiment would have disproved; as, for example, that a magnet,
when it has lost its virtue, has it restored by goat’s blood. Gilbert,
whose work <i>De Magnete</i> we have <a href="#v2page192">already</a>
mentioned, speaks with becoming indignation and pity of this bookish
folly, and repeatedly asserts the paramount value of experiments. He
himself, no doubt, acted up to his own precepts; for his work contains
all the fundamental facts of the science, so fully examined indeed,
that even at this day we have little to add to them. Thus, in his
first Book, the subjects of the third, fourth, and fifth Chapters
are,&#8212;that the magnet has poles,&#8212;that we may call these
poles the north and the south pole,&#8212;that in two magnets the
north pole of each attracts the south pole and repels the north pole
of the other. This is, indeed, the cardinal fact on which our
generalizations rest; and the reader will perceive at once its
resemblance to the leading phenomena of statical electricity.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-12"
href="#fnanchor1-12">1</a></span> <i>Hist. Nat.</i> lib. xxxvi. c.
25.</div>
<p>But the doctrines of magnetism, like those of heat, have an
additional claim on our notice from the manner in which they are
exemplified in the globe of the earth. The subject of <i>terrestrial
magnetism</i> forms a very important addition to the general facts of
magnetic attraction and repulsion. The property of the magnet by which
it directs its poles exactly or nearly north and south, when once
discovered, was of immense importance to the mariner. It does not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page218">218</a></span> appear easy to
trace with certainty the period of this discovery. Passing over
certain legends of the Chinese, as at any rate not bearing upon the
progress of European science,<a id="fnanchor2-12"
href="#note2-12"><span class="fnanchor">2</span></a> the earliest
notice of this property appears to be contained in the Poem of Guyot
de Provence, who describes the needle as being magnetized, and then
placed in or on a straw, (floating on water, as I presume:)</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Puis se torne la pointe toute</span><br />
<span class="i0">Contre l’estoile sans doute;</span><br /></div></div>
<p class="noind">that is, it turns towards the pole-star. This account
would make the knowledge of this property in Europe anterior to 1200.
It was afterwards found<a id="fnanchor3-12" href="#note3-12"><span
class="fnanchor">3</span></a> that the needle does not point exactly
towards the north. Gilbert was aware of this deviation, which he calls
the <i>variation</i>, and also, that it is different in different
places.<a id="fnanchor4-12" href="#note4-12"><span
class="fnanchor">4</span></a> He maintained on theoretical principles
also,<a id="fnanchor5-12" href="#note5-12"><span
class="fnanchor">5</span></a> that at the same place the variation is
constant; probably in his time there were not any recorded
observations by which the truth of this assertion could be tested; it
was afterwards found to be false. The alteration of the variation in
proceeding from one place to another was, it will be recollected, one
of the circumstances which most alarmed the companions of Columbus in
1492. Gilbert says,<a id="fnanchor6-12" href="#note6-12"><span
class="fnanchor">6</span></a> “Other learned men have, in long
navigations, observed the differences of magnetic variations, as
Thomas Hariot, Robert Hues, Edward Wright, Abraham Kendall, all
Englishmen: others have invented magnetic instruments and convenient
modes of observation, such as are requisite for those who take long
voyages, as William Borough in his Book concerning the variation of
the compass, William Barlo in his supplement, William Norman in his
<i>New Attractive</i>. This is that Robert Norman (a good seaman and
an ingenious artificer,) who first discovered the <i>dip</i> of
magnetic iron.” This important discovery was made<a id="fnanchor7-12"
href="#note7-12"><span class="fnanchor">7</span></a> in 1576. From the
time when the difference of the variation of the compass in different
places became known, it was important to mariners to register the
variation in all parts of the world. Halley was appointed to the
command of a ship in the Royal Navy by the Government of William and
Mary, with orders “to seek by observation the discovery of the rule
for the variation of the compass.” He published Magnetic Charts, which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page219">219</a></span> have been since
corrected and improved by various persons. The most recent are those
of Mr. Yates in 1817, and of M. Hansteen. The dip, as well as the
variation, was found to be different in different places. M. Humboldt,
in the course of his travels, collected many such observations. And
both the observations of variation and of dip seemed to indicate that
the earth, as to its effect on the magnetic needle, may, approximately
at least, be considered as a magnet, the poles of which are not far
removed from the earth’s poles of rotation. Thus we have a <i>magnetic
equator</i>, in which the needle has no dip, and which does not
deviate far from the earth’s equator; although, from the best
observations, it appears to be by no means a regular circle. And the
phenomena, both of the dip and of the variation, in high northern
latitudes, appear to indicate the existence of a pole below the
surface of the earth to the north of Hudson’s Bay. In his second
remarkable expedition into those regions, Captain Ross is supposed to
have reached the place of this pole; the dipping-needle there pointing
vertically downwards, and the variation-compass turning towards this
point in the adjacent regions. We shall <a
href="#terrestrial">hereafter</a> have to consider the more complete
and connected views which have been taken of terrestrial
magnetism.</p>

<p>In 1633, Gellibrand discovered that the variation is not constant,
as Gilbert imagined, but that at London it had diminished from eleven
degrees east in 1580, to four degrees in 1633. Since that time the
variation has become more and more westerly; it is now about
twenty-five degrees west, and the needle is supposed to have begun to
travel eastward again.</p>
<p>The next important fact which appeared with respect to terrestrial
magnetism was, that the position of the needle is subject to a small
<em>diurnal</em> variation: this was discovered in 1722, by Graham, a
philosophical instrument-maker, of London. The daily variation was
established by one thousand observations of Graham, and confirmed by
four thousand more made by Canton, and is now considered to be out of
dispute. It appeared also, by Canton’s researches, that the diurnal
variation undergoes an annual inequality, being nearly a quarter of a
degree in June and July, and only half that quantity in December and
January.</p>
<p>Having thus noticed the principal facts which belong to terrestrial
magnetism, we must return to the consideration of those phenomena
which gradually led to a consistent magnetic theory. Gilbert observed
that both smelted iron and hammered iron have the magnetic virtue,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page220">220</a></span> though in a
weaker degree than the magnet itself,<a id="fnanchor8-12"
href="#note8-12"><span class="fnanchor">8</span></a> and he asserted
distinctly that the magnet is merely an ore of iron, (lib. i. c. 16,
Quod magnes et vena ferri idem sunt.) He also noted the increased
energy which magnets acquire by being <i>armed</i>; that is, fitted
with a cap of polished iron at each pole.<a id="fnanchor9-12"
href="#note9-12"><span class="fnanchor">9</span></a> But we do not
find till a later period any notice of the distinction which exists
between the magnetical properties of soft iron and of hard
steel;&#8212;the latter being susceptible of being formed into
<i>artificial magnets</i>, with permanent poles; while soft iron is
only <i>passively magnetic</i>, receiving a temporary polarity from
the action of a magnet near it, but losing this property when the
magnet is removed. About the middle of the last century, various
methods were devised of making artificial magnets, which exceeded in
power all magnetic bodies previously known.</p>

<p>The remaining experimental researches had so close an historical
connexion with the theory, that they will be best considered along
with it, and to that, therefore, we now proceed.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Progress of Magnetic Theory.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">Theory of Magnetic
Action.</span>&#8212;The assumption of a fluid, as a mode of
explaining the phenomena, was far less obvious in magnetic than in
electric cases, yet it was soon arrived at. After the usual philosophy
of the middle ages, the “forms” of Aquinas, the “efflux” of Cusanus,
the “vapors” of Costæus, and the like, which are recorded by
Gilbert,<a id="fnanchor10-12" href="#note10-12"><span
class="fnanchor">10</span></a> we have his own theory, which he also
expresses by ascribing the effects to a “formal efficiency;”&#8212;a
“<i>form</i> of primary globes; the proper entity and existence of
their homogeneous parts, which we may call a primary and radical and
astral <i>form</i>;”&#8212;of which forms there is one in the sun, one
in the moon, one in the earth, the latter being the magnetic
virtue.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note10-12"
href="#fnanchor10-12">10</a></span> Gilb. lib. ii. c. 3, 4</div>
<p>Without attempting to analyse the precise import of these
expressions, we may proceed to Descartes’s explanation of magnetic
phenomena. The mode in which he presents this subject<a
id="fnanchor11-12" href="#note11-12"><span
class="fnanchor">11</span></a> is, perhaps, the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page221">221</a></span> most persuasive of
his physical attempts. If a magnet be placed among iron filings, these
arrange themselves in curved lines, which proceed from one pole of the
magnet to the other. It was not difficult to conceive these to be the
traces of currents of ethereal matter which circulate through the
magnet, and which are thus rendered sensible even to the eye. When
phenomena could not be explained by means of one vortex, several were
introduced. Three Memoirs on Magnetism, written on such principles,
had the prize adjudged<a id="fnanchor12-12" href="#note12-12"><span
class="fnanchor">12</span></a> by the French Academy of Sciences in
1746.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note11-12"

href="#fnanchor12-12">12</a></span> Coulomb, 1789, p. 482.</div>
<p>But the Cartesian philosophy gradually declined; and it was not
difficult to show that the <i>magnetic curves</i>, as well as other
phenomena, would, in fact, result from the attraction and repulsion of
two poles. The analogy of magnetism with electricity was so strong and
clear, that similar theories were naturally proposed for the two sets
of facts; the distinction of bodies into conductors and electrics in
the one case, corresponding to the distinction of soft and hard steel,
in their relations to magnetism. Æpinus published a theory of
magnetism and electricity at the same time (1759); and the former
theory, like the latter, explained the phenomena of the opposite poles
as results of the excess and defect of a magnetic “fluid,” which was
dislodged and accumulated in the ends of the body, by the repulsion of
its own particles, and by the attraction of iron or steel, as in the
case of induced electricity. The Æpinian theory of magnetism, as of
electricity, was recast by Coulomb, and presented in a new shape, with
two fluids instead of one. But before this theory was reduced to
calculation, it was obviously desirable, in the first place, to
determine the law of force.</p>
<p>In magnetic, as in electric action, the determination of the law of
attraction of the particles was attended at first with some
difficulty, because the action which a finite magnet exerts is a
compound result of the attractions and repulsions of many points.
Newton had imagined the attractive force of magnetism to be inversely
as the cube of the distance; but Mayer in 1760, and Lambert a few
years later, asserted the law to be, in this as in other forces, the
inverse square. Coulomb has the merit of having first clearly
confirmed this law, by the use of his torsion-balance.<a
id="fnanchor13-12" href="#note13-12"><span
class="fnanchor">13</span></a> He established, at the same time, other
very important facts, for instance, “that the directive magnetic
force, which the earth exerts upon a needle, is a constant quantity,
parallel <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page222">222</a></span> to the
magnetic meridian, and passing through the same point of the needle
whatever be its position.” This was the more important, because it was
necessary, in the first place, to allow for the effect of the
terrestrial force, before the mutual action of the magnets could be
extricated from the phenomena.<a id="fnanchor14-12"
href="#note14-12"><span class="fnanchor">14</span></a> Coulomb then
proceeded to correct the theory of magnetism.</p>

<p>Coulomb’s reform of the Æpinian theory, in the case of magnetism,
as in that of electricity, substituted two fluids (an <i>austral</i>
and a <i>boreal</i> fluid,) for the single fluid; and in this way
removed the necessity under which Æpinus found himself, of supposing
all the particles of iron and steel and other magnetic bodies to have
a peculiar repulsion for each other, exactly equal to their attraction
for the magnetic fluid. But in the case of magnetism, another
modification was necessary. It was impossible to suppose here, as in
the electrical phenomena, that one of the fluids was accumulated on
one extremity of a body, and the other fluid on the other extremity;
for though this might appear, at first sight, to be the case in a
magnetic needle, it was found that when the needle was cut into two
halves, the half in which the austral fluid had seemed to predominate,
acquired immediately a boreal pole opposite to its austral pole, and a
similar effect followed in the other half. The same is true, into
however many parts the magnetic body be cut. The way in which Coulomb
modified the theory so as to reconcile it with such facts, is simple
and satisfactory. He supposes<a id="fnanchor15-12"
href="#note15-12"><span class="fnanchor">15</span></a> the magnetic
body to be made up of “molecules or integral parts,” or, as they were
afterwards called by M. Poisson, “magnetic elements.” In each of these
elements, (which are extremely minute,) the fluids can be separated,
so that each element has an austral and a boreal pole; but the austral
pole of an element which is adjacent to the boreal pole of the next,
neutralizes, or nearly neutralizes, its effect; so that the sensible
magnetism appears only towards the extremities of the body, as it
would do if the fluids could permeate the body freely. We shall have
exactly the same result, as to sensible magnetic force, on the one
supposition and on the other, as Coulomb showed.<a id="fnanchor16-12"

<p>The theory, thus freed from manifest incongruities, was to be
reduced to calculation, and compared with experiment; this was done in
Coulomb’s Seventh Memoir.<a id="fnanchor17-12" href="#note17-12"><span

this, as in the electric problem, could not be entirely surmounted by

theoretically the <span class="pagenum"><a

points of a needle,<a id="fnanchor18-12" href="#note18-12"><span
class="fnanchor">18</span></a> and the proposition that the directive
force of the earth on similar needles saturated with magnetism, was as
the cube of their dimensions; conclusions which agreed with
experiment.</p>

<p>The agreement thus obtained was sufficient to give a great
probability to the theory; but an improvement of the methods of
calculation and a repetition of experiments, was, in this as in other
cases, desirable, as a confirmation of the labors of the original
theorist. These requisites, in the course of time, were supplied. The
researches of Laplace and Legendre on the figure of the earth had (as
we have already <a href="#v1page377">stated</a>,) introduced some very
peculiar analytical artifices, applicable to the attractions of
spheroids; and these methods were employed by M. Biot in 1811, to show
that on an elliptical spheroid, the thickness of the fluid in the
direction of the radius would be as the distance from the centre.<a
id="fnanchor19-12" href="#note19-12"><span
class="fnanchor">19</span></a> But the subject was taken up in a more
complete manner in 1824 by M. Poisson, who obtained general
expressions for the attractions or repulsions of a body of any form
whatever, magnetized by influence, upon a given point; and in the case
of spherical bodies was able completely to solve the equations which
determine these forces.<a id="fnanchor20-12" href="#note20-12"><span

<p>Previously to these theoretical investigations, Mr. Barlow had made
a series of experiments on the effect of an iron sphere upon a compass
needle; and had obtained empirical formulæ for the amount of the
deviation of the needle, according to its dependence upon the position
and magnitude of the sphere. He afterwards deduced the same formulæ
from a theory which was, in fact, identical with that of Coulomb, but
which he considered as different, in that it supposed the magnetic
fluids to be entirely collected at the surface of the sphere. He had
indeed found, by experiment, that the surface was the only part in
which there was any sensible magnetism; and that a thin shell of iron
would produce the same effect as a solid ball of the same
diameter.</p>
<p>But this was, in fact, a most complete verification of Coulomb’s
theory. For though that theory did not suppose the magnetism to be
collected solely at the surface, as Mr. Barlow found it, it followed
from the theory, that the <em>sensible</em> magnetic intensity assumed
the same distribution (namely, a surface distribution,) as if the
fluids could permeate the whole body, instead of the “magnetic
elements” only. Coulomb, indeed, had not expressly noticed the result,
that the sensible <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page224">224</a></span> magnetism would be confined to the
surface of bodies; but he had found that, in a long needle, the
magnetic fluid might be supposed to be concentrated very near the
extremities, just as it is in a long electric body. The theoretical
confirmation of this rule among the other consequences of the
theory,&#8212;that the sensible magnetism would be collected at the
surface,&#8212;was one of the results of Poisson’s analysis. For it
appeared that if the sum of the electric elements of the body was
equal to the whole body, there would be no difference between the
action of a solid sphere and very thin shell.</p>
<p>We may, then, consider the Coulombian theory to be fully
established and verified, as a representation of the laws of
magnetical phenomena. We may add, as a remarkable and valuable example
of an ulterior step in the course of sciences, the application of the
laws of the distribution of magnetism to the purposes of navigation.
It had been found that the mass of iron which exists in a ship
produces a deviation in the direction of the compass-needle, which was
termed “local attraction,” and which rendered the compass an erroneous
guide. Mr. Barlow proposed to correct this by a plate of iron placed
near the compass; the plate being of comparatively small mass, but, in
consequence of its expanded form, and its proximity to the needle, of
equivalent effect to the disturbing cause.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [This proposed arrangement was not successful, because as
the ship turns into different positions, it may be considered as
revolving round a vertical axis; and as this does not coincide with
the magnetic axis, the relative magnetic position of the disturbing
parts of the ship, and of the correcting plate, will be altered, so
that they will not continue to counteract each other. In high magnetic
latitudes the correcting plate was used with success.</p>
<p>But when iron ships became common, a correction of the effect of
the iron upon the ship’s compass in the general case became necessary.
Mr. Airy devised the means of making this correction. By placing a
magnet and a mass of iron in certain positions relative to the
compass, the effect of the rest of the iron in the ship is completely
counteracted in all positions.<a id="fnanchor21-12"

<p>But we have still to trace the progress of the theory of
terrestrial magnetism.</p>
<p id="terrestrial"><i>Theory of Terrestrial
Magnetism.</i>&#8212;Gilbert had begun a plausible course of
speculation on this point. “We must reject,” he says,<a
id="fnanchor22-12" href="#note22-12"><span
class="fnanchor">22</span></a> “in <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page225">225</a></span> the first place, that vulgar opinion of
recent writers concerning magnetic mountains, or a certain magnetic
rock, or an imaginary pole at a certain distance from the pole of the
earth.” For, he adds, “we learn by experience, that there is no such
fixed pole or term in the earth for the variation.” Gilbert describes
the whole earth as a magnetic globe, and attributes the variation to
the irregular form of its protuberances, the solid parts only being
magnetic. It was not easy to confirm or refute this opinion, but other
hypotheses were tried by various writers; for instance, Halley had
imagined, from the forms of the lines of equal variation, that there
must be four magnetic poles; but Euler<a id="fnanchor23-12"
href="#note23-12"><span class="fnanchor">23</span></a> showed that the
“Halleian lines” would, for the most part, result from the supposition
of two magnetic poles, and assigned their position so as to represent
pretty well the known state of the variation all over the world in
1744. But the variation was not the only phenomenon which required to
be taken into account; the dip at different places, and also the
intensity of the force, were to be considered. We have <a
href="#v2page219">already</a> mentioned M. de Humboldt’s collection of
observations of the dip. These were examined by M. Biot, with the view
of reducing them to the action of two poles in the supposed
terrestrial magnetic axis. Having, at first, made the distance of
these poles from the centre of the earth indefinite, he found that his
formulæ agreed more and more nearly with the observations, as the
poles were brought nearer; and that fact and theory coincided
tolerably well when both poles were at the centre. In 1809,<a
id="fnanchor24-12" href="#note24-12"><span
class="fnanchor">24</span></a> Krafft simplified this result, by
showing that, on this supposition, the tangent of the dip was twice
the tangent of the latitude of the place as measured from the magnetic
equator. But M. Hansteen, who has devoted to the subject of
terrestrial magnetism a great amount of labor and skill, has shown
that, taking together all the observations which we possess, we are
compelled to suppose four magnetic poles; two near the north pole, and
two near the south pole, of the terrestrial globe; and that these
poles, no two of which are exactly opposite each other, are all in
motion, with different velocities, some moving to the east and some to
the west. This curious collection of facts awaits the hand of future
theorists, when the ripeness of time shall invite them to the
task.</p>

<p>[2nd Ed.] [I had thus written in the first edition. The theorist
who was needed to reduce this accumulation of facts to their laws,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page226">226</a></span> had already
laid his powerful hand upon them; namely, M. Gauss, a mathematician
not inferior to any of the great men who completed the theory of
gravitation. And institutions had been established for extending the
collection of the facts pertaining to it, on a scale which elevates
Magnetism into a companionship with Astronomy. M. Hansteen’s
<i>Magnetismus der Erde</i> was published in 1819. His conclusions
respecting the position of the four magnetic “poles” excited so much
interest in his own country, that the Norwegian <i>Storthing</i>, or
parliament, by a unanimous vote, provided funds for a magnetic
expedition which he was to conduct along the north of Europe and Asia;
and this they did at the very time when they refused to make a grant
to the king for building a palace at Christiania. The expedition was
made in 1828&#8211;30, and verified Hansteen’s anticipations as to the
existence of a region of magnetic convergence in Siberia, which he
considered as indicating a “pole” to the north of that country. M.
Erman also travelled round the earth at the same time, making magnetic
observations.</p>
<p>About the same time another magnetical phenomenon attracted
attention. Besides the general motion of the magnetic poles, and the
diurnal movements of the needle, it was found that small and irregular
disturbances take place in its position, which M. de Humboldt termed
<i>magnetic storms</i>. And that which excited a strong interest on
this subject was the discovery that these magnetic storms, seen only
by philosophers who watch the needle with microscopic exactness, rage
simultaneously over large tracts of the surface of our globe. This was
detected about 1825 by a comparison of the observations of M. Arago at
Paris with simultaneous observations of M. Kupffer at Kasan in Russia,
distant more than 47 degrees of longitude.</p>
<p>At the instance of M. de Humboldt, the Imperial Academy of Russia
adopted with zeal the prosecution of this inquiry, and formed a chain
of magnetic stations across the whole of the Russian empire. Magnetic
observations were established at Petersburg and at Kasan, and
corresponding observations were made at Moscow, at Nicolaieff in the
Crimea, and Barnaoul and Nertchinsk in Siberia, at Sitka in Russian
America, and even at Pekin. To these magnetic stations the Russian
government afterwards added, Catharineburg in Russia Proper,
Helsingfors in Finland, Teflis in Georgia. A comparison of the results
obtained at four of these stations made by MM. de Humboldt and Dove,
in the year 1830, showed that the magnetic disturbances were
simultaneous, and were for the most parallel in their progress. <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page227">227</a></span></p>
<p>Important steps in the prosecution of this subject were soon after
made by M. Gauss, the great mathematician of Göttingen. He contrived
instruments and modes of observation far more perfect than any before
employed, and organized a system of comparative observations
throughout Europe. In 1835, stations for this purpose were established
at Altona, Augsburg, Berlin, Breda, Breslau, Copenhagen, Dublin,
Freiberg, Göttingen, Greenwich, Hanover, Leipsic, Marburg, Milan,
Munich, Petersburg, Stockholm, and Upsala. At these places, six times
in the year, observations were taken simultaneously, at intervals of
five minutes for 24 hours. The <i>Results of the Magnetic
Association</i> (Resultaten des Magnetischen Vereins) were published
by MM. Gauss and Weber, beginning in 1836.</p>
<p>British physicists did not at first take any leading part in these
plans. But in 1836, Baron Humboldt, who by his long labors and
important discoveries in this subject might be considered as
peculiarly entitled to urge its claims, addressed a letter to the Duke
of Sussex, then President of the Royal Society, asking for the
co-operation of this country in so large and hopeful a scheme for the
promotion of science. The Royal Society willingly entertained this
appeal; and the progress of the cause was still further promoted when
it was zealously taken up by the British Association for the
Advancement of Science, assembled at Newcastle in 1838. The
Association there expressed its strong interest in the German system
of magnetic observations; and at the instigation of this body, and of
the Royal Society, four complete magnetical observatories were
established by the British government, at Toronto, St. Helena, the
Cape of Good Hope, and Van Diemen’s Land. The munificence of the
Directors of the East India Company founded and furnished an equal
number at Simla (in the Himalayah), Madras, Bombay, and Sincapore. Sir
Thomas Brisbane added another at his own expense at Kelso, in
Scotland. Besides this, the government sent out a naval expedition to
make discoveries (magnetic among others), in the Antarctic regions,
under the command of Sir James Ross. Other states lent their
assistance also, and founded or reorganized their magnetic
observatories. Besides those already mentioned, one was established by
the French government at Algiers; one by the Belgian, at Brussels; two
by Austria, at Prague and Milan; one by Prussia, at Breslau; one by
Bavaria, at Munich; one by Spain, at Cadiz; there are two in the
United States, at Philadelphia and Cambridge; one at Cairo, founded by
the Pasha of Egypt; and in India, one at Trevandrum, established by
the Rajah of Travancore; and one by <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page228">228</a></span> the King of Oude, at Lucknow. At all
these distant stations the same plan was followed out, by observations
strictly simultaneous, made according to the same methods, with the
same instrumental means. Such a scheme, combining world-wide extent
with the singleness of action of an individual mind, is hitherto
without parallel.</p>
<p>At first, the British stations were established for three years
only; but it was thought advisable to extend this period three years
longer, to end in 1845. And when the termination of that period
arrived, a discussion was held among the magneticians themselves,
whether it was better to continue the observations still, or to
examine and compare the vast mass of observations already collected,
so as to see to what results and improvements of methods they pointed.
This question was argued at the meeting of the British Association at
Cambridge in that year; and the conference ended in the magneticians
requesting to have the observations continued, at some of the
observatories for an indefinite period, at others, till the year 1848.
In the mean time the Antarctic expedition had brought back a rich
store of observations, fitted to disclose the magnetic condition of
those regions which it had explored. These were <em>discussed</em>,
and their results exhibited, in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>
for 1843, by Col. Sabine, who had himself at various periods, made
magnetic observations in the Arctic regions, and in several remote
parts of the globe, and had always been a zealous laborer in this
fruitful field. The general mass of the observations was placed under
the management of Professor Lloyd, of Dublin, who has enriched the
science of magnetism with several valuable instruments and methods,
and who, along with Col. Sabine, made a magnetic survey of the British
Isles in 1835 and 1836.</p>
<p>I do not dwell upon magnetic surveys of various countries made by
many excellent observers; as MM. Quetelet, Forbes, Fox, Bache and
others.</p>
<p>The facts observed at each station were, the <i>intensity</i> of
the magnetic force; the <i>declination</i> of the needle from the
meridian, sometimes called the <i>variation</i>; and its
<i>inclination</i> to the horizon, <i>the dip</i>;&#8212;or at least,
some elements equivalent to these. The values of these elements at any
given time, if known, can be expressed by charts of the earth’s
surface, on which are drawn the <i>isodynamic</i>, <i>isogonal</i>,
and <i>isoclinal</i> curves. The second of these kinds of charts
contain the “Halleian lines” spoken of in a previous <a
href="#v2page225">page</a>. Moreover the magnetic elements at each
place are to be observed in such a <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page229">229</a></span> manner as to determine both their
<i>periodical</i> variations (the changes which occur in the period of
a day, and of a year), the <i>secular</i> changes, as the gradual
increase or diminution of the declination at the same place for many
years; and the <i>irregular</i> fluctuations which, as we have said, are
simultaneous over a large part, or the whole, of the earth’s
surface.</p>
<p>When these Facts have been ascertained over the whole extent of the
earth’s surface, we shall still have to inquire what is the Cause of
the changes in the forces which these phenomena disclose. But as a
basis for all speculation on that subject, we must know the law of the
phenomena, and of the forces which immediately produce them. I have
already <a href="#v2page225">said</a> that Euler tried to account for
the Halleian lines by means of <em>two</em> magnetic “poles,” but that
M. Hansteen conceived it necessary to assume <em>four</em>. But an
entirely new light has been thrown upon this subject by the beautiful
investigations of Gauss, in his <i>Theory of Terrestrial
Magnetism</i>, published in 1839. He remarks that the term “poles,” as
used by his predecessors, involves an assumption arbitrary, and, as it
is now found, false; namely, that certain definite points, two, four,
or more, acting according to the laws of ordinary magnetical poles,
will explain the phenomena. He starts from a more comprehensive
assumption, that magnetism is distributed throughout the mass of the
earth in an unknown manner. On this assumption he obtains a function
<i>V</i>, by the differentials of which the elements of the magnetic
force at any point will be expressed. This function <i>V</i> is well
known in physical astronomy, and is obtained by summing all the
elements of magnetic force in each particle, each multiplied by the
reciprocal of its distance; or as we may express it, by taking the sum
of each element and its proximity jointly. Hence it has been
proposed<a id="fnanchor25-12" href="#note25-12"><span
class="fnanchor">25</span></a> to term this function the “<i>integral
proximity</i>” of the attracting mass.<a id="fnanchor26-12"
href="#note26-12"><span class="fnanchor">26</span></a> By using the
most refined <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page230">230</a></span>
mathematical artifices for deducing the values of <i>V</i> and its
differentials in converging series, he is able to derive the
coefficients of these series from the observed magnetic elements at
certain places, and hence, to calculate them for all places. The
comparison of the calculation with the observed results is, of course,
the test of the truth of the theory.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note25-12"

283.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note26-12"
href="#fnanchor26-12">26</a></span> The function V is of constant
occurrence in investigations respecting attractions. It is introduced
by Laplace in his investigations respecting the attractions of
spheroids, <i>Méc. Cél.</i> Livr. <span class="sc">iii</span>. Art. 4.
Mr. Green and Professor Mac Cullagh have proposed to term this
function the <i>Potential</i> of the system; but this term (though
suggested, I suppose, by analogy with the substantive
<i>Exponential</i>), does not appear convenient in its form. On the
other hand, the term <i>Integral Proximity</i> does not indicate that
which gives the function its peculiar claim to distinction; namely,
that its differentials express the power or attraction of the system.
Perhaps <i>Integral Potentiality</i>, or <i>Integral Attractivity</i>,
would be a term combining the recommendations of both the
others.</div>
<p>The degree of convergence of the series depends upon the unknown
distribution of magnetism within the earth. “If we could venture to
assume,” says M. Gauss, “that the members have a sensible influence
only as far as the fourth order, complete observations from eight
points would be sufficient, theoretically considered, for the
determination of the coefficients.” And under certain limitations,
making this assumption, as the best we can do at present, M. Gauss
obtains from eight places, 24 coefficients (each supplying three
elements), and hence calculates the magnetic elements (intensity,
variation and dip) at 91 places in all parts of the earth. He finds
his calculations approach the observed values with a degree of
exactness which appears to be quite convincing as to the general truth
of his results; especially taking into account how entirely unlimited
is his original hypothesis.</p>
<p>It is one of the most curious results of this investigation that
according to the most simple meaning which we can give to the term
“pole” the earth has only <em>two</em> magnetic poles; that is, two
points where the direction of the magnetic force is vertical. And thus
the <i>isogonal curves</i> may be looked upon as <em>deformations</em>
of the curves deduced by Euler from the supposition of two poles, the
deformation arising from this, that the earth does not contain a
single definite magnet, but irregularly diffused magnetical elements,
which still have collectively a distinct resemblance to a single
magnet. And instead of Hansteen’s Siberian pole, we have a Siberian
region in which the needles converge; but if the apparent convergence
be pursued it nowhere comes to a point; and the like is the case in
the Antarctic region. When the 24 Gaussian elements at any time are
known the magnetic condition of the globe is known, just as the
mechanical condition of the solar system is known, when we know the
elements of the orbits of the satellites and planets and the mass of
each. And the comparison of this magnetic condition of the globe at
distant periods of time cannot fail to supply materials for future
researches and speculations with regard to the agencies by which the
condition of the earth is determined. The condition of which we here
speak must necessarily be its <i>mechanico-chemical</i> condition,
being expressed, as it will be, in terms of the mechanico-chemical
sciences. The <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page231">231</a></span>
investigations I have been describing belong to the mechanical side of
the subject: but when philosophers have to consider the causes of the
secular changes which are found to occur in this mechanical condition,
they cannot fail to be driven to electrical, that is, chemical
agencies and laws.</p>
<p>I can only allude to Gauss’s investigations respecting the
<i>Absolute Measure</i> of the Earth’s Magnetic Force. To determine
the ratio of the magnetic force of the earth to that of a known
magnet, Poisson proposed to observe the time of vibration of a second
magnet. The method of Gauss, now universally adopted, consists in
observing the position of equilibrium of the second magnet when
deflected by the first.</p>
<p>The manner in which the business of magnetic observation has been
taken up by the governments of our time makes this by far the greatest
scientific undertaking which the world has ever seen. The result will
be that we shall obtain in a few years a knowledge of the magnetic
constitution of the earth which otherwise it might have required
centuries to accumulate. The secular magnetic changes must still
require a long time to reduce to their laws of phenomena, except
observation be anticipated or assisted by some happy discovery as to
the cause of these changes. But besides the special gain to magnetic
science by this great plan of joint action among the nations of the
earth, there is thereby a beginning made in the recognition and
execution of the duty of forwarding science in general by national
exertions. For at most of the magnetic observatories, meteorological
observations are also carried on; and such observations, being far
more extensive, systematic, and permanent than those which have
usually been made, can hardly fail to produce important additions to
science. But at any rate they do for science that which nations can
do, and individuals cannot; and they seek for scientific truths in a
manner suitable to the respect now professed for science and to the
progress which its methods have made. Nor are we to overlook the
effect of such observations as means of training men in the pursuit of
science. “There is amongst us,” says one of the magnetic observers, “a
growing recognition of the importance, both for science and for
practical life, of forming exact observers of nature. Hitherto
astronomy alone has afforded a very partial opportunity for the
formation of fine observers, of which few could avail themselves.
Experience has shown that magnetic observations may serve as excellent
training schools in this respect.”<a id="fnanchor27-12"

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page232">232</a></span> The various
other circumstances which terrestrial magnetism exhibits,&#8212;the
diurnal and annual changes of the position of the
compass-needle;&#8212;the larger secular change which affects it in
the course of years;&#8212;the difference of intensity at different
places, and other facts, have naturally occupied philosophers with the
attempt to determine, both the laws of the phenomena and their causes.
But these attempts necessarily depend, not upon laws of statical
magnetism, such as they have been explained above; but upon the laws
by which the production and intensity of magnetism in different cases
are regulated;&#8212;laws which belong to a different province, and
are related to a different set of principles. Thus, for example, we
have not attempted to explain the discovery of the laws by which heat
influences magnetism; and therefore we cannot now give an account of
those theories of the facts relating to terrestrial magnetism, which
depend upon the influence of temperature. The conditions of excitation
of magnetism are best studied by comparing this force with other cases
where the same effects are produced by very different apparent
agencies; such as galvanic and thermo-electricity. To the history of
these we shall presently proceed.</p>
<p><i>Conclusion.</i>&#8212;The hypothesis of magnetic fluids, as
physical realities, was never widely or strongly embraced, as that of
electric fluids was. For though the hypothesis accounted, to a
remarkable degree of exactness, for large classes of the phenomena,
the presence of a material fluid was not indicated by facts of a
different kind, such as the spark, the discharge from points, the
shock, and its mechanical effects. Thus the belief of a peculiar
magnetic fluid or fluids was not forced upon men’s minds; and the
doctrine above stated was probably entertained by most of its
adherents, chiefly as a means of expressing the laws of phenomena in
their elementary form.</p>
<p>One other observation occurs here. We have seen that the
supposition of a fluid moveable from one part of bodies to another,
and capable of accumulation in different parts of the surface,
appeared at first to be as distinctly authorized by magnetic as by
electric phenomena; and yet that it afterwards appeared, by
calculation, that this must be considered as a derivative result; no
real transfer of fluid taking place except within the limits of the
insensible particles of the body. Without attempting to found a
formula of philosophizing on this circumstance, we may observe, that
this occurrence, like the disproof of heat as a material fluid, shows
the possibility of an hypothesis which shall very exactly satisfy many
phenomena, and yet be incomplete: it <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page233">233</a></span> shows, too, the necessity of bringing
facts of all kinds to bear on the hypothesis; thus, in this case it
was requisite to take into account the facts of junction and
separation of magnetic bodies, as well as their attractions and
repulsions.</p>
<p>If we have seen reason to doubt the doctrine of electric fluids as
physical realities, we cannot help pronouncing upon the magnetic
fluids as having still more insecure claims to a material existence,
even on the grounds just stated. But we may add considerations still
more decisive; for at a further stage of discovery, as we shall see,
magnetic and electric action were found to be connected in the closest
manner, so as to lead to the persuasion of their being different
effects of one common cause. After those discoveries, no philosopher
would dream of assuming electric fluids and magnetic fluids as two
distinct material agents. Yet even now the nature of the dependence of
magnetism upon any other cause is extremely difficult to conceive. But
till we have noticed some of the discoveries to which we have alluded,
we cannot even speculate about that dependence. We now, therefore,
proceed to sketch the history of these discoveries. ~Additional

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Discovery of Voltaic Electricity.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">WE</span> have given the name of
<i>mechanico-chemical</i> to the class of sciences now under our
consideration; for these sciences are concerned with cases in which
mechanical effects, that is, attractions and repulsions, are produced;
while the conditions under which these effects occur, depend, as we
shall hereafter see, on chemical relations. In that branch of these
sciences which we have just treated of, Magnetism, the mechanical
phenomena were obvious, but their connexion with chemical causes was
by no means apparent, and, indeed, has not yet come under our
notice.</p>
<p>The subject to which we now proceed, Galvanism, belongs to the same
group, but, at first sight, exhibits only the other, the chemical,
portion of the features of the class; for the connexion of galvanic
phenomena with chemical action was soon made out, but the mechanical
effects which accompany them were not examined till the examination
was required by a new train of discovery. It is to be observed, that I
do not include in the class of mechanical effects the convulsive
motions in the limbs of animals which are occasioned by galvanic
action; for these movements are produced, not by attraction and
repulsion, but by muscular irritability; and though they indicate the
existence of a peculiar agency, cannot be used to measure its
intensity and law.</p>
<p>The various examples of the class of agents which we here
consider,&#8212;magnetism, electricity, galvanism, electro-magnetism,
thermo-electricity,&#8212;differ from each other principally in the
circumstances by which they are called into action; and these
differences are in reality of a chemical nature, and will have to be
considered when we come to treat of the inductive steps by which the
general principles of chemical theory are established. In the present
part of our task, therefore, we must take for granted the chemical
conditions on which the excitation of these various kinds of action
depends, and trace the history of the discovery of their mechanical
laws only. This rule will much abridge the account we have here to
give of the progress of discovery in the provinces to which I have
just referred. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page238">238</a></span></p>
<p>The first step in this career of discovery was that made by
Galvani, Professor of Anatomy at Bologna. In 1790, electricity, as an
experimental science, was nearly stationary. The impulse given to its
progress by the splendid phenomena of the Leyden phial had almost died
away; Coulomb was employed in systematizing the theory of the electric
fluid, as shown by its statical effects; but in all the other parts of
the subject, no great principle or new result had for some time been
detected. The first announcement of Galvani’s discovery in 1791
excited great notice, for it was given forth as a manifestation of
electricity under a new and remarkable character; namely, as residing
in the muscles of animals.<a id="fnanchor1-13" href="#note1-13"><span
class="fnanchor">1</span></a> The limbs of a dissected frog were
observed to move, when touched with pieces of two different metals;
the agent which produced these motions was conceived to be identified
with electricity, and was termed <i>animal electricity</i>; and
Galvani’s experiments were repeated, with various modifications, in
all parts of Europe, exciting much curiosity, and giving rise to many
speculations.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-13"
href="#fnanchor1-13">1</a></span> <i>De Viribus Electricis in Motu
Musculari</i>, Comm. Bonon. t. vii. 1792.</div>
<p>It is our business to determine the character of each great
discovery which appears in the progress of science. Men are fond of
repeating that such discoveries are most commonly the result of
accident; and we have seen reason to reject this opinion, since that
preparation of thought by which the accident produces discovery is the
most important of the conditions on which the successful event
depends. Such accidents are like a spark which discharges a gun
already loaded and pointed. In the case of Galvani, indeed, the
discovery may, with more propriety than usual, be said to have been
casual; but in the form in which it was first noted, it exhibited no
important novelty. His frog was lying on a table near the conductor of
an electrical machine, and the convulsions appeared only when a spark
was taken from the machine. If Galvani had been as good a physicist as
he was an anatomist, he would probably have seen that the movements so
occasioned proved only that the muscles or nerves, or the two
together, formed a very sensitive indicator of electrical action. It
was when he produced such motions by contact of metals alone, that he
obtained an important and fundamental fact in science.</p>
<p>The analysis of this fact into its real and essential conditions
was the work of Alexander Volta, another Italian professor. Volta,
indeed, possessed that knowledge of the subject of electricity which
made a hint like that of Galvani the basis of a new science. Galvani
appears <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page239">239</a></span> never
to have acquired much general knowledge of electricity: Volta, on the
other hand, had labored at this branch of knowledge from the age of
eighteen, through a period of nearly thirty years; and had invented an
<i>electrophorus</i> and an <i>electrical condenser</i>, which showed
great experimental skill. When he turned his attention to the
experiments made by Galvani, he observed that the author of them had
been far more surprised than he needed to be, at those results in
which an electrical spark was produced; and that it was only in the
cases in which no such apparatus was employed, that the observations
could justly be considered as indicating a new law, or a new kind of
electricity.<a id="fnanchor2-13" href="#note2-13"><span
class="fnanchor">2</span></a> He soon satisfied himself<a
id="fnanchor3-13" href="#note3-13"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a>
(about 1794) that the essential conditions of this kind of action
depended on the metals; that it is brought into play most decidedly
when two different metals touch each other, and are connected by any
moist body;&#8212;and that the parts of animals which had been used
discharged the office both of such moist bodies, and of very sensitive
electrometers. The <em>animal</em> electricity of Galvani might, he
observed, be with more propriety called <em>metallic</em>
electricity.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note2-13"
href="#fnanchor2-13">2</a></span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1793, p.
21.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note3-13"
href="#fnanchor3-13">3</a></span> See Fischer, viii. 625.</div>
<p>The recognition of this agency as a peculiar kind of
<i>electricity</i>, arose in part perhaps, at first, from the
confusion made by Galvani between the cases in which his electrical
machine was, and those in which it was not employed. But the identity
was confirmed by its being found that the known difference of
electrical conductors and non-conductors regulated the conduction of
the new influence. The more exact determination of the new facts to
those of electricity was a succeeding step of the progress of the
subject.</p>
<p>The term “animal electricity” has been superseded by others, of
which <i>galvanism</i> is perhaps the most familiar. I think it will
appear from what has been said, that Volta’s office in this discovery
is of a much higher and more philosophical kind than that of Galvani;
and it would, on this account, be more fitting to employ the term
<i>voltaic electricity</i>; which, indeed, is very commonly used,
especially by our most recent and comprehensive writers.</p>
<p>Volta more fully still established his claim as the main originator
of this science by his next step. When some of those who repeated the
experiments of Galvani had expressed a wish that there was some method
of multiplying the effect of <em>this</em> electricity, such as the
Leyden phial supplies for common electricity, they probably thought
their wishes far from a realization. But the <i>voltaic pile</i>,
which Volta <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page240">240</a></span>
described in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> for 1800,
completely satisfies this aspiration; and was, in fact, a more
important step in the history of electricity than the Leyden jar had
been. It has since undergone various modifications, of which the most
important was that introduced by <span class="correction"
title="emended from Cruikshanks">Cruickshank</span>s, who<a
id="fnanchor4-13" href="#note4-13"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a>
substituted a trough for a pile. But in all cases the principle of the
instrument was the same;&#8212;a continued repetition of the triple
combination of two metals and a fluid in contact, so as to form a
circuit which returns into itself.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note4-13"
href="#fnanchor4-13">4</a></span> Fischer, viii. p. 683.</div>
<p>Such an instrument is capable of causing effects of great
intensity; as seen both in the production of light and heat, and in
chemical changes. But the discovery with which we are here concerned,
is not the details and consequences of the effects, (which belong to
chemistry,) but the analysis of the conditions under which such
effects take place; and this we may consider as completed by Volta at
the epoch of which we speak.</p>
<hr class="three space-above" />
<h3>CHAPTER II.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Reception and Confirmation of the Discovery of
Voltaic Electricity.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">GALVANI’S</span> experiments excited
a great interest all over Europe, in consequence partly of a
circumstance which, as we have seen, was unessential, the muscular
contractions and various sensations which they occasioned. Galvani
himself had not only considered the animal element of the circuit as
the origin of the electricity, but had framed a theory,<a
id="fnanchor5-13" href="#note5-13"><span class="fnanchor">5</span></a>
in which he compared the muscles to charged jars, and the nerves to
the discharging wires; and a controversy was, for some time, carried
on, in Italy, between the adherents of Galvani and those of Volta.<a
id="fnanchor6-13" href="#note6-13"><span
class="fnanchor">6</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note5-13"

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note6-13"
href="#fnanchor6-13">6</a></span> Ib. viii. 619.</div>
<p>The galvanic experiments, and especially those which appeared to
have a physiological bearing, were verified and extended by a number
of the most active philosophers of Europe, and especially William von
Humboldt. A commission of the Institute of France, appointed in 1797,
repeated many of the known experiments, but does not seem to have
decided any disputed points. The researches of this <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page241">241</a></span> commission referred
rather to the discoveries of Galvani than to those of Volta: the
latter were, indeed, hardly known in France till the conquest of Italy
by Bonaparte, in 1801. France was, at the period of these discoveries,
separated from all other countries by war, and especially from
England,<a id="fnanchor7-13" href="#note7-13"><span
class="fnanchor">7</span></a> where Volta’s Memoirs were
published.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note7-13"
href="#fnanchor7-13">7</a></span> <i>Biog. Univ.</i>, art.
<i>Volta</i>, (by Biot.)</div>
<p>The political revolutions of Italy affected, in very different
manners, the two discoverers of whom we speak. Galvani refused to take
an oath of allegiance to the Cisalpine republic, which the French
conqueror established; he was consequently stripped of all his
offices; and deprived, by the calamities of the times, of most of his
relations, he sank into poverty, melancholy, and debility. At last his
scientific reputation induced the republican rulers to decree his
restoration to his professorial chair; but his claims were recognised
too late, and he died without profiting by this intended favor, in
1798.</p>
<p>Volta, on the other hand, was called to Paris by Bonaparte as a man
of science, and invested with honors, emoluments, and titles. The
conqueror himself, indeed, was strongly interested by this train of
research.<a id="fnanchor8-13" href="#note8-13"><span
class="fnanchor">8</span></a> He himself founded valuable prizes,
expressly with a view to promote its prosecution. At this period,
there was something in this subject peculiarly attractive to his
Italian mind; for the first glimpses of discoveries of great promise
have always excited an enthusiastic activity of speculation in the
philosophers of Italy, though generally accompanied with a want of
precise thought. It is narrated<a id="fnanchor9-13"
href="#note9-13"><span class="fnanchor">9</span></a> of Bonaparte,
that after seeing the decomposition of the salts by means of the
voltaic pile, he turned to Corvisart, his physician, and said, “Here,
doctor, is the image of life; the vertebral column is the pile, the
liver is the negative, the bladder the positive, pole.” The importance
of voltaic researches is not less than it was estimated by Bonaparte;
but the results to which it was to lead were of a kind altogether
different from those which thus suggested themselves to his mind. The
connexion of mechanical and chemical action was the first great point
to be dealt with; and for this purpose the laws of the mechanical
action of voltaic electricity were to be studied.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note8-13"
href="#fnanchor8-13">8</a></span> Becquerel, <i>Traité d’Electr.</i>
t. i. p. 107.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note9-13"
href="#fnanchor9-13">9</a></span> Ib. t. i. p. 108.</div>
<p>It will readily be supposed that the voltaic researches, thus
begun, opened a number of interesting topics of examination and
discussion. These, however, it does not belong to our place to dwell
upon at present; since they formed parts of the theory of the subject,
which <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page242">242</a></span> was not
completed till light had been thrown upon it from other quarters. The
identity of galvanism with electricity, for instance, was at first, as
we have intimated, rather conjectured than proved. It was denied by
Dr. Fowler, in 1793; was supposed to be confirmed by Dr. Wells two
years later; but was, still later, questioned by Davy. The nature of
the operation of the pile was variously conceived. Volta himself had
obtained a view of it which succeeding researches confirmed, when he
asserted,<a id="fnanchor10-13" href="#note10-13"><span
class="fnanchor">10</span></a> in 1800, that it resembled an electric
battery feebly charged and constantly renewing its charge. In
pursuance of this view, the common electrical action was, at a later
period (for instance by Ampère, in 1820), called <i>electrical
tension</i>, while the voltaic action was called the <i>electrical
current</i>, or <i>electromotive action</i>. The different effects
produced, by increasing the size and the number of the plates in the
voltaic trough, were also very remarkable. The power of producing heat
was found to depend on the size of the plates; the power of producing
chemical changes, on the other hand, was augmented by the number of
plates of which the battery consisted. The former effect was referred
to the increased <em>quantity</em>, the latter to the
<em>intensity</em>, of the electric fluid. We mention these
distinctions at present, rather for the purpose of explaining the
language in which the results of the succeeding investigations are
narrated, than with the intention of representing the hypotheses and
measures which they imply, as clearly established, at the period of
which we speak. For that purpose new discoveries were requisite, which
we have soon to relate.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Discovery of the Laws of the Mutual Attraction and
Repulsion of Voltaic Currents.&#8212;Ampère.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IN</span> order to show the place of
voltaic electricity among the mechanico-chemical sciences, we must
speak of its mechanical laws as separate from the laws of
electro-magnetic action; although, in fact, it was only in consequence
of the forces which conducting voltaic wires exert upon magnets, that
those forces were detected which they exert upon each <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page243">243</a></span> other. This latter
discovery was made by M. Ampère; and the extraordinary rapidity and
sagacity with which he caught the suggestion of such forces, from the
electro-magnetic experiments of M. Oersted, (of which we shall speak
in the next <a href="#b13-4">chapter</a>,) well entitle him to be
considered as a great and independent discoverer. As he truly says,<a
id="fnanchor11-13" href="#note11-13"><span
class="fnanchor">11</span></a> “it by no means followed, that because
a conducting wire exerted a force on a magnet, two conducting wires
must exert a force on each other; for two pieces of soft iron, both of
which affect a magnet, do not affect each other.” But immediately on
the promulgation of Oersted’s experiments, in 1820, Ampère leapt
forwards to a general theory of the facts, of which theory the mutual
attraction and repulsion of conducting voltaic wires was a fundamental
supposition. The supposition was immediately verified by direct trial;
and the laws of this attraction and repulsion were soon determined,
with great experimental ingenuity, and a very remarkable command of
the resources of analysis. But the experimental and analytical
investigation of the mutual action of voltaic or electrical currents,
was so mixed up with the examination of the laws of electro-magnetism,
which had given occasion to the investigation, that we must not treat
the two provinces of research as separate. The mention in this place,
premature as it might appear, of the labors of Ampère, arises
inevitably from his being the author of a beautiful and comprehensive
generalization, which not only included the phenomena exhibited by the
new combinations of Oersted, but also disclosed forces which existed
in arrangements already familiar, although they had never been
detected till the theory pointed out how they were to be looked
for.</p>

<hr class="three space-above" />
<h3 id="b13-4">CHAPTER IV.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Discovery of Electro-magnetic
Action.&#8212;Oersted.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> impulse which the
discovery of galvanism, in 1791, and that of the voltaic pile, in
1800, had given to the study of electricity as a mechanical science,
had nearly died away in 1820. It was in that year that M. Oersted, of
Copenhagen, announced that the conducting <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page244">244</a></span> wire of a voltaic circuit, acts upon a
magnetic needle; and thus recalled into activity that endeavor to
connect magnetism with electricity, which, though apparently on many
accounts so hopeful, had hitherto been attended with no success.
Oersted found that the needle has a tendency to place itself <em>at
right angles</em> to the wire;&#8212;a kind of action altogether
different from any which had been suspected.</p>
<p>This observation was of vast importance; and the analysis of its
conditions and consequences employed the best philosophers in Europe
immediately on its promulgation. It is impossible, without great
injustice, to refuse great merit to Oersted as the author of the
discovery. We have already said that men appear generally inclined to
believe remarkable discoveries to be accidental, and the discovery of
Oersted has been spoken of as a casual insulated experiment.<a
id="fnanchor12-13" href="#note12-13"><span
class="fnanchor">12</span></a> Yet Oersted had been looking for such
an <em>accident</em> probably more carefully and perseveringly than
any other person in Europe. In 1807, he had published<a
id="fnanchor13-13" href="#note13-13"><span
class="fnanchor">13</span></a> a work, in which he professed that his
purpose was “to ascertain whether electricity, in its most latent
state, had any effect on the magnet.” And he, as I know from his own
declaration, considered his discovery as the natural sequel and
confirmation of his early researches; as, indeed, it fell in readily
and immediately with speculations on these subjects then very
prevalent in Germany. It was an accident like that by which a man
guesses a riddle on which his mind has long been employed.</p>

<p>Besides the confirmation of Oersted’s observations by many
experimenters, great additions were made to his facts: of these, one
of the most important was due to Ampère. Since the earth is in fact
magnetic, the voltaic wire ought to be affected by terrestrial
magnetism alone, and ought to tend to assume a position depending on
the position of the compass-needle. At first, the attempts to produce
this effect failed, but soon, with a more delicate apparatus, the
result was found to agree with the anticipation.</p>
<p>It is impossible here to dwell on any of the subsequent researches,
except so far as they are essential to our great object, the progress
towards a general theory of the subject. I proceed, therefore,
immediately to the attempts made towards this object. <span

<h3 class="space-above">CHAPTER V.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Discovery of the Laws of Electro-magnetic
Action.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">ON</span> attempting to analyse the
electro-magnetic phenomena observed by Oersted and others into their
simplest forms, they appeared, at least at first sight, to be
different from any mechanical actions which had yet been observed. It
seemed as if the conducting wire exerted on the pole of the magnet a
force which was not attractive or repulsive, but
<em>transverse</em>;&#8212;not tending to draw the point acted on
nearer, or to push it further off, in the line which reached from the
acting point, but urging it to move at right angles to this line. The
forces appeared to be such as Kepler had dreamt of in the infancy of
mechanical conceptions; rather than such as those of which Newton had
established the existence in the solar system, and such as he, and all
his successors, had supposed to be the only kinds of force which exist
in nature. The north pole of the needle moved as if it were impelled
by a vortex revolving round the wire in one direction, while the south
pole seemed to be driven by an opposite vortex. The case seemed novel,
and almost paradoxical.</p>
<p>It was soon established by experiments, made in a great variety of
forms, that the mechanical action was really of this transverse kind.
And a curious result was obtained, which a little while before would
have been considered as altogether incredible;&#8212;that this force
would cause a constant and rapid revolution of either of the bodies
about the other;&#8212;of the conducting wire about the magnet, or of
the magnet about the conducting wire. This was effected by Mr. Faraday
in 1821.</p>
<p>The laws which regulated the intensity of this force, with
reference to the distance and position of the bodies, now naturally
came to be examined. MM. Biot and Savart in France, and Mr. Barlow in
England, instituted such measures; and satisfied themselves that the
elementary force followed the law of magnitude of all known elementary
forces, in being inversely as the square of the distance; although, in
its direction, it was so entirely different from other forces. But the
investigation of the <i>laws of phenomena</i> of the subject was too
closely connected with the choice of a mechanical theory, to be
established <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page246">246</a></span>
previously and independently, as had been done in astronomy. The
experiments gave complex results, and the analysis of these into their
elementary actions was almost an indispensable step in order to
disentangle their laws. We must, therefore, state the progress of this
analysis.</p>
<hr class="three space-above" />
<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Theory of Electrodynamical Action.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">AMPÈRE’S Theory.</span>&#8212;Nothing
can show in a more striking manner the advanced condition of physical
speculation in 1820, than the reduction of the strange and complex
phenomena of electromagnetism to a simple and general theory as soon
as they were published. Instead of a gradual establishment of laws of
phenomena, and of theories more and more perfect, occupying ages, as
in the case of astronomy, or generations, as in the instances of
magnetism and electricity, a few months sufficed for the whole process
of generalization; and the experiments made at Copenhagen were
announced at Paris and London, almost at the same time with the
skilful analysis and comprehensive inductions of Ampère.</p>
<p>Yet we should err if we should suppose, from the celerity with
which the task was executed, that it was an easy one. There were
required in the author of such a theory, not only those clear
conceptions of the relations of space and force, which are the first
conditions of all sound theory, and a full possession of the
experiments; but also a masterly command of the mathematical arms by
which alone the victory could be gained, and a sagacious selection of
proper experiments which might decide the fate of the proposed
hypothesis.</p>
<p>It is true, that the nature of the requisite hypothesis was not
difficult to see in a certain vague and limited way. The
conducting-wire and the magnetic needle had a tendency to arrange
themselves at right angles to one another. This might be represented
by supposing the wire to be made up of transverse magnetic needles, or
by supposing the needle to be made up of transverse conducting-wires;
for it was easy to conceive forces which should bring corresponding
elements, either magnetic or voltaic, into parallel positions; and
then the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page247">247</a></span>
general phenomena above stated would be accounted for. And the choice
between the two modes of conception, appeared at first sight a matter
of indifference. The majority of philosophers at first adopted, or at
least employed, the former method, as Oersted in Germany, Berzelius in
Sweden, Wollaston in England.</p>
<p>Ampère adopted the other view, according to which the magnet is
made up of conducting-wires in a transverse position. But he did for
his hypothesis what no one did or could do for the other: he showed
that it was the only one which would account, without additional and
arbitrary suppositions, for the facts of <em>continued</em> motion in
electromagnetic cases. And he further elevated his theory to a higher
rank of generality, by showing that it explained,&#8212;not only the
action of a conducting-wire upon a magnet, but also two other classes
of facts, already spoken of in this history,&#8212;the <a
href="#v2page217">action</a> of magnets upon each other,&#8212;and the
<a href="#v2page243">action</a> of conducting-wires upon each
other.</p>
<p>The deduction of such particular cases from the theory, required,
as may easily be imagined, some complex calculations: but the
deduction being satisfactory, it will be seen that Ampère’s theory
conformed to that description which we have repeatedly had to point
out as the usual character of a true and stable theory; namely, that
besides accounting for the class of phenomena which suggested it, it
supplies an unforeseen explanation of other known facts. For the
mutual action of magnets, which was supposed to be already reduced to
a satisfactory theoretical form by Coulomb, was not contemplated by
Ampère in the formation of his hypothesis; and the mutual action of
voltaic currents, though tried only in consequence of the suggestion
of the theory, was clearly a fact distinct from electromagnetic
action; yet all these facts flowed alike from the theory. And thus
Ampère brought into view a class of forces for which the term
“electromagnetic” was too limited, and which he designated<a
id="fnanchor14-13" href="#note14-13"><span
class="fnanchor">14</span></a> by the appropriate term
<i>electrodynamic</i>; distinguishing them by this expression, as the
forces of an electric <em>current</em>, from the <em>statical</em>
effects of electricity which we had formerly to treat of. This term
has passed into common use among scientific writers, and remains the
record and stamp of the success of the Amperian induction.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note14-13"
href="#fnanchor14-13">14</a></span> <i>Ann. de Chim.</i>, tom. xx. p.
60 (1822).</div>
<p>The first promulgation of Ampère’s views was by a communication to
the French Academy of Sciences, September the 18th, 1820; Oersted’s
discoveries having reached Paris only in the preceding July. <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page248">248</a></span> At almost every
meeting of the Academy during the remainder of that year and the
beginning of the following one, he had new developements or new
confirmations of his theory to announce. The most hypothetical part of
his theory,&#8212;the proposition that magnets might be considered in
their effects as identical with spiral voltaic wires,&#8212;he
asserted from the very first. The mutual attraction and repulsion of
voltaic wires,&#8212;the laws of this action,&#8212;the deduction of
the observed facts from it by calculation,&#8212;the determination, by
new experiments, of the constant quantities which entered into his
formulæ,&#8212;followed in rapid succession. The theory must be
briefly stated. It had already been seen that parallel voltaic
currents attracted each other; when, instead of being parallel, they
were situate in any directions, they still exerted attractive and
repulsive forces depending on the distance, and on the directions of
each element of both currents. Add to this doctrine the hypothetical
constitution of magnets, namely, that a voltaic current runs round the
axis of each particle, and we have the means of calculating a vast
variety of results which may be compared with experiment. But the laws
of the elementary forces required further fixation. What
<em>functions</em> are the forces of the distance and the directions
of the elements?</p>
<p>To extract from experiment an answer to this inquiry was far from
easy, for the elementary forces were mathematically connected with the
observed facts, by a double mathematical integration;&#8212;a long,
and, while the constant coefficients remained undefined, hardly a
possible operation. Ampère made some trials in this way, but his
happier genius suggested to him a better path. It occurred to him,
that if his integrals, without being specially found, could be shown
to vanish upon the whole, under certain conditions of the problem,
this circumstance would correspond to arrangements of his apparatus in
which a state of equilibrium was preserved, however the form of some
of the parts might be changed. He found two such cases, which were of
great importance to the theory. The first of these cases proved that
the force exerted by any element of the voltaic wire might be resolved
into other forces by a theorem resembling the well-known proposition
of the parallelogram of forces. This was proved by showing that the
action of a straight wire is the same with that of another wire which
joins the same extremities, but is bent and contorted in any way
whatever. But it still remained necessary to determine two fundamental
quantities; one which expressed the <em>power</em> of the distance
according to which the force varied; the other, the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page249">249</a></span> degree in which the
force is affected by the <em>obliquity</em> of the elements. One of
the general causes of equilibrium, of which we have spoken, gave a
relation between these two quantities;<a id="fnanchor15-13"
href="#note15-13"><span class="fnanchor">15</span></a> and as the
power was naturally, and, as it afterwards appeared, rightly
conjectured to be the inverse square, the other quantity also was
determined; and the general problem of electrodynamical action was
fully solved.</p>

<p>If Ampère had not been an accomplished analyst, he would not have
been able to discover the condition on which the nullity of the
integral in this case depended.<a id="fnanchor16-13"
href="#note16-13"><span class="fnanchor">16</span></a> And throughout
his labors, we find reason to admire, both his mathematical skill, and
his steadiness of thought; although these excellences are by no means

exposition in his writings.</p>

<p><i>Reception of Ampère’s Theory.</i>&#8212;Clear mathematical
conceptions, and some familiarity with mathematical operations, were
needed by readers also, in order to appreciate the evidence of the
theory; and, therefore, we need not feel any surprise if it was, on
its publication and establishment, hailed with far less enthusiasm
than so remarkable a triumph of generalizing power might appear to
deserve. For some time, indeed, the greater portion of the public were
naturally held in suspense by the opposing weight of rival names. The
Amperian theory did not make its way without contention and
competition. The electro-magnetic experiments, from their first
appearance, gave a clear promise of some new and wide generalization;
and held out a prize of honor and fame to him who should be first in
giving the right interpretation of the riddle. In France, the
emulation for such reputation is perhaps more vigilant and anxious
than it is elsewhere; and we see, on this as on other occasions, the
scientific host of Paris springing upon a new subject with an
impetuosity which, in a short time, runs into controversies for
priority or for victory. In this case, M. Biot, as well as Ampère,
endeavored to reduce the electro-magnetic phenomena to general laws.
The discussion between him and Ampère turned on some points which are
curious. M. Biot was disposed to consider as an elementary action, the
force which an element of a voltaic wire exerts upon a magnetic
particle, and which is, as we have seen, at right angles to their
mutual distance; and he conceived that <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page250">250</a></span> the equal reaction which necessarily
accompanies this action acts oppositely to the action, not in the same
line, but in a parallel line, at the other extremity of the distance;
thus forming a primitive <i>couple</i>, to use a technical expression
borrowed from mechanics. To this Ampère objected,<a id="fnanchor17-13"
href="#note17-13"><span class="fnanchor">17</span></a> that the
<em>direct</em> opposition of all elementary action and reaction was a
universal and necessary mechanical law. He showed too that such a
couple as had been assumed, would follow as a <em>derivative</em>
result from his theory. And in comparing his own theory with that in
which the voltaic wire is assimilated to a collection of transverse
magnets, he was also able to prove that no such assemblage of forces
acting to and from fixed points, as the forces of magnets do act,
could produce a continued motion like that discovered by Faraday.
This, indeed, was only the well-known demonstration of the
impossibility of a perpetual motion. If, instead of a collection of
magnets, the adverse theorists had spoken of a magnetic
<i>current</i>, they might probably interpret their expressions so as
to explain the facts; that is, if they considered every element of
such a current as a magnet, and consequently, every point of it as
being a north and a south point at the same instant. But to introduce
such a conception of a magnetic current was to abandon all the laws of
magnetic action hitherto established; and consequently to lose all
that gave the hypothesis its value. The idea of an electric current,
on the other hand, was so far from being a new and hazardous
assumption, that it had already been forced upon philosophers from the
time of Volta; and in this current, the relation of <em>preceding</em>
and <em>succeeding</em>, which necessarily existed between the
extremities of any element, introduced that relative polarity on which
the success of the explanations of the facts depended. And thus in
this controversy, the theory of Ampère has a great and undeniable
superiority over the rival hypotheses.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Consequences of the Electrodynamic
Theory.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IT</span> is not necessary to state
the various applications which were soon made of the electro-magnetic
discoveries. But we may notice one <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page251">251</a></span> of the most important,&#8212;the
<i>Galvanometer</i>, an instrument which, by enabling the philosopher
to detect and to measure extremely minute electrodynamic actions, gave
an impulse to the subject similar to that which it received from the
invention of the Leyden Phial, or the Voltaic Pile. The strength of
the voltaic current was measured, in this instrument, by the
deflection produced in a compass-needle; and its sensibility was
multiplied by making the wire pass repeatedly above and below the
needle. Schweigger, of Halle, was one of the first devisers of this
apparatus.</p>
<p>The substitution of electro-magnets, that is, of spiral tubes
composed of voltaic wires, for common magnets, gave rise to a variety
of curious apparatus and speculations, some of which I shall hereafter
mention.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [When a voltaic apparatus is in action, there may be
conceived to be a current of electricity running through its various
elements, as stated in the text. The force of this current in various
parts of the circuit has been made the subject of mathematical
investigation by M. Ohm.<a id="fnanchor18-13" href="#note18-13"><span
class="fnanchor">18</span></a> The problem is in every respect similar
to that of the flow of heat through a body, and taken generally, leads
to complex calculations of the same kind. But Dr. Ohm, by limiting the
problem in the first place by conditions which the usual nature and
form of voltaic apparatus suggest, has been able to give great
simplicity to his reasonings. These conditions are, the linear form of
the conductors (wires) and the steadiness of the electric state. For
this part of the problem Dr. Ohm’s reasonings are as simple and as
demonstrative as the elementary propositions of Mechanics. The formulæ
for the electric force of a voltaic current to which he is led have
been experimentally verified by others, especially Fechner,<a

most important difficulties, and express the laws of a vast number of
phenomena <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page252">252</a></span> in
formulæ of remarkable simplicity and generality. In this Memoir,
Professor Wheatstone describes an instrument which he terms
<i>Rheostat</i>, because it brings to a common standard the voltaic
currents which are compared by it. He generalizes the language of the
subject by employing the term <i>rheomotor</i> for any apparatus which
originates an electric current (whether voltaic or thermoelectric,
&amp;c.) and <i>rheometer</i> for any instrument to measure the force
of such a current. It appears that the idea of constructing an
instrument of the nature of the Rheostat had occurred also to Prof.
Jacobi, of St Petersburg.]</p>

<p>The galvanometer led to the discovery of another class of cases in
which the electrodynamical action was called into play, namely, those
in which a circuit, composed of two metals only, became
electro-magnetic by <em>heating</em> one part of it. This discovery of
<i>thermo-electricity</i> was made by Professor Seebeck of Berlin, in
1822, and prosecuted by various persons; especially by Prof. Cumming<a
id="fnanchor22-13" href="#note22-13"><span
class="fnanchor">22</span></a> of Cambridge, who, early in 1823,
extended the examination of this property to most of the metals, and
determined their thermo-electric order. But as these investigations
exhibited no new mechanical effects of electromotive forces, they do
not now further concern us; and we pass on, at present, to a case in
which such forces act in a manner different from any of those already
described.</p>

<p class="center sc space-above" id="diamagnetism">Discovery of
Diamagnetism.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [By the discoveries just related, a cylindrical spiral of
wire through which an electric current is passing is identified with a
magnet; and the effect of such a spiral is increased by placing in it
a core of soft iron. By the use of such a combination under the
influence of a voltaic battery, magnets are constructed far more
powerful than those which depend upon the permanent magnetism of iron.
The electro-magnet employed by Dr. Faraday in some of his experiments
would sustain a hundred-weight at either end.</p>
<p>By the use of such magnets Dr. Faraday discovered that, besides
iron, nickel and cobalt, which possess magnetism in a high degree,
many bodies are magnetic in a slight degree. And he made the further
very important discovery, that of those substances which are not
magnetic, many, perhaps all, possess an opposite property, in virtue
of which he terms them <i>diamagnetic</i>. The opposition is of this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page253">253</a></span>
kind;&#8212;that magnetic bodies in the form of bars or needles, if
free to move, arrange themselves in the <em>axial</em> line joining
the poles; diamagnetic bodies under the same circumstances arrange
themselves in an <em>equatorial</em> position, perpendicular to the
axial line. And this tendency he conceives to be the result of one
more general; that whereas magnetic bodies are attracted to the poles
of a magnet, diamagnetic bodies are repelled from the poles. The list
of diamagnetic bodies includes all kinds of substances; not only
metals, as antimony, bismuth, gold, silver, lead, tin, zinc, but many
crystals, glass, phosphorus, sulphur, sugar, gum, wood, ivory; and
even flesh and fruit.</p>
<p>It appears that M. le Bailli had shown, in 1829, that both bismuth
and antimony and bismuth repelled the magnetic needle; and as Dr.
Faraday remarks, it is astonishing that such an experiment should have
remained so long without further results. M. Becquerel in 1827
observed, and quoted Coulomb as having also observed, that a needle of
wood under certain conditions pointed across the magnetic curves; and
also stated that he had found a needle of wood place itself parallel
to the wires of a galvanometer. This he referred to a magnetism
transverse to the length. But he does not refer the phenomena to
elementary repulsive action, nor show that they are common to an
immense class of bodies, nor distinguish this diamagnetic from the
magnetic class, as Faraday has taught us to do.</p>
<p>I do not dwell upon the peculiar phenomena of copper which, in the
same series of researches, are traced by Dr. Faraday to the combined
effect of its diamagnetic character, and the electric currents excited
in it by the electro-magnet; nor to the optical phenomena manifested
by certain transparent diamagnetic substances under electric action;

<span class="sc">Discovery of the Laws of Magneto-Electric
Induction.&#8212;Faraday.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IT</span> was clearly established by
Ampère, as we have seen, that magnetic action is a peculiar form of
electromotive actions, and that, in <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page254">254</a></span> this kind of agency, action and reaction
are equal and opposite. It appeared to follow almost irresistibly from
these considerations, that magnetism might be made to produce
electricity, as electricity could be made to imitate all the effects
of magnetism. Yet for a long time the attempts to obtain such a result
were fruitless. Faraday, in 1825, endeavored to make the
conducting-wire of the voltaic circuit excite electricity in a
neighboring wire by induction, as the conductor charged with common
electricity would have done, but he obtained no such effect. If this
attempt had succeeded, the magnet, which, for all such purposes, is an
assemblage of voltaic circuits, might also have been made to excite
electricity. About the same time, an experiment was made in France by
M. Arago, which really involved the effect thus sought; though this
effect was not extricated from the complex phenomenon, till Faraday
began his splendid career of discovery on this subject in 1832.
Arago’s observation was, that the rapid revolution of a
conducting-plate in the neighborhood of a magnet, gave rise to a force
acting on the magnet. In England, Messrs. Barlow and Christie,
Herschel and Babbage, repeated and tried to analyse this experiment;
but referring the forces only to conditions of space and time, and
overlooking the real cause, the electrical currents produced by the
motion, these philosophers were altogether unsuccessful in their
labors. In 1831, Faraday again sought for electro-dynamical induction,
and after some futile trials, at last found it in a form different
from that in which he had looked for it. It was then seen, that at the
precise time of making or breaking the contact which closed the
galvanic circuit, a momentary effect was induced in a neighboring
wire, but disappeared instantly.<a id="fnanchor24-13"
href="#note24-13"><span class="fnanchor">24</span></a> Once in
possession of this fact, Mr. Faraday ran rapidly up the ladder of
discovery, to the general point of view.&#8212;Instead of suddenly
making or breaking the contact of the inducing circuit, a similar
effect was produced by removing the inducible wire nearer to or
further from the circuit;<a id="fnanchor25-13" href="#note25-13"><span
class="fnanchor">25</span></a>&#8212;the effects were increased by the
proximity of soft iron;<a id="fnanchor26-13" href="#note26-13"><span
class="fnanchor">26</span></a>&#8212;when the soft iron was affected
by an ordinary magnet instead of the voltaic wire, the same effect
still recurred;<a id="fnanchor27-13" href="#note27-13"><span
class="fnanchor">27</span></a>&#8212;and thus it appeared, that by
making and breaking magnetic contact, a momentary electric current was
produced. It was produced also by moving the magnet;<a
id="fnanchor28-13" href="#note28-13"><span

reference to the magnet.<a id="fnanchor29-13" href="#note29-13"><span

<p>But the question occurs, What is the general law which determines
the direction of electric currents thus produced by the joint effects
of motion and magnetism? Nothing but a peculiar steadiness and
clearness in his conceptions of space, could have enabled Mr. Faraday
to detect the law of this phenomenon. For the question required that
he should determine the mutual relations in space which connect the
magnetic poles, the position of the wire, the direction of the wire’s
motion, and the electrical current produced in it. This was no easy
problem; indeed, the mere relation of the magnetic to the electric
forces, the one set being perpendicular to the other, is of itself
sufficient to perplex the mind; as we have seen in the history of the
electrodynamical discoveries. But Mr. Faraday appears to have seized
at once the law of the phenomena. “The relation,” he says,<a
id="fnanchor35-13" href="#note35-13"><span
class="fnanchor">35</span></a> “which holds between the magnetic pole,
the moving wire or metal, and the direction of the current evolved, is
very simple (so it seemed to him) although rather difficult to
express.” He represents it by referring position and motion to the
“magnetic curves,” which go from a magnetic pole to the opposite pole.
The current in the wire sets one way or the other, according to the
direction in which the motion of the wire cuts these curves. And thus
he was enabled, at the end of his Second Series of <i>Researches</i>
(December, 1831), to give, in general terms, the law of nature to
which may be referred the extraordinary number of new and curious
experiments which he has stated;<a id="fnanchor36-13"
href="#note36-13"><span class="fnanchor">36</span></a>&#8212;namely,
that if a wire move so as to cut a magnetic curve, a power is called
into action which tends to urge a magnetic current through the wire;
and that if a mass move so that its parts do not move in the same
direction across the magnetic curves, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page256">256</a></span> and with the same angular velocity,
electrical currents are called into play in the mass.</p>

<p>This rule, thus simple from its generality, though inevitably
complex in every special case, may be looked upon as supplying the
first demand of philosophy, <i>the law of the phenomena</i>; and
accordingly Dr. Faraday has, in all his subsequent researches on
magneto-electric induction, applied this law to his experiments; and
has thereby unravelled an immense amount of apparent inconsistency and
confusion, for those who have followed him in his mode of conceiving
the subject.</p>
<p>But yet other philosophers have regarded these phenomena in other
points of view, and have stated the laws of the phenomena in a manner
different from Faraday’s, although for the most part equivalent to
his. And these attempts to express, in the most simple and general
form, the law of the phenomena of magneto-electrical induction, have
naturally been combined with the expression of other laws of
electrical and magnetical phenomena. Further, these endeavors to
connect and generalize the Facts have naturally been clothed in the
garb of various Theories:&#8212;the <i>laws of phenomena</i> have been
expressed in terms of the supposed <i>causes of the phenomena</i>; as
fluids, attractions and repulsions, particles with currents running
through them or round them, physical lines of force, and the like.
Such views, and the conflict of them, are the natural and hopeful
prognostics of a theory which shall harmonize their discords and
include all that each contains of Truth. The fermentation at present
is perhaps too great to allow us to see clearly the truth which lies
at the bottom. But a few of the leading points of recent discussions
on these subjects will be noticed in the <a href="#v2page618">Additions</a>

<span class="sc">Transition to Chemical Science.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> preceding train of
generalization may justly appear extensive, and of itself well worthy
of admiration. Yet we are to consider all that has there been
established as only one-half of the science to which it
belongs,&#8212;one limb of the colossal form of Chemistry. We <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page257">257</a></span> have ascertained, we
will suppose, the laws of Electric Polarity; but we have then to ask,
What is the relation of this Polarity to Chemical Composition? This
was the great problem which, constantly present to the minds of
electro-chemical inquirers, drew them on, with the promise of some
deep and comprehensive insight into the mechanism of nature. Long
tasks of research, though only subsidiary to this, were cheerfully
undertaken. Thus Faraday<a id="fnanchor37-13" href="#note37-13"><span
class="fnanchor">37</span></a> describes himself as compelled to set
about satisfying himself of the identity of common, animal, and
voltaic electricity, as “the decision of a doubtful point which
interfered with the extension of his views, and destroyed the
strictness of reasoning.” Having established this identity, he
proceeded with his grand undertaking of electro-chemical research.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note37-13"
href="#fnanchor37-13">37</a></span> Dec. 1832. <i>Researches</i>,

<p>The connexion of electrical currents with chemical action, though
kept out of sight in the account we have hitherto given, was never
forgotten by the experimenters; for, in fact, the modes in which
electrical currents were excited, were chemical actions;&#8212;the
action of acids and metals on each other in the voltaic trough, or in
some other form. The dependence of the electrical effect on these
chemical actions, and still more, the chemical actions produced by the
agency of the poles of the circuit, had been carefully studied; and we
must now relate with what success.</p>
<p>But in what terms shall we present this narration? We have spoken
of chemical actions,&#8212;but what kind of actions are these?
<i>Decomposition</i>; the <i>resolution</i> of compounds into their
ingredients; the separation of <i>acids</i> from <i>bases</i>; the
reduction of bodies to <i>simple elements</i>. These names open to us
a new drama; they are words which belong to a different set of
relations of things, a different train of scientific inductions, a
different system of generalizations, from any with which we have
hitherto been concerned. We must learn to understand these phrases,
before we can advance in our history of human knowledge.</p>
<p>And how are we to learn the meaning of this collection of words? In
what other language shall it be explained? In what terms shall we
define these new expressions? To this we are compelled to reply, that
we cannot translate these terms into any ordinary language;&#8212;that
we cannot define them in any terms already familiar to us. Here, as in
all other branches of knowledge, the meaning of words is to be sought
in the progress of thought; the history of science is our <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page258">258</a></span> dictionary; the steps
of scientific induction are our definitions. It is only by going back
through the successful researches of men respecting the composition
and elements of bodies, that we can learn in what sense such terms
must be understood, so as to convey real knowledge. In order that they
may have a meaning for us, we must inquire what meaning they had in
the minds of the authors of our discoveries.</p>
<p>And thus we cannot advance a step, till we have brought up our
history of Chemistry to the level of our history of
Electricity;&#8212;till we have studied the progress of the
analytical, as well as the mechanical sciences. We are compelled to
pause and look backwards here; just as happened in the history of
astronomy, when we arrived at the brink of the great mechanical
inductions of Newton, and found that we must trace the history of
Mechanics, before we could proceed to mechanical Astronomy. The terms
“force, attraction, inertia, momentum,” sent us back into preceding
centuries then, just as the terms “composition” and “element” send us
back now.</p>
<p>Nor is it to a small extent that we have thus to double back upon
our past advance. Next to Astronomy, Chemistry is one of the most
ancient of sciences;&#8212;the field of the earliest attempts of man
to command and understand nature. It has held men for centuries by a
kind of fascination; and innumerable and endless are the various
labors, the failures and successes, the speculations and conclusions,
the strange pretences and fantastical dreams, of those who have
pursued it. To exhibit all these, or give any account of them, would
be impossible; and for our design, it would not be pertinent. To
extract from the mass that which is to our purpose, is difficult; but
the attempt must be made. We must endeavor to analyse the history of
Chemistry, so far as it has tended towards the establishment of
general principles. We shall thus obtain a sight of generalizations of
a new kind, and shall prepare ourselves for others of a higher
order.</p>

<span class="sc">Improvement of the Notion of Chemical Analysis, and
Recognition of it as the Spagiric Art.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> doctrine of “the four
elements” is one of the oldest monuments of man’s speculative nature;
goes back, perhaps, to times anterior to Greek philosophy; and as the
doctrine of Aristotle and Galen, reigned for fifteen hundred years
over the Gentile, Christian, and Mohammedan world. In medicine, taught
as the doctrine of the four “elementary qualities,” of which the human
body and all other substances are compounded, it had a very powerful
and extensive influence upon medical practice. But this doctrine never
led to any attempt actually to analyse bodies into their supposed
elements: for composition was inferred from the resemblance of the
qualities, not from the separate exhibition of the ingredients; the
supposed analysis was, in short, a decomposition of the body into
adjectives, not into substances.</p>
<p>This doctrine, therefore, may be considered as a negative state,
antecedent to the very beginning of chemistry; and some progress
beyond this mere negation was made, as soon as men began to endeavor
to compound and decompound substances by the use of fire or mixture,
however erroneous might be the opinions and expectations which they
combined with their attempts. Alchemy is a step in chemistry, so far
as it implies the recognition of the work of the cupel and the retort,
as the produce of analysis and synthesis. How perplexed and perverted
were the forms in which this recognition was clothed,&#8212;how mixed
up with mythical follies and extravagancies, we have <a
href="#v1page224">already</a> seen; and the share which Alchemy had in
the formation of any sounder knowledge, is not such as to justify any
further notice of that pursuit.</p>
<p>The result of the attempts to analyse bodies by heat, mixture, and
the like processes, was the doctrine that the first principles of
things are <em>three</em>, not four; namely, <i>salt</i>,
<i>sulphur</i>, and <i>mercury</i>; and that, of these three, all
things are compounded. In reality, the doctrine, as thus stated,
contained no truth which was of any value; for, though the chemist
could extract from most bodies portions which he called salt, <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page262">262</a></span> and sulphur, and
mercury, these names were given, rather to save the hypothesis, than
because the substances were really those usually so called: and thus
the supposed analyses proved nothing, as Boyle justly urged against
them.<a id="fnanchor1-14" href="#note1-14"><span
class="fnanchor">1</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-14"
href="#fnanchor1-14">1</a></span> Shaw’s Boyle. <i>Skeptical
Chymist</i>, pp. 312, 313. &amp;c.</div>
<p>The only real advance in chemical theory, therefore, which we can
ascribe to the school of <i>the three principles</i>, as compared with
those who held the ancient dogma of the four elements, is, the
acknowledgment of the changes produced by the chemist’s operations, as
being changes which were to be accounted for by the union and
separation of substantial elements, or, as they were sometimes called,
of <i>hypostatical principles</i>. The workmen of this school
acquired, no doubt, a considerable acquaintance with the results of
the kinds of processes which they pursued; they applied their
knowledge to the preparation of new medicines; and some of them, as
Paracelsus and Van Helmont, attained, in this way, to great fame and
distinction: but their merits, as regards theoretical chemistry,
consist only in a truer conception of the problem, and of the mode of
attempting its solution, than their predecessors had entertained.</p>
<p>This step is well marked by a word which, about the time of which
we speak, was introduced to denote the chemist’s employment. It was
called the <i>Spagiric art</i>, (often misspelt <i>Spagyric</i>,) from
two Greek words, (σπάω, ἀγείρω,) which mean to <em>separate</em>
parts, and to <em>unite</em> them. These two processes, or in more
modern language, <i>analysis</i> and <i>synthesis</i>, constitute the
whole business of the chemist. We are not making a fanciful
arrangement, therefore, when we mark the recognition of this object as
a step in the progress of chemistry. I now proceed to consider the
manner in which the conditions of this analysis and synthesis were
further developed.</p>
<hr class="three space-above" />
<h3>CHAPTER II.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Doctrine of Acid and
Alkali.&#8212;Sylvius.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">AMONG</span> the results of mixture
observed by chemists, were many instances in which two ingredients,
each in itself pungent or destructive, being put together, became mild
and inoperative; each <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page263">263</a></span> counteracting and neutralizing the
activity of the other. The notion of such opposition and neutrality is
applicable to a very wide range of chemical processes. The person who
appears first to have steadily seized and generally applied this
notion is Francis de la Boé Sylvius; who was born in 1614, and
practised medicine at Amsterdam, with a success and reputation which
gave great currency to his opinions on that art.<a id="fnanchor2-14"
href="#note2-14"><span class="fnanchor">2</span></a> His chemical
theories were propounded as subordinate to his medical doctrines; and
from being thus presented under a most important practical aspect,
excited far more attention than mere theoretical opinions on the
composition of bodies could have done. Sylvius is spoken of by
historians of science, as the founder of the <i>iatro-chemical</i>
sect among physicians; that is, the sect which considers the disorders
in the human frame as the effects of chemical relations of the fluids,
and applies to them modes of cure founded upon this doctrine. We have
here to speak, not of his physiological, but of his chemical
views.</p>

href="#fnanchor2-14">2</a></span> Sprengel. <i>Geschichte der
Arzneykunde</i>, vol. iv. Thomson’s <i>History of Chemistry</i> in the
corresponding part is translated from Sprengel.</div>
<p>The distinction of <i>acid</i> and <i>alkaline</i> bodies
(<i>acidum</i>, <i>lixivum</i>) was familiar before the time of
Sylvius; but he framed a system, by considering them both as eminently
acrid and yet opposite, and by applying this notion to the human
frame. Thus<a id="fnanchor3-14" href="#note3-14"><span
class="fnanchor">3</span></a> the lymph contains an acid, the bile an
alkaline salt. These two opposite acrid substances, when they are
brought together, <i>neutralize</i> each other (<i>infringunt</i>),
and are changed into an intermediate and milder substance.</p>

href="#fnanchor3-14">3</a></span> <i>De Methodo Medendi</i>, Amst.
1679. Lib. ii. cap. 28, sects. 8 and 53.</div>
<p>The progress of this doctrine, as a physiological one, is an
important part of the history of medical science in the seventeenth
century; but with that we are not here concerned. But as a chemical
doctrine, this notion of the opposition of acid and alkali, and of its
very general applicability, struck deep root, and has not been
eradicated up to our own time. Boyle, indeed, whose disposition led
him to suspect all generalities, expressed doubts with regard to this
view;<a id="fnanchor4-14" href="#note4-14"><span
class="fnanchor">4</span></a> and argued that the supposition of acid
and alkaline parts in all bodies was precarious, their offices
arbitrary, and the notion of them unsettled. Indeed it was not
difficult to show, that there was no one certain criterion to which
all supposed acids conformed. Yet the general conception of such a
combination as that of acid and alkali was supposed to <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page264">264</a></span> be, served so well to
express many chemical facts, that it kept its ground. It is found, for
instance, in Lemery’s <i>Chemistry</i>, which was one of those in most
general use before the introduction of the phlogistic theory. In this
work (which was translated into English by Keill, in 1698) we find
alkalies defined by their effervescing with acids.<a id="fnanchor5-14"
href="#note5-14"><span class="fnanchor">5</span></a> They were
distinguished as the <i>mineral</i> alkali (soda), the
<i>vegetable</i> alkali (potassa), and the <i>volatile</i> alkali
(ammonia). Again, in Macquer’s <i>Chemistry</i>, which was long the
text-book in Europe during the reign of phlogiston, we find acids and
alkalies, and their union, in which they rob each other of their
characteristic properties, and form neutral salts, stated among the
leading principles of the science.<a id="fnanchor6-14"
href="#note6-14"><span class="fnanchor">6</span></a></p>

<p>In truth, the mutual relation of acids to alkalies was the most
essential part of the knowledge which chemists possessed concerning
them. The importance of this relation arose from its being the first
distinct form in which the notion of chemical attraction or affinity
appeared. For the acrid or caustic character of acids and alkalies is,
in fact, a tendency to alter the bodies they touch, and thus to alter
themselves; and the neutral character of the compounds <span
class="correction" title="emended from in">is</span> the absence of
any such proclivity to change. Acids and alkalies have a strong
disposition to unite. They combine, often with vehemence, and produce
neutral salts; they exhibit, in short, a prominent example of the
chemical attraction, or affinity, by which two ingredients are formed
into a compound. The relation of <i>acid</i> and <i>base</i> in a salt
is, to this day, one of the main grounds of all theoretical
reasonings.</p>
<p>The more distinct development of the notion of such chemical
attraction, gradually made its way among the chemists of the latter
part of the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth century,
as we may see in the writings of Boyle, Newton, and their followers.
Beecher speaks of this attraction as a <i>magnetism</i>; but I do not
know that any writer in particular, can be pointed out as the person
who firmly established the general notion of <i>chemical
attraction</i>.</p>
<p>But this idea of chemical attraction became both more clear and
more extensively applicable, when it assumed the form of the doctrine
of <i>elective</i> attractions, in which shape we must now speak of
it. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page265">265</a></span></p>
<h3 class="space-above">CHAPTER III.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Doctrine of Elective Attractions. Geoffroy.
Bergman.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THOUGH</span> the chemical
combinations of bodies had already been referred to attraction, in a
vague and general manner, it was impossible to explain the changes
that take place, without supposing the attraction to be greater or
less, according to the nature of the body. Yet it was some time before
the necessity of such a supposition was clearly seen. In the history
of the French Academy for 1718 (published 1719), the writer of the
introductory notice (probably Fontenelle) says, “That a body which is
united to another, for example, a solvent which has penetrated a
metal, should quit it to go and unite itself with another which we
present to it, is a thing of which the possibility had never been
guessed by the most subtle philosophers, and of which the explanation
even now is not easy.” The doctrine had, in fact, been stated by
Stahl, but the assertion just quoted shows, at least, that it was not
familiar. The principle, however, is very clearly stated<a
id="fnanchor7-14" href="#note7-14"><span class="fnanchor">7</span></a>
in a memoir in the same volume, by Geoffroy, a French physician of
great talents and varied knowledge, “We observe in chemistry,” he
says, “certain relations amongst different bodies, which cause them to
unite. These relations have their <i>degrees</i> and their
<i>laws</i>. We observe their different degrees in this;&#8212;that
among different matters jumbled together, which have a certain
disposition to unite, we find that one of these substances always
unites constantly with a certain other, preferably to all the rest.”
He then states that those which unite by preference, have “plus de
rapport,” or, according to a phrase afterwards used, more
<i>affinity</i>. “And I have satisfied myself,” he adds, “that we may
deduce, from these observations, the following proposition, which is
very extensively true, though I cannot enunciate it as universal, not
having been able to examine all the possible combinations, to assure
myself that I should find no exception.” The proposition which he
states in this admirable spirit of philosophical caution, is this: “In
all cases where two substances, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page266">266</a></span> which have any disposition to combine,
are united; if there approaches them a third, which has more affinity
with one of the two, this one unites with the third and lets go the
other.” He then states these affinities in the form of a Table;
placing a substance at the head of each column, and other substances
in succession below it, according to the order of their affinities for
the substance which stands at the head. He allows that the separation
is not always complete (an imperfection which he ascribes to the
glutinosity of fluids and other causes), but, with such exceptions, he
defends very resolutely and successfully his Table, and the notions
which it implies.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note7-14"
href="#fnanchor7-14">7</a></span> <i>Mém. Acad. Par.</i> 1718, p.
202.</div>
<p>The value of such a tabulation was immense at the time, and is even
still very great; it enabled the chemist to trace beforehand the
results of any operation; since, when the ingredients were given, he
could see which were the strongest of the affinities brought into
play, and, consequently, what compounds would be formed. Geoffroy
himself gave several good examples of this use of his table. It was
speedily adopted into works on chemistry. For instance, Macquer<a
id="fnanchor8-14" href="#note8-14"><span class="fnanchor">8</span></a>
places it at the end of his book; “taking it,” as he says, “to be of
great use at the end of an elementary tract, as it collects into one

<p>The doctrine of <i>Elective Attraction</i>, as thus promulgated,
contained so large a mass of truth, that it was never seriously
shaken, though it required further development and correction. In
particular the celebrated work of Torbern Bergman, professor at
Upsala, <i>On Elective Attractions</i>, published in 1775, introduced
into it material improvements. Bergman observed, that not only the
order of attractions, but the sum of those attractions which had to
form the new compounds, must be taken account of, in order to judge of
the result. Thus,<a id="fnanchor9-14" href="#note9-14"><span
class="fnanchor">9</span></a> if we have a combination of two
elements, <i>P</i>, <i>s</i>, (potassa and vitriolic acid), and
another combination, <i>L</i>, <i>m</i>, (lime and muriatic acid,)
though <i>s</i> has a greater affinity for <i>P</i> than for <i>L</i>,
yet the sum of the attractions of <i>P</i> to <i>m</i>, and of
<i>L</i> to <i>s</i>, is greater than that of the original compounds,
and therefore if the two combinations are brought together, the new
compounds, <i>P</i>, <i>m</i>, and <i>L</i>, <i>s</i>, are formed.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note9-14"
href="#fnanchor9-14">9</a></span> <i>Elect. Attract.</i>, p. 19.</div>
<p>The Table of Elective Attractions, modified by Bergman in pursuance
of these views, and corrected according to the advanced knowledge of
the time, became still more important than before. The next step <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page267">267</a></span> was to take into
account the quantities of the elements which combined; but this leads
us into a new train of investigation, which was, indeed, a natural
sequel to the researches of Geoffroy and Bergman.</p>
<p>In 1803, however, a chemist of great eminence, Berthollet,
published a work (<i>Essai de Statique Chimique</i>), the tendency of
which appeared to be to throw the subject back into the condition in
which it had been before Geoffroy. For Berthollet maintained that the
rules of chemical combination were not definite, and dependent on the
nature of the substances alone, but indefinite, depending on the
quantity present, and other circumstances. Proust answered him, and as
Berzelius says,<a id="fnanchor10-14" href="#note10-14"><span
class="fnanchor">10</span></a> “Berthollet defended himself with an
acuteness which makes the reader hesitate in his judgment; but the
great mass of facts finally decided the point in favor of Proust.”
Before, however, we trace the result of these researches, we must
consider Chemistry as extending her inquiries to combustion as well as
mixture, to airs as well as fluids and solids, and to weight as well
as quality. These three steps we shall now briefly treat of.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Doctrine of Acidification and
Combustion.&#8212;Phlogistic Theory.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">PUBLICATION</span> <i>of the Theory
by Beccher and Stahl.</i>&#8212;It will be recollected that we are
tracing the history of the <em>progress</em> only of Chemistry, not of
its errors;&#8212;that we are concerned with doctrines only so far as
they are true, and have remained part of the received system of
chemical truths. The Phlogistic Theory was deposed and succeeded by
the Theory of Oxygen. But this circumstance must not lead us to
overlook the really sound and permanent part of the opinions which the
founders of the phlogistic theory taught. They brought together, as
processes of the same kind, a number of changes which at first
appeared to have nothing in common; as acidification, combustion,
respiration. Now this classification is true; and its importance
remains undiminished, whatever are the explanations which we adopt of
the processes themselves.</p>
<p>The two chemists to whom are to be ascribed the merit of this step,
and the establishment of the <i>phlogistic theory</i> which they
connected <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page268">268</a></span> with
it, are John Joachim Beccher and George Ernest Stahl; the former of
whom was professor at Mentz, and physician to the Elector of Bavaria
(born 1625, died 1682); the latter was professor at Halle, and
afterwards royal physician at Berlin (born 1660, died 1734). These two
men, who thus contributed to a common purpose, were very different
from each other. The first was a frank and ardent enthusiast in the
pursuit of chemistry, who speaks of himself and his employments with a
communicativeness and affection both amusing and engaging. The other
was a teacher of great talents and influence, but accused of
haughtiness and moroseness; a character which is well borne out by the
manner in which, in his writings, he anticipates an unfavorable
reception, and defies it. But it is right to add to this that he
speaks of Beccher, his predecessor, with an ungrudging acknowledgment
of obligations to him, and a vehement assertion of his merit as the
founder of the true system, which give a strong impression of Stahl’s
justice and magnanimity.</p>
<p>Beccher’s opinions were at first promulgated rather as a correction
than a refutation of the doctrine of the three principles, salt,
sulphur, and mercury. The main peculiarity of his views consists in
the offices which he ascribes to his <i>sulphur</i>, these being such
as afterwards induced Stahl to give the name of <i>Phlogiston</i> to
this element. Beccher had the sagacity to see that the reduction of
metals to an earthy form (<i>calx</i>), and the formation of sulphuric
acid from sulphur, are operations connected by a general analogy, as
being alike processes of combustion. Hence the metal was supposed to
consist of an earth, and of something which, in the process of
combustion, was separated from it; and, in like manner, sulphur was
supposed to consist of the sulphuric acid, which remained after its
combustion, and of the combustible part or true sulphur, which flew
off in the burning. Beccher insists very distinctly upon this
difference between his element sulphur and the “sulphur” of his
Paracelsian predecessors.</p>
<p>It must be considered as indicating great knowledge and talent in
Stahl, that he perceived so clearly what part of the views of Beccher
was of general truth and permanent value. Though he<a
id="fnanchor11-14" href="#note11-14"><span
class="fnanchor">11</span></a> everywhere gives to Beccher the credit
of the theoretical opinions which he promulgates, (“Beccheriana sunt
quæ profero,”) it seems certain that he had the merit, not only of
proving them more completely, and applying them more widely than his
forerunner, but also of conceiving them <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page269">269</a></span> with a distinctness which Beccher did
not attain. In 1697, appeared Stahl’s <i>Zymotechnia Fundamentalis</i>
(the Doctrine of Fermentation), “simulque <i>experimentum novum</i>
sulphur verum arte producendi.” In this work (besides other tenets
which the author considered as very important), the opinion published
by Beccher was now maintained in a very distinct form;&#8212;namely,
that the process of forming sulphur from sulphuric acid, and of
restoring the metals from their calces, are analogous, and consist
alike in the addition of some combustible element, which Stahl termed
<i>phlogiston</i> (φλογίστον, <i>combustible</i>). The experiment most
insisted on in the work now spoken of,<a id="fnanchor12-14"
href="#note12-14"><span class="fnanchor">12</span></a> was the
formation of sulphur from sulphate of potass (or of soda) by fusing
the salt with an alkali, and throwing in coals to supply phlogiston.
This is the “experimentum novum.” Though Stahl published an account of
this process, he seems to have regretted his openness. “He denies
not,” he says, “that he should peradventure have dissembled this
experiment as the true foundation of the Beccherian assertion
concerning the nature of sulphur, if he had not been provoked by the
pretending arrogance of some of his contemporaries.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note11-14"

Becch.</i> 1703.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note12-14"
href="#fnanchor12-14">12</a></span> P. 117.</div>
<p>From this time, Stahl’s confidence in his theory may be traced
becoming more and more settled in his succeeding publications. It is
hardly necessary to observe here, that the explanations which his
theory gives are easily transformed into those which the more recent
theory supplies. According to modern views, the addition of oxygen
takes place in the formation of acids and of calces, and in
combustion, instead of the subtraction of phlogiston. The coal which
Stahl supposed to supply the combustible in his experiment, does in
fact absorb the liberated oxygen. In like manner, when an acid
corrodes a metal, and, according to existing theory, combines with and
oxidates it, Stahl supposed that the phlogiston separated from the
metal and combined with the acid. That the explanations of the
phlogistic theory are so generally capable of being translated into
the oxygen theory, merely by inverting the supposed transfer of the
combustible element, shows us how important a step towards the modern
doctrines the phlogistic theory really was.</p>
<p>The question, whether these processes were in fact addition or
subtraction, was decided by the balance, and belongs to a succeeding
period of the science. But we may observe, that both Beccher and Stahl
were aware of the increase of weight which metals undergo in <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page270">270</a></span> calcination; although
the time had not yet arrived in which this fact was to be made one of
the bases of the theory.</p>
<p>It has been said,<a id="fnanchor13-14" href="#note13-14"><span
class="fnanchor">13</span></a> that in the adoption of the phlogistic
theory, that is, in supposing the above-mentioned processes to be
addition rather than subtraction, “of two possible roads the wrong was
chosen, as if to prove the perversity of the human mind.” But we must
not forget how natural it was to suppose that some part of a body was
<em>destroyed</em> or <em>removed</em> by combustion; and we may
observe, that the merit of Beccher and Stahl did not consist in the
selection of one road or two, but in advancing so far as to reach this
point of separation. That, having done this, they went a little
further on the wrong line, was an error which detracted little from
the merit or value of the progress really made. It would be easy to
show, from the writings of phlogistic chemists, what important and
extensive truths their theory enabled them to express simply and
clearly.</p>

href="#fnanchor13-14">13</a></span> Herschel’s <i>Introd. to Nat.
Phil.</i> p. 300.</div>
<p>That an enthusiastic temper is favorable to the production of great
discoveries in science, is a rule which suffers no exception in the
character of Beccher. In his preface<a id="fnanchor14-14"
href="#note14-14"><span class="fnanchor">14</span></a> addressed “to
the benevolent reader” of his <i>Physica Subterranea</i>, he speaks of
the chemists as a strange class of mortals, impelled by an almost
insane impulse to seek their pleasure among smoke and vapor, soot and
flame, poisons and poverty. “Yet among all these evils,” he says, “I
seem to myself to live so sweetly, that, may I die if I would change
places with the Persian king.” He is, indeed, well worthy of
admiration, as one of the first who pursued the labors of the furnace
and the laboratory, without the bribe of golden hopes. “My kingdom,”
he says, “is not of this world. I trust that I have got hold of my
pitcher by the right handle,&#8212;the true method of treating this
study. For the <em>Pseudochymists</em> seek gold; but the <em>true
philosophers</em>, science, which is more precious than any gold.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note14-14"
href="#fnanchor14-14">14</a></span> Frankfort, 1681.</div>
<p>The <i>Physica Subterranea</i> made no converts. Stahl, in his
indignant manner, says,<a id="fnanchor15-14" href="#note15-14"><span
class="fnanchor">15</span></a> “No one will wonder that it never yet
obtained a physician or a chemist as a disciple, still less as an
advocate.” And again, “This work obtained very little reputation or
estimation, or, to speak ingenuously, as far as I know, none
whatever.” In 1671, Beccher published a supplement to his work, in
which he showed how metal might be extracted from mud and sand. He
offered to execute <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page271">271</a></span> this at Vienna; but found that people
there cared nothing about such novelties. He was then induced, by
Baron D’Isola, to go to Holland for similar purposes. After various
delays and quarrels, he was obliged to leave Holland for fear of his
creditors; and then, I suppose, came to Great Britain, where he
examined the Scottish and Cornish mines. He is said to have died in
London in 1682.</p>

<p>Stahl’s publications appear to have excited more notice, and led to
controversy on the “so-called sulphur.” The success of the experiment
had been doubted, which, as he remarks, it was foolish to make a
matter of discussion, when any one might decide the point by
experiment; and finally, it had been questioned whether the substance
obtained by this process were pure sulphur. The originality of his
doctrine was also questioned, which, as he says, could not with any
justice be impugned. He published in defence and development of his
opinion at various intervals, as the <i>Specimen Beccherianum</i> in
1703, the <i>Documentum Theoriæ Beecherianæ</i>, a Dissertation <i>De
Anatomia Sulphuris Artificialis</i>; and finally, <i>Casual Thoughts
on the so-called Sulphur</i>, in 1718, in which he gave (in German)
both a historical and a systematic view of his opinions on the nature
of salts and of his Phlogiston.</p>
<p><i>Reception and Application of the Theory.</i>&#8212;The theory
that the formation of sulphuric acid, and the restoration of metals
from their calces, are analogous processes, and consist in the
addition of <i>phlogiston</i>, was soon widely received; and the
Phlogistic School was thus established. From Berlin, its original
seat, it was diffused into all parts of Europe. The general reception
of the theory may be traced, not only in the use of the term
“phlogiston,” and of the explanations which it implies; but in the
adoption of a nomenclature founded on those explanations, which,
though not very extensive, is sufficient evidence of the prevalence of
the theory. Thus when Priestley, in 1774, discovered oxygen, and when
Scheele, a little later, discovered chlorine, these gases were termed
<i>dephlogisticated air</i>, and <i>dephlogisticated marine acid</i>;
while azotic acid gas, having no disposition to combustion, was
supposed to be saturated with phlogiston, and was called
<i>phlogisticated air</i>.</p>
<p>This phraseology kept its ground, till it was expelled by the
antiphlogistic, or oxygen theory. For instance. Cavendish’s papers on
the chemistry of the airs are expressed in terms of it, although his
researches led him to the confines of the new theory. We must now give
an account of such researches, and of the consequent revolution in the
science. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page272">272</a></span></p>
<h3 class="space-above">CHAPTER V.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Chemistry of Gases.&#8212;Black.
Cavendish.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> study of the properties of
aëriform substances, or Pneumatic Chemistry, as it was called,
occupied the chemists of the eighteenth century, and was the main
occasion of the great advances which the science made at that period.
The most material general truths which came into view in the course of
these researches, were, that gases were to be numbered among the
constituent elements of solid and fluid bodies; and that, in these, as
in all other cases of composition, the compound was equal to the sum
of its elements. The latter proposition, indeed, cannot be looked upon
as a discovery, for it had been frequently acknowledged, though little
applied; in fact, it could not be referred to with any advantage, till
the aëriform elements, as well as others, were taken into the account.
As soon as this was done, it produced a revolution in chemistry.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [Though the view of the mode in which gaseous elements
become fixed in bodies and determine their properties, had great
additional light thrown upon it by Dr. Black’s discoveries, as we
shall see, the notion that solid bodies involve such gaseous elements
was not new at that period. Mr. Vernon Harcourt has shown<a
id="fnanchor16-14" href="#note16-14"><span
class="fnanchor">16</span></a> that Newton and Boyle admitted into
their speculations airs of various kinds, capable of fixation in
bodies. I have, in the succeeding chapter (<a href="#v2page277">chap.
vi.</a>), spoken of the views of Rey, Hooke, and Mayow, connected with
the function of airs in chemistry, and forming a prelude to the Oxygen
Theory.]</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note16-14"
href="#fnanchor16-14">16</a></span> <i>Phil. Mag.</i> 1846.</div>
<p>Notwithstanding these preludes, the credit of the first great step
in pneumatic chemistry is, with justice, assigned to Dr. Black,
afterwards professor at Edinburgh, but a young man of the age of
twenty-four at the time when he made his discovery.<a
id="fnanchor17-14" href="#note17-14"><span
class="fnanchor">17</span></a> He found that the difference between
caustic lime and common limestone arose from this, that the latter
substance consists of the former, combined with a certain air, which,
being thus fixed in the solid body, he called <i>fixed air</i>
(carbonic <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page273">273</a></span> acid
gas). He found, too, that magnesia, caustic potash, and caustic soda,
would combine with the same air, with similar results. This discovery
consisted, of course, in a new interpretation of observed changes.
Alkalies appeared to be made caustic by contact with quicklime: at
first Black imagined that they underwent this change by acquiring
igneous matter from the quicklime; but when he perceived that the lime
gained, not lost, in magnitude as it became mild, he rightly supposed
that the alkalies were rendered caustic by imparting their air to the
lime. This discovery was announced in Black’s inaugural dissertation,
pronounced in 1755, on the occasion of his taking his degree of Doctor
in the University of Edinburgh.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note17-14"
href="#fnanchor17-14">17</a></span> Thomson’s <i>Hist. Chem.</i> i.
317.</div>
<p>The chemistry of airs was pursued by other experimenters. The
Honorable Henry Cavendish, about 1765, invented an apparatus, in which
aërial fluids are confined by water, so that they can be managed and
examined. This hydro-pneumatic apparatus, or as it is sometimes
called, <i>the pneumatic trough</i>, from that time was one of the
most indispensable parts of the chemist’s apparatus. Cavendish,<a
id="fnanchor18-14" href="#note18-14"><span
class="fnanchor">18</span></a> in 1766, showed the identity of the
properties of fixed air derived from various sources; and pointed out
the peculiar qualities of <i>inflammable air</i> (afterwards called
hydrogen gas), which, being nine times lighter than common air, soon
attracted general notice by its employment for raising balloons. The
promise of discovery which this subject now offered, attracted the
confident and busy mind of Priestley, whose <i>Experiments and
Observations on different kinds of Air</i> appeared in 1744&#8211;79.
In these volumes, he describes an extraordinary number of trials of
various kinds; the results of which were, the discovery of new kinds
of air, namely, <i>phlogisticated air</i> (azotic gas), <i>nitrous
air</i> (nitrous gas), and <i>dephlogisticated air</i> (oxygen
gas).</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note18-14"
href="#fnanchor18-14">18</a></span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1766.</div>
<p>But the discovery of new substances, though valuable in supplying
chemistry with materials, was not so important as discoveries
respecting their modes of composition. Among such discoveries, that of
Cavendish, published in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> for
1784, and disclosing the composition of water by the union of two
gases, oxygen and hydrogen, must be considered as holding a most
distinguished place. He states,<a id="fnanchor19-14"
href="#note19-14"><span class="fnanchor">19</span></a> that his
“experiments were made principally with a view to find out the cause
of the diminution which common air is well known to suffer, by all the
various ways in which it is phlogisticated.” And, after describing
various unsuccessful attempts, he finds <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page274">274</a></span> that when inflammable air is used in
this phlogistication (or burning), the diminution of the common air is
accompanied by the formation of a dew in the apparatus.<a
id="fnanchor20-14" href="#note20-14"><span
class="fnanchor">20</span></a> And thus he infers<a id="fnanchor21-14"
href="#note21-14"><span class="fnanchor">21</span></a> that “almost
all the inflammable air, and one-fifth of the common air, are turned
into pure water.”</p>

<p>Lavoisier, to whose researches this result was, as we shall soon
see, very important, was employed in a similar attempt at the same
time (1783), and had already succeeded,<a id="fnanchor22-14"
href="#note22-14"><span class="fnanchor">22</span></a> when he learned
from Dr. Blagden, who was present at the experiment, that Cavendish
had made the discovery a few months sooner. Monge had, about the same
time, made the same experiments, and communicated the result to
Lavoisier and Laplace immediately afterwards. The synthesis was soon
confirmed by a corresponding analysis. Indeed the discovery
undoubtedly lay in the direct path of chemical research at the time.
It was of great consequence in the view it gave of experiments in
composition; for the small quantity of water produced in many such
processes, had been quite overlooked; though, as it now appeared, this
water offered the key to the whole interpretation of the change.</p>

<p>Though some objections to Mr. Cavendish’s view were offered by
Kirwan,<a id="fnanchor23-14" href="#note23-14"><span
class="fnanchor">23</span></a> on the whole they were generally
received with assent and admiration. But the bearing of these
discoveries upon the new theory of Lavoisier, who rejected phlogiston,
was so close, that we cannot further trace the history of the subject
without proceeding immediately to that theory.</p>

expressed my concurrence with Mr. Vernon Harcourt’s views, when he
says,<a id="fnanchor25-14" href="#note25-14"><span

current hypotheses their theory of combustion, and their affinities of
imponderable for ponderable matter, as complicating chemical with
physical considerations; and he then corrected and adjusted them with
admirable skill to the actual phenomena, not binding the facts to the
theory, but adapting the theory to the facts.”</p>

<p>I conceive that the discussion which the subject has recently
received, has left no doubt on the mind of any one who has perused the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page275">275</a></span> documents, that
Cavendish is justly entitled to the honor of this discovery, which in
his own time was never contested. The publication of his Journals of
Experiments<a id="fnanchor26-14" href="#note26-14"><span
class="fnanchor">26</span></a> shows that he succeeded in establishing
the point in question in July, 1781. His experiments are referred to
in an abstract of a paper of Priestley’s, made by Dr. Maty, the
secretary of the Royal Society, in June, 1783. In June, 1783, also,
Dr. Blagden communicated the result of Cavendish’s experiments to
Lavoisier, at Paris. Watt’s letter, containing his hypothesis that
“water is composed of dephlogisticated air and phlogiston deprived of
part of their latent or elementary heat; and that phlogisticated or
pure air is composed of water deprived of its phlogiston and united to
elementary heat and light,” was not read till Nov. 1783; and even if
it could have suggested such an experiment as Cavendish’s (which does
not appear likely), is proved, by the dates, to have had no share in
doing so.</p>

naturally gave it an almost irresistible sway over men’s minds. We
must, however, dispassionately trace the course of its introduction.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page276">276</a></span></p>
<p>Antoine Laurent Lavoisier, an accomplished French chemist, had
pursued, with zeal and skill, researches such as those of Black,
Cavendish, and Priestley, which we have described above. In 1774, he
showed that, in the calcination of metals in air, the metal acquires
as much weight as the air loses. It might appear that this discovery
at once overturned the view which supposed the metal to be phlogiston
<em>added</em> to the calx. Lavoisier’s contemporaries were, however,
far from allowing this; a greater mass of argument was needed to bring
them to this conclusion. Convincing proofs of the new opinion were,
however, rapidly supplied. Thus, when Priestley had discovered
dephlogisticated air, in 1774, Lavoisier showed, in 1776, that fixed
air consisted of charcoal and the dephlogisticated or pure air; for
the mercurial calx which, heated by itself, gives out pure air, gives
out, when heated with charcoal, fixed air,<a id="fnanchor27-14"
href="#note27-14"><span class="fnanchor">27</span></a> which has,
therefore, since been called <i>carbonic acid gas</i>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note27-14"
href="#fnanchor27-14">27</a></span> <i>Mém. Ac. Par.</i> 1775.</div>
<p>Again, Lavoisier showed that the atmospheric air consists of pure
or vital air, and of an <i>unvital</i> air, which he thence called
<i>azot</i>. The vital air he found to be the agent in combustion,
acidification, calcination, respiration; all of these processes were
analogous: all consisted in a decomposition of the atmospheric air,
and a fixation of the pure or vital portion of it.</p>
<p>But he thus arrived at the conclusion, that this pure air was
added, in all the cases in which, according to the received theory,
<i>phlogiston</i> was subtracted, and <i>vice versâ</i>. He gave the
name<a id="fnanchor28-14" href="#note28-14"><span
class="fnanchor">28</span></a> of <i>oxygen</i> (<i>principe
oxygène</i>) to “the substance which thus unites itself with metals to
form their calces, and with combustible substances to form acids.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note28-14"
href="#fnanchor28-14">28</a></span> <i>Mém. Ac. Par.</i> 1781, p.
448.</div>
<p>A new theory was thus produced, which would account for all the
facts which the old one would explain, and had besides the evidence of
the balance in its favor. But there still remained some apparent
objections to be removed. In the action of dilute acids on metals,
inflammable air was produced. Whence came this element? The discovery
of the decomposition of water sufficiently answered this question, and
converted the objection into an argument on the side of the theory:
and thus the decomposition of water was, in fact, one of the most
critical events for the fortune of the Lavoisierian doctrine, and one
which, more than any other, decided chemists in its favor. In
succeeding years, Lavoisier showed the consistency of his theory with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page277">277</a></span> all that was
discovered concerning the composition of alcohol, oil, animal and
vegetable substances, and many other bodies.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for us to consider any further the evidence for
this theory, but we must record a few circumstances respecting its
earlier history. Rey, a French physician, had in 1630, published a
book, in which he inquires into the grounds of the increase of the
weight of metals by calcination.<a id="fnanchor29-14"
href="#note29-14"><span class="fnanchor">29</span></a> He says, “To
this question, then, supported on the grounds already mentioned, I
answer, and maintain with confidence, that the increase of weight
arises from the air, which is condensed, rendered heavy and adhesive,
by the heat of the furnace.” Hooke and Mayow had entertained the
opinion that the air contains a “nitrous spirit,” which is the
supporter of combustion. But Lavoisier disclaimed the charge of having
derived anything from these sources; nor is it difficult to understand
how the received generalizations of the phlogistic theory had thrown
all such narrower explanations into obscurity. The merit of Lavoisier
consisted in his combining the generality of Stahl with the verified
conjectures of Rey and Mayow.</p>

95.</div>
<p>No one could have a better claim, by his early enthusiasm for
science, his extensive knowledge, and his zealous labors, to hope that
a great discovery might fall to his share, than Lavoisier. His
father,<a id="fnanchor30-14" href="#note30-14"><span
class="fnanchor">30</span></a> a man of considerable fortune, had
allowed him to make science his only profession; and the zealous
philosopher collected about him a number of the most active physical
inquirers of his time, who met and experimented at his house one day
in the week. In this school, the new chemistry was gradually formed. A
few years after the publication of Priestley’s first experiments,
Lavoisier was struck with the presentiment of the theory which he was
afterwards to produce. In 1772, he deposited<a id="fnanchor31-14"
href="#note31-14"><span class="fnanchor">31</span></a> with the
secretary of the Academy, a note which contained the germ of his
future doctrines. “At that time,” he says, in explaining this step,
“there was a kind of rivalry between France and England in science,
which gave importance to new experiments, and which sometimes was the
cause that the writers of the one or other of the nations disputed the
discovery with the real author.” In 1777, the editor of the Memoirs of
the Academy speaks of his theory as overturning that of Stahl; but the
general acceptance of the new opinion did not take place till
later.</p>

Cavendish’s synthesis of water had removed some of the most formidable
objections to it, Berthollet, already an eminent chemist, declared
himself a convert. Indeed it was so soon generally adopted in France,
that Fourcroy promulgated its doctrines under the name of “La Chimie
Française,” a title which Lavoisier did not altogether relish. The
extraordinary eloquence and success of Fourcroy as a lecturer at the
Jardin des Plantes, had no small share in the diffusion of the oxygen
theory; and the name of “the apostle of the new chemistry” which was
at first given him in ridicule, was justly held by him to be a
glorious distinction.<a id="fnanchor33-14" href="#note33-14"><span

<p>Guyton de Morveau, who had at first been a strenuous advocate of
the phlogistic theory, was invited to Paris, and brought over to the
opinions of Lavoisier; and soon joined in the formation of the
nomenclature founded upon the theory. This step, of which we shall
shortly speak, fixed the new doctrine, and diffused it further.
Delametherie alone defended the phlogistic theory with vigor, and
indeed with violence. He was the editor of the <i>Journal de
Physique</i>, and to evade the influence which this gave him, the
antiphlogistians<a id="fnanchor34-14" href="#note34-14"><span
class="fnanchor">34</span></a> established, as the vehicle of their
opinions, another periodical, the <i>Annales de Chimie</i>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note34-14"
href="#fnanchor34-14">34</a></span> Thomson, ii. 133.</div>
<p>In England, indeed, their success was not so immediate.
Cavendish,<a id="fnanchor35-14" href="#note35-14"><span
class="fnanchor">35</span></a> in his Memoir of 1784, speaks of the
question between the two opinions as doubtful. “There are,” he says,
“several Memoirs of M. Lavoisier, in which he entirely discards
phlogiston; and as not only the foregoing experiments, but most other
phenomena of nature, seem explicable as well, or nearly as well, upon
this as upon the commonly believed principle of phlogiston,” Cavendish
proceeds to explain his experiments according to the new views,
expressing no decided preference, however, for either system. But
Kirwan, another English chemist, contested the point much more
resolutely. His theory identified inflammable air, or hydrogen, with
phlogiston; and in this view, he wrote a work which was intended as a
confutation of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page279">279</a></span>
the essential part of the oxygen theory. It is a strong proof of the
steadiness and clearness with which the advocates of the new system
possessed their principles, that they immediately translated this
work, adding, at the end of each chapter, a refutation of the
phlogistic doctrines which it contained. Lavoisier, Berthollet, De
Morveau, Fourcroy, and Monge, were the authors of this curious
specimen of scientific polemics. It is also remarkable evidence of the
candor of Kirwan, that notwithstanding the prominent part he had taken
in the controversy, he allowed himself at last to be convinced. After
a struggle of ten years, he wrote<a id="fnanchor36-14"
href="#note36-14"><span class="fnanchor">36</span></a> to Berthollet
in 1796, “I lay down my arms, and abandon the cause of phlogiston.”
Black followed the same course. Priestley alone, of all the chemists
of great name, would never assent to the new doctrines, though his own
discoveries had contributed so much to their establishment. “He saw,”
says Cuvier,<a id="fnanchor37-14" href="#note37-14"><span
class="fnanchor">37</span></a> “without flinching, the most skilful
defenders of the ancient theory go over to the enemy in succession;
and when Kirwan had, almost the last of all, abjured phlogiston,
Priestley remained alone on the field of battle, and threw out a new
challenge, in a memoir addressed to the principal French chemists.” It
happened, curiously enough, that the challenge was accepted, and the
arguments answered by M. Adet, who was at that time (1798,) the French
ambassador to the United States, in which country Priestley’s work was
published. Even in Germany, the birth-place and home of the phlogistic
theory, the struggle was not long protracted. There was, indeed, a
controversy, the older philosophers being, as usual, the defenders of
the established doctrines; but in 1792, Klaproth repeated, before the
Academy of Berlin, all the fundamental experiments; and “the result
was a full conviction on the part of Klaproth and the Academy, that
the Lavoisierian theory was the true one.”<a id="fnanchor38-14"
href="#note38-14"><span class="fnanchor">38</span></a> Upon the whole,
the introduction of the Lavoisierian theory in the scientific world,
when compared with the great revolution of opinion to which it comes
nearest in importance, the introduction of the Newtonian theory,
shows, by the rapidity and temper with which it took place, a great
improvement, both in the means of arriving at truth, and in the spirit
with which they were used.</p>

<p>Some English writers<a id="fnanchor39-14" href="#note39-14"><span

was <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page280">280</a></span> little that
was original in the new doctrines. But if they were so obvious, what
are we to say of eminent chemists, as Black and Cavendish, who
hesitated when they were presented, or Kirwan and Priestley, who
rejected them? This at least shows that it required some peculiar
insight to see the evidence of these truths. To say that most of the
materials of Lavoisier’s theory existed before him, is only to say
that his great merit was, that which must always be the great merit of
a new theory, his generalization. The effect which the publication of
his doctrines produced, shows us that he was the first person who,
possessing clearly the idea of quantitative composition, applied it
steadily to a great range of well-ascertained facts. This is, as we
have often had to observe, precisely the universal description of an
inductive discoverer. It has been objected, in like manner, to the
originality of Newton’s discoveries, that they were contained in those
of Kepler. They were so, but they needed a Newton to find them there.
The originality of the theory of oxygen is proved by the conflict,
short as it was, which accompanied its promulgation; its importance is
shown by the changes which it soon occasioned in every part of the
science.</p>

<p>Thus Lavoisier, far more fortunate than most of those who had, in
earlier ages, produced revolutions in science, saw his theory accepted
by all the most eminent men of his time, and established over a great
part of Europe within a few years from its first promulgation. In the
common course of events, it might have been expected that the later
years of his life would have been spent amid the admiration and
reverence which naturally wait upon the patriarch of a new system of
acknowledged truths. But the times in which he lived allowed no such
euthanasia to eminence of any kind. The democracy which overthrew the
ancient political institutions of France, and swept away the nobles of
the land, was not, as might have been expected, enthusiastic in its
admiration of a great revolution in science, and forward to offer its
homage to the genuine nobility of a great discoverer. Lavoisier was
thrown into prison on some wretched charge of having, in the discharge
of a public office which he had held, adulterated certain tobacco; but
in reality, for the purpose of confiscating his property.<a
id="fnanchor40-14" href="#note40-14"><span
class="fnanchor">40</span></a> In his imprisonment, his philosophy was
his resource; and he employed himself in the preparation of his papers
for printing. When he was brought before the revolutionary tribunal,
he begged for a respite of a few days, in order to complete some
researches, the results of which <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page281">281</a></span> were, he said, important to the good of
humanity. The brutish idiot, whom the state of the country at that
time had placed in the judgment-seat, told him that the republic
wanted no sçavans. He was dragged to the guillotine, May the 8th,
1794, and beheaded, in the fifty-second year of his age; a melancholy
proof that, in periods of political ferocity, innocence and merit,
private virtues and public services, amiable manners and the love of
friends, literary fame and exalted genius, are all as nothing to
protect their possessor from the last extremes of violence and wrong,
inflicted under judicial forms.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Nomenclature of the Oxygen
Theory.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">As</span> we have already said, a
powerful instrument in establishing and diffusing the new chemical
theory, was a Systematic Nomenclature founded upon it, and applicable
to all chemical compounds, which was soon constructed and published by
the authors of the theory. Such a nomenclature made its way into
general use the more easily, in that the want of such a system had
already been severely felt; the names in common use being fantastical,
arbitrary, and multiplied beyond measure. The number of known
substances had become so great, that a list of names with no
regulative principle, founded on accident, caprice, and error, was too
cumbrous and inconvenient to be tolerated. Even before the currency
which Lavoisier’s theory obtained, these evils had led to attempts
towards a more convenient set of names. Bergman and Black had
constructed such lists; and Guyton de Morveau, a clever and
accomplished lawyer of Dijon, had formed a system of nomenclature in
1782, before he had become a convert to Lavoisier’s theory, in which
task he had been exhorted and encouraged by Bergman and Macquer. In
this system,<a id="fnanchor41-14" href="#note41-14"><span
class="fnanchor">41</span></a> we do not find most of the characters
of the method which was afterwards adopted. But a few years later,
Lavoisier, De Morveau, Berthollet and Fourcroy, associated themselves
for the purpose of producing a nomenclature which should correspond to
the new theoretical views. This appeared in 1787, and soon made its
way into general use. The main features of this system are, a
selection of the simplest radical words, by which substances are
designated, and a systematic distribution of terminations, to express
their relations. Thus, sulphur, combined with oxygen in two different
proportions, forms two acids, the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page282">282</a></span> sulphur<em>ous</em> and the
sulphur<em>ic</em>; and these acids form, with earthy or alkaline
bases, sulph<em>ides</em> and sulph<em>ates</em>; while sulphur
directly combined with another element, forms a sulph<em>uret</em>.
The term <i>oxyd</i> (now usually written <i>oxide</i>) expressed a
lower degree of combination with oxygen than the acids. The <i>Méthode
de Nomenclature Chimique</i> was published in 1787; and in 1789,
Lavoisier published a treatise on chemistry in order further to
explain this method. In the preface to this volume, he apologizes for
the great amount of the changes, and pleads the authority of Bergman,
who had exhorted De Morveau “to spare no improper names; those who are
learned will always be learned, and those who are ignorant will thus
learn sooner.” To this maxim they so far conformed, that their system
offers few anomalies; and though the progress of discovery, and the
consequent changes of theoretical opinion, which have since gone on,
appear now to require a further change of nomenclature, it is no small
evidence of the skill with which this scheme was arranged, that for
half a century it was universally used, and felt to be far more useful
and effective than any nomenclature in any science had ever been
before.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Application and Correction of the Oxygen
Theory.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">SINCE</span> a chemical theory, as
far as it is true, must enable us to obtain a true view of the
intimate composition of all bodies whatever, it will readily be
supposed that the new chemistry led to an immense number of analyses
and researches of various kinds. These it is not necessary to dwell
upon; nor will I even mention the names of any of the intelligent and
diligent men who have labored in this field. Perhaps one of the most
striking of such analyses was Davy’s decomposition of the earths and
alkalies into metallic bases and oxygen, in 1807 and 1808; thus
extending still further that analogy between the earths and the calces
of the metals, which had had so large a share in the formation of
chemical theories. This discovery, however, both in the means by which
it was made, and in the views to which it led, bears upon subjects
hereafter to be treated of.</p>
<p>The Lavoisierian theory also, wide as was the range of truth which
it embraced, required some limitation and correction. I do not now
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page283">283</a></span> speak of some
erroneous opinions entertained by the author of the theory; as, for
instance, that the heat produced in combustion, and even in
respiration, arose from the conversion of oxygen gas to a solid
consistence, according to the doctrine of latent heat. Such opinions
not being necessarily connected with the general idea of the theory,
need not here be considered. But the leading generalization of
Lavoisier, that acidification was <em>always</em> combination with
oxygen, was found untenable. The point on which the contest on this
subject took place was the constitution of the <i>oxymuriatic</i> and
<i>muriatic</i> acids;&#8212;as they had been termed by Berthollet,
from the belief that muriatic acid contained oxygen, and oxymuriatic a
still larger dose of oxygen. In opposition to this, a new doctrine was
put forward in 1809 by Gay-Lussac and Thenard in France, and by Davy
in England;&#8212;namely, that oxymuriatic acid was a simple
substance, which they termed <i>chlorine</i>, and that muriatic acid
was a combination of chlorine with hydrogen, which therefore was
called <i>hydrochloric acid</i>. It may be observed, that the point in
dispute in the controversy on this subject was nearly the same which
had been debated in the course of the establishment of the oxygen
theory; namely, whether in the formation of muriatic acid from
chlorine, oxygen is subtracted, or hydrogen added, and the water
concealed.</p>
<p>In the course of this dispute, it was allowed on both sides, that
the combination of dry muriatic acid and ammonia afforded an
<i>experimentum crucis</i>; since, if water was produced from these
elements, oxygen must have existed in the acid. Davy being at
Edinburgh in 1812, this experiment was made in the presence of several
eminent philosophers; and the result was found to be, that though a
slight dew appeared in the vessel, there was not more than might be
ascribed to unavoidable imperfection in the process, and certainly not
so much as the old theory of muriatic acid required. The new theory,
after this period, obtained a clear superiority in the minds of
philosophical chemists, and was further supported by new analogies.<a
id="fnanchor42-14" href="#note42-14"><span
class="fnanchor">42</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note42-14"
href="#fnanchor42-14">42</a></span> Paris, <i>Life of Davy</i>, i.
337.</div>
<p>For, the existence of one <i>hydracid</i> being thus established,
it was found that other substances gave similar combinations; and thus
chemists obtained the <i>hydriodic</i>, <i>hydrofluoric</i>, and
<i>hydrobromic</i> acids. These acids, it is to be observed, form
salts with bases, in the same manner as the oxygen acids do. The
analogy of the muriatic and fluoric compounds was first clearly urged
by a philosopher who was <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page284">284</a></span> not peculiarly engaged in chemical
research, but who was often distinguished by his rapid and happy
generalizations, M. Ampère. He supported this analogy by many
ingenious and original arguments, in letters written to Davy, while
that chemist was engaged in his researches on fluor spar, as Davy
himself declares.<a id="fnanchor43-14" href="#note43-14"><span
class="fnanchor">43</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note43-14"
href="#fnanchor43-14">43</a></span> Paris, <i>Life of Davy</i>, i.
370.</div>
<p>Still further changes have been proposed, in that classification of
elementary substances to which the oxygen theory led. It has been held
by Berzelius and others, that other elements, as, for example,
sulphur, form <em>salts</em> with the alkaline and earthy metals,
rather than sulphurets. The character of these <i>sulpho-salts</i>,
however, is still questioned among chemists; and therefore it does not
become us to speak as if their place in history were settled. Of
course, it will easily be understood that, in the same manner in which
the oxygen theory introduced its own proper nomenclature, the
overthrow or material transformation of the theory would require a
change in the nomenclature; or rather, the anomalies which tended to
disturb the theory, would, as they were detected, make the theoretical
terms be felt as inappropriate, and would suggest the necessity of a
reformation in that respect. But the discussion of this point belongs
to a step of the science which is to come before us <a
href="#v2page308">hereafter</a>.</p>
<p>It may be observed, that in approaching the limits of this part of
our subject, as we are now doing, the doctrine of the combination of
<i>acids</i> and <i>bases</i>, of which we formerly traced the rise
and progress, is still assumed as a fundamental relation by which
other relations are tested. This remark connects the stage of
chemistry now under our notice with its earliest steps. But in order
to point out the chemical bearing of the next subjects of our
narrative, we may further observe, that <i>metals</i>, <i>earths</i>,
<i>salts</i>, are spoken of as known <i>classes</i> of substances; and
in like manner the newly-discovered elements, which form the last
trophies of chemistry, have been distributed into such classes
according to their analogies; thus <i>potassium</i>, <i>sodium</i>,
<i>barium</i>, have been asserted to be metals; <i>iodine</i>,
<i>bromine</i>, <i>fluorine</i>, have been arranged as analogical to
<i>chlorine</i>. Yet there is something vague and indefinite in the
boundaries of such classifications and analogies; and it is precisely
where this vagueness falls, that the science is still obscure or
doubtful. We are led, therefore, to see the dependence of Chemistry
upon Classification; and it is to Sciences of Classification which we
shall next proceed; as soon as we have noticed the most general views
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page285">285</a></span> which have been
given of chemical relations, namely, the views of the
electro-chemists.</p>
<p>But before we do this, we must look back upon a law which obtains
in the combination of elements, and which we have hitherto not stated;
although it appears, more than any other, to reveal to us the intimate
constitution of bodies, and to offer a basis for future
generalizations. I speak of the <i>Atomic Theory</i>, as it is usually
termed; or, as we might rather call it, the Doctrine of Definite,
Reciprocal, and Multiple Proportions.</p>

to his discovery, as one of the great events of the history of
chemistry, I speak only of the <i>law of phenomena</i>, the rules
which govern the quantities in which elements combine.</p>
<p>This law may be considered as consisting of three parts, according
to the above description of it;&#8212;that elements combine in
<em>definite</em> proportions;&#8212;that these determining
proportions operate <em>reciprocally</em>;&#8212;and that when,
between the same elements, several combining proportions occur, they
are related as <em>multiples</em>.</p>
<p>That elements combine in certain definite proportions of quantity,
and in no other, was implied, as soon as it was supposed that chemical
compounds had any definite properties. Those who first attempted to
establish regular formulæ<a id="fnanchor44-14" href="#note44-14"><span
class="fnanchor">44</span></a> for the constitution of salts,
minerals, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page286">286</a></span>
other compounds, assumed, as the basis of this process, that the
elements in different specimens had the same proportion. Wenzel, in
1777, published his <i>Lehre von der Verwandschaft der Körper</i>; or,
<i>Doctrine of the Affinities of Bodies</i>; in which he gave many
good and accurate analyses. His work, it is said, never grew into
general notice. Berthollet, as we have <a
href="#v2page267">already</a> stated, maintained that chemical
compounds were not definite; but this controversy took place at a
later period. It ended in the establishment of the doctrine, that
there is, for each combination, only one proportion of the elements,
or at most only two or three.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note44-14"
href="#fnanchor44-14">44</a></span> Thomson, <i>Hist. Chem.</i> vol.
ii. p. 279.</div>
<p>Not only did Wenzel, by his very attempt, presume the first law of
chemical composition, the definiteness of the proportions, but he was
also led, by his results, to the second rule, that they are
reciprocal. For he found that when two <em>neutral</em> salts
decompose each other, the resulting salts are also neutral. The
neutral character of the salts shows that they are definite compounds;
and when the two elements of the one salt, <i>P</i> and <i>s</i>, are
presented to those of the other, <i>B</i> and <i>n</i>, if <i>P</i> be
in such quantity as to combine definitely with <i>n</i>, <i>B</i> will
also combine definitely with <i>s</i>.<a id="fnanchor45-14"
href="#note45-14"><span class="fnanchor">45</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note45-14"
href="#fnanchor45-14">45</a></span> I am told that Wenzel (whose book
I have not seen), though he adduces many cases in which double
decomposition gives neutral salts, does not express the proposition in
a general form, nor use letters in expressing it.</div>
<p>Views similar to those of Wenzel were also published by Jeremiah
Benjamin Richter<a id="fnanchor46-14" href="#note46-14"><span
class="fnanchor">46</span></a> in 1792, in his <i>Anfangsgründe der
Stöchyometrie, oder Messkunst Chymischer Elemente</i>, (<i>Principles
of the Measure of Chemical Elements</i>) in which he took the law,
just stated, of reciprocal proportions, as the basis of his
researches, and determined the numerical quantities of the common
bases and acids which would saturate each other. It is clear that, by
these steps, the two first of our three rules may be considered as
fully developed. The change of general views which was at this time
going on, probably prevented chemists from feeling so much interest as
they might have done otherwise, in these details; the French and
English chemists, in particular, were fully employed with their own
researches and controversies.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note46-14"
href="#fnanchor46-14">46</a></span> Thomson, <i>Hist. Chem.</i> vol.
ii. p. 283.</div>
<p>Thus the rules which had already been published by Wenzel and
Richter had attracted so little notice, that we can hardly consider
Mr. Dalton as having been anticipated by those writers, when, in 1803,
he began to communicate his views on the chemical constitution of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page287">287</a></span> bodies; these
views being such as to include both these two rules in their most
general form, and further, the rule, at that time still more new to
chemists, of <em>multiple</em> proportions. He conceived bodies as
composed of atoms of their constituent elements, grouped, either one
and one, or one and two, or one and three, and so on. Thus, if
<i>C</i> represent an atom of carbon and <i>O</i> one of oxygen, <i>O
C</i> will be an atom of <i>carbonic oxide</i>, and <i>O C O</i> an
atom of <i>carbonic acid</i>; and hence it follows, that while both
these bodies have a definite quantity of oxygen to a given quantity of
carbon, in the latter substance this quantity is <em>double</em> of
what it is in the former.</p>
<p>The consideration of bodies as consisting of compound atoms, each
of these being composed of elementary atoms, naturally led to this law
of multiple proportions. In this mode of viewing bodies, Mr. Dalton
had been preceded (unknown to himself) by Mr. Higgins, who, in 1789,
published<a id="fnanchor47-14" href="#note47-14"><span
class="fnanchor">47</span></a> his <i>Comparative View of the
Phlogistic and Antiphlogistic Theories</i>. He there says,<a
id="fnanchor48-14" href="#note48-14"><span
class="fnanchor">48</span></a> “That in volatile vitriolic acid, a
single ultimate particle of sulphur is united only to a single
particle of dephlogisticated air; and that in perfect vitriolic acid,
every single particle of sulphur is united to two of dephlogisticated
air, being the quantity necessary to saturation;” and he reasons in
the same manner concerning the constitution of water, and the
compounds of nitrogen and oxygen. These observations of Higgins were,
however, made casually, and not followed out, and cannot affect
Dalton’s claim to original merit.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note47-14"

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note48-14"
href="#fnanchor48-14">48</a></span> P. 36 and 37.</div>
<p>Mr. Dalton’s generalization was first suggested<a
id="fnanchor49-14" href="#note49-14"><span
class="fnanchor">49</span></a> during his examination of olefiant gas
and carburetted hydrogen gas; and was asserted generally, on the
strength of a few facts, being, as it were, irresistibly recommended
by the clearness and simplicity which the notion possessed. Mr. Dalton
himself represented the compound atoms of bodies by symbols, which
professed to exhibit the arrangement of the elementary atoms in space
as well as their numerical proportion; and he attached great
importance to this part of his scheme. It is clear, however, that this
part of his doctrine is not essential to that numerical comparison of
the law with facts, on which its establishment rests. These
hypothetical configurations of atoms have no value till they are
confirmed by corresponding facts, such as the optical or crystalline
properties of bodies may perhaps one day furnish.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Reception and Confirmation of the Atomic
Theory.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">In</span> order to give a sketch of
the progress of the Atomic Theory into general reception, we cannot do
better than borrow our information mainly from Dr. Thomson, who was
one of the earliest converts and most effective promulgators of the
doctrine. Mr. Dalton, at the time when he conceived his theory, was a
teacher of mathematics at Manchester, in circumstances which might
have been considered narrow, if he himself had been less simple in his
manner of life, and less moderate in his worldly views. His
experiments were generally made with apparatus of which the simplicity
and cheapness corresponded to the rest of his habits. In 1804, he was
already in possession of his atomic theory, and explained it to Dr.
Thomson, who visited him at that time. It was made known to the
chemical world in Dr. Thomson’s <i>Chemistry</i>, in 1807; and in
Dalton’s own <i>System of Chemistry</i> (1808) the leading ideas of it
were very briefly stated. Dr. Wollaston’s memoir, “on superacid and
subacid salts,” which appeared in the <i>Philosophical
Transactions</i> for 1808, did much to secure this theory a place in
the estimation of chemists. Here the author states, that he had
observed, in various salts, the quantities of acid combined with the
base in the neutral and in the superacid salts to be as one to two:
and he says that, thinking it likely this law might obtain generally
in such compounds, it was his design to have pursued this subject,
with the hope of discovering the cause to which so regular a relation
may be ascribed. But he adds, that this appears to be superfluous
after the publication of Dalton’s theory by Dr. Thomson, since all
such facts are but special cases of the general law. We cannot but
remark here, that the scrupulous timidity of Wollaston was probably
the only impediment to his anticipating Dalton in the publication of
the rule of multiple proportions; and the forwardness to generalize,
which belongs to the character of the latter, justly secured him, in
this instance, the name of the discoverer of this law. The rest of the
English chemists soon followed Wollaston and Thomson, though Davy for
some time resisted. They objected, indeed, to Dalton’s assumption of
atoms, and, to avoid this hypothetical step, Wollaston used the phrase
<i>chemical equivalents</i>, and Davy the word <i>proportions</i>, for
the numbers which expressed Dalton’s atomic weights. We may, however,
venture to say that the term “atom” is the most convenient, and it
need not be understood as claiming our assent to the hypothesis of
indivisible molecules. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page289">289</a></span></p>
<p>As Wollaston and Dalton were thus arriving independently at the
same result in England, other chemists, in other countries, were,
unknown to each other, travelling towards the same point.</p>
<p>In 1807, Berzelius,<a id="fnanchor50-14" href="#note50-14"><span
class="fnanchor">50</span></a> intending to publish a system of
chemistry, went through several works little read, and among others
the treatises of Richter. He was astonished, he tells us, at the light
which was there thrown upon composition and decomposition, and which
had never been turned to profit. He was led to a long train of
experimental research, and, when he received information of Dalton’s
ideas concerning multiple proportions, he found, in his own collection
of analyses, a full confirmation of this theory.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note50-14"

<p>Some of the Germans, indeed, appear discontented with the partition
of reputation which has taken place with respect to the Theory of
Definite Proportions. One<a id="fnanchor51-14" href="#note51-14"><span
class="fnanchor">51</span></a> of them says, “Dalton has only done
this;&#8212;he has wrapt up the good Richter (whom he knew; compare
Schweigger, T, older series, vol. x., p. 381;) in a ragged suit,
patched together of atoms; and now poor Richter comes back to his own
country in such a garb, like Ulysses, and is not recognized.” It is to
be recollected, however, that Richter says nothing of multiple
proportions.</p>

202.</div>
<p>The general doctrine of the atomic theory is now firmly established
over the whole of the chemical world. There remain still several
controverted points, as, for instance, whether the atomic weights of
all elements are exact multiples of the atomic weight of hydrogen. Dr.
Prout advanced several instances in which this appeared to be true,
and Dr. Thomson has asserted the law to be of universal application.
But, on the other hand, Berzelius and Dr. Turner declare that this
hypothesis is at variance with the results of the best analyses. Such
controverted points do not belong to our history, which treats only of
the progress of scientific truths already recognized by all competent
judges.</p>
<p>Though Dalton’s discovery was soon generally employed, and
universally spoken of with admiration, it did not bring to him
anything but barren praise, and he continued in the humble employment
of which we have spoken, when his fame had filled Europe, and his name
become a household word in the laboratory. After some years he was
appointed a corresponding member of the Institute of France; which may
be considered as a European recognition of the importance <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page290">290</a></span> of what he had done;
and, in 1826, two medals for the encouragement of science having been
placed at the disposal of the Royal Society by the King of England,
one of them was assigned to Dalton, “for his development of the atomic
theory.” In 1833, at the meeting of the British Association for the
Advancement of Science, which was held in Cambridge, it was announced
that the King had bestowed upon him a pension of 150<i>l.</i>; at the
preceding meeting at Oxford, that university had conferred upon him
the degree of Doctor of Laws, a step the more remarkable, since he
belonged to the sect of Quakers. At all the meetings of the British
Association he has been present, and has always been surrounded by the
reverence and admiration of all who feel any sympathy with the
progress of science. May he long remain among us thus to remind us of
the vast advance which Chemistry owes to him!</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [Soon after I wrote these expressions of hope, the period
of Dalton’s sojourn among us terminated. He died on the 27th of July,
1844, aged 78.</p>
<p>His fellow-townsmen, the inhabitants of Manchester, who had so long
taken a pride in his residence among them, soon after his death came
to a determination to perpetuate his memory by establishing in his
honor a Professor of Chemistry at Manchester.]</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>The Theory of
Volumes.&#8212;Gay-Lussac.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> atomic theory, at the
very epoch of its introduction into France, received a modification in
virtue of a curious discovery then made. Soon after the publication of
Dalton’s system, Gay-Lussac and Humboldt found a rule for the
combination of substances, which includes that of Dalton as far as it
goes, but extends to combinations of gases only. This law is the
<i>theory of volumes</i>; namely, that gases unite together <i>by
volume</i> in very simple and definite proportions. Thus water is
composed exactly of 100 measures of oxygen and 200 measures of
hydrogen. And since these simple ratios 1 and 1, 1 and 2, 1 and 3,
alone prevail in such combinations, it may easily be shown that laws
like Dalton’s law of multiple proportions, must obtain in such cases
as he considered.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [M. Schröder, of Mannheim, has endeavored to extend to
solids a law in some degree resembling Gay-Lussac’s law of the volumes
of gases. According to him, the volumes of the chemical equivalents
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page291">291</a></span> of simple
substances and their compounds are as whole numbers.<a
id="fnanchor52-14" href="#note52-14"><span
class="fnanchor">52</span></a> MM. Kopp, Playfair, and Joule have
labored in the same field.]</p>

<p>I cannot now attempt to trace other bearings and developments of
this remarkable discovery. I hasten on to the last generalization of
chemistry; which presents to us chemical forces under a new aspect,
and brings us back to the point from which we departed in commencing
the history of this science.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Epoch of Davy and Faraday.</span></h3>
<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Promulgation of the
Electro-chemical Theory by Davy.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> reader will recollect that
the History of Chemistry, though highly important and instructive in
itself, has been an interruption of the History of Electro-dynamic
Research:&#8212;a necessary interruption, however; for till we became
acquainted with Chemistry in general, we could not follow the course
of Electro-chemistry: we could not estimate its vast yet philosophical
theories, nor even express its simplest facts. We have now to endeavor
to show what has thus been done, and by what steps;&#8212;to give a
fitting view of the Epoch of Davy and Faraday.</p>
<p>This is, doubtless, a task of difficulty and delicacy. We cannot
execute it at all, except we suppose that the great truths, of which
the discovery marks this epoch, have already assumed their definite
and permanent form. For we do not learn the just value and right place
of imperfect attempts and partial advances in science, except by
seeing to what they lead. We judge properly of our trials and guesses
only when we have gained our point and guessed rightly. We might
personify philosophical theories, and might represent them to
ourselves as figures, all pressing eagerly onwards in the same <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page292">292</a></span> direction, whom we
have to pursue: and it is only in proportion as we ourselves overtake
those figures in the race, and pass beyond them, that we are enabled
to look back upon their faces; to discern their real aspects, and to
catch the true character of their countenances. Except, therefore, I
were of opinion that the great truths which Davy brought into sight
have been firmly established and clearly developed by Faraday, I could
not pretend to give the history of this striking portion of science.
But I trust, by the view I have to offer of these beautiful trains of
research and their result, to justify the assumption on which I thus
proceed.</p>
<p>I must, however, state, as a further appeal to the reader’s
indulgence, that, even if the great principles of electro-chemistry
have now been brought out in their due form and extent, the discovery
is but a very few years, I might rather say a few months, old, and
that this novelty adds materially to the difficulty of estimating
previous attempts from the point of view to which we are thus led. It
is only slowly and by degrees that the mind becomes sufficiently
imbued with those new truths, of which the office is, to change the
face of a science. We have to consider familiar appearances under a
new aspect; to refer old facts to new principles; and it is not till
after some time, that the struggle and hesitation which this
employment occasions, subsides into a tranquil equilibrium. In the
newly acquired provinces of man’s intellectual empire, the din and
confusion of conquest pass only gradually into quiet and security. We
have seen, in the history of all capital discoveries, how hardly they
have made their way, even among the most intelligent and candid
philosophers of the antecedent schools: we must, therefore, not expect
that the metamorphosis of the theoretical views of chemistry which is
now going on, will be effected without some trouble and delay.</p>
<p>I shall endeavor to diminish the difficulties of my undertaking, by
presenting the earlier investigations in the department of which I
have now to speak, as much as possible according to the most
deliberate view taken of them by the great discoverers themselves,
Davy and Faraday; since these philosophers are they who have taught us
the true import of such investigations.</p>
<p>There is a further difficulty in my task, to which I might
refer;&#8212;the difficulty of speaking, without error and without
offence, of men now alive, or who were lately members of social
circles which exist still around us. But the scientific history in
which such persons play a part, is so important to my purpose, that I
do not hesitate to incur <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page293">293</a></span> the responsibility which the narration
involves; and I have endeavored earnestly, and I hope not in vain, to
speak as if I were removed by centuries from the personages of my
story.</p>
<p>The phenomena observed in the Voltaic apparatus were naturally the
subject of many speculations as to their cause, and thus gave rise to
“Theories of the Pile.” Among these phenomena there was one class
which led to most important results: it was discovered by Nicholson
and Carlisle, in 1800, that water was <em>decomposed</em> by the pile
of Volta; that is, it was found that when the wires of the pile were
placed with their ends near each other in the fluid, a stream of
bubbles of air arose from each wire, and these airs were found on
examination to be oxygen and hydrogen: which, as we have had to
narrate, had already been found to be the constituents of water. This
was, as Davy says,<a id="fnanchor53-14" href="#note53-14"><span
class="fnanchor">53</span></a> the true origin of all that has been
done in electro-chemical science. It was found that other substances
also suffered a like decomposition under the same circumstances.
Certain metallic solutions were decomposed, and an alkali was
separated on the negative plates of the apparatus. Cruickshank, in
pursuing these experiments, added to them many important new results;
such as the decomposition of muriates of magnesia, soda, and ammonia
by the pile; and the general observation that the alkaline matter
always appeared at the <em>negative</em>, and the acid at the
<em>positive</em>, pole.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note53-14"
href="#fnanchor53-14">53</a></span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1826, p.
386.</div>
<p>Such was the state of the subject when one who was destined to do
so much for its advance, first contributed his labors to it. Humphry
Davy was a young man who had been apprenticed to a surgeon at
Penzance, and having shown an ardent love and a strong aptitude for
chemical research, was, in 1798, made the superintendent of a
“Pneumatic Institution,” established at Bristol by Dr. Beddoes, for
the purpose of discovering medical powers of factitious airs.<a
id="fnanchor54-14" href="#note54-14"><span
class="fnanchor">54</span></a> But his main attention was soon drawn
to galvanism; and when, in consequence of the reputation he had
acquired, he was, in 1801, appointed lecturer at the Royal Institution
in London (then recently established), he was soon put in possession
of a galvanic apparatus of great power; and with this he was not long
in obtaining the most striking results.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note54-14"
href="#fnanchor54-14">54</a></span> Paris, <i>Life of Davy</i>, i.
58.</div>
<p>His first paper on the subject<a id="fnanchor55-14"
href="#note55-14"><span class="fnanchor">55</span></a> is sent from
Bristol, in September, 1800; and describes experiments, in which he
had found that the decompositions observed by Nicholson and Carlisle
go on, although the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page294">294</a></span> water, or other substance in which the
two wires are plunged, be separated into two portions, provided these
portions are connected by muscular or other fibres. This use of
muscular fibres was, probably, a remnant of the original disposition,
or accident, by which galvanism had been connected with physiology, as
much as with chemistry. Davy, however, soon went on towards the
conclusion, that the phenomena were altogether chemical in their
nature. He had already conjectured,<a id="fnanchor56-14"
href="#note56-14"><span class="fnanchor">56</span></a> in 1802, that
all decompositions might be <i>polar</i>; that is, that in all cases
of chemical decomposition, the elements might be related to each other
as electrically <i>positive</i> and <i>negative</i>; a thought which
it was the peculiar glory of his school to confirm and place in a
distinct light. At this period such a view was far from obvious; and
it was contended by many, on the contrary, that the elements which the
voltaic apparatus brought to view, were not liberated from
combinations, but generated. In 1806, Davy attempted the solution of
this question; he showed that the ingredients which had been supposed
to be produced by electricity, were due to impurities in the water, or
to the decomposition of the vessel; and thus removed all preliminary
difficulties. And then he says,<a id="fnanchor57-14"
href="#note57-14"><span class="fnanchor">57</span></a> “referring to
my experiments of 1800, 1801, and 1802, and to a number of new facts,
which showed that inflammable substances and oxygen, alkalies and
acids, and oxidable and noble metals, were in electrical relations of
positive and negative, I drew the conclusion, <em>that the
combinations and decompositions by electricity were referrible to the
law of electrical attractions and repulsions</em>,” and advanced the
hypothesis, “<em>that chemical and electrical attractions were
produced by the same cause, acting in the one case on particles, in
the other on masses; . . . and that the same property, under different
modifications, was the cause of all the phenomena exhibited by
different voltaic combinations.</em>”</p>

<p>Although this is the enunciation, in tolerably precise terms, of
the great discovery of his epoch, it was, at the period of which we
speak, conjectured rather than proved; and we shall find that neither
Davy nor his followers, for a considerable period, apprehended it with
that distinctness which makes a discovery complete. But in a very
short time afterwards, Davy drew great additional notice to his
researches by effecting, in pursuance, as it appeared, of his
theoretical views, the decomposition of potassa into a metallic base
and oxygen. This was, as he truly said, in the memorandum written in
his journal at the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page295">295</a></span> instant, “a capital experiment.” This
discovery was soon followed by that of the decomposition of soda; and
shortly after, of other bodies of the same kind; and the interest and
activity of the whole chemical world were turned to the subject in an
intense degree.</p>
<p>At this period, there might be noticed three great branches of
speculation on this subject; <i>the theory of the pile</i>, <i>the
theory of electrical decomposition</i>, and <span class="correction"
title="not in italics in text"><i>the</i></span> <i>theory of the
identity of chemical and electrical forces</i>; which last doctrine,
however, was found to include the other two, as might have been
anticipated from the time of its first suggestion.</p>
<p>It will not be necessary to say much on the theories of the voltaic
pile, as separate from other parts of the subject. The
<i>contact-theory</i>, which ascribed the action to the contact of
different metals, was maintained by Volta himself; but gradually
disappeared, as it was proved (by Wollaston<a id="fnanchor58-14"
href="#note58-14"><span class="fnanchor">58</span></a> especially,)
that the effect of the pile was inseparably connected with oxidation
or other chemical changes. The theories of electro-chemical
decomposition were numerous, and especially after the promulgation of
Davy’s <i>Memoir</i> in 1806; and, whatever might be the defects under
which these speculations for a long time labored, the subject was
powerfully urged on in the direction in which truth lay, by Davy’s
discoveries and views. That there remained something still to be done,
in order to give full evidence and consistency to the theory, appears
from this;&#8212;that some of the most important parts of Davy’s
results struck his followers as extraordinary paradoxes;&#8212;for
instance, the fact that the decomposed elements are transferred from
one part of the circuit to another, in a form which escapes the
cognizance of our senses, through intervening substances for which
they have a strong affinity. It was found afterwards that the
circumstance which appeared to make the process so wonderful, was, in
fact, the condition of its going on at all. Davy’s expressions often
seem to indicate the most exact notions: for instance, he says, “It is
very natural to suppose that the repellent and attractive energies are
communicated from one particle to another of the same kind, so as to
establish a conducting <em>chain</em> in the fluid; and that the
locomotion takes place in consequence;”<a id="fnanchor59-14"
href="#note59-14"><span class="fnanchor">59</span></a> and yet at
other times he speaks of the element as <em>attracted</em> and
<em>repelled</em> by the metallic surfaces which form the
<em>poles</em>;&#8212;a different, and, as it appeared afterwards, an
untenable view. Mr. Faraday, who supplied what was wanting, justly
notices this vagueness. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page296">296</a></span> He says,<a id="fnanchor60-14"
href="#note60-14"><span class="fnanchor">60</span></a> that though, in
Davy’s celebrated Memoir of 1806, the points established are of the
utmost value, the mode of action by which the effects take place is
stated very generally; so generally, indeed, that probably a dozen
precise schemes of electro-chemical action might be drawn up,
differing essentially from each other, yet all agreeing with the
statement there given.” And at a period a little later, being
reproached by Davy’s brother with injustice in this expression, he
substantiated his assertion by an enumeration of twelve such schemes
which had been published.</p>

<p>But yet we cannot look upon this Memoir of 1806, otherwise than as
a great event, perhaps the most important event of the epoch now under
review. And as such it was recognized at once all over Europe. In
particular, it received the distinguished honor of being crowned by
the Institute of France, although that country and England were then
engaged in fierce hostility. Buonaparte had proposed a prize of sixty
thousand francs “to the person who by his experiments and discoveries
should advance the knowledge of electricity and galvanism, as much as
Franklin and Volta did;” and “of three thousand francs for the best
experiment which should be made in the course of each year on the
galvanic fluid;” the latter prize was, by the First Class of the
Institute, awarded to Davy.</p>
<p>From this period he rose rapidly to honors and distinctions, and
reached a height of scientific fame as great as has ever fallen to the
lot of a discoverer in so short a time. I shall not, however, dwell on
such circumstances, but confine myself to the progress of my
subject.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Establishment of the Electro-chemical
Theory by Faraday.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> defects of Davy’s
theoretical views will be seen most clearly by explaining what Faraday
added to them. Michael Faraday was in every way fitted and led to
become Davy’s successor in his great career of discovery. In 1812,
being then a bookseller’s apprentice, he attended the lectures of
Davy, which at that period excited the highest admiration.<a
id="fnanchor61-14" href="#note61-14"><span
class="fnanchor">61</span></a> “My desire to escape from trade,” Mr.
Faraday says, “which I thought vicious and selfish, and to enter into
the service of science, which I imagined made its pursuers amiable and
liberal, induced me at last to take the bold and simple step of
writing to Sir H. Davy.” He was favorably received, and, in the next
year, became <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page297">297</a></span>
Davy’s assistant at the Institution; and afterwards his successor. The
Institution which produced such researches as those of these two men,
may well be considered as a great school of exact and philosophical
chemistry. Mr. Faraday, from the beginning of his course of inquiry,
appears to have had the consciousness that he was engaged on a great
connected work. His <i>Experimental Researches</i>, which appeared in
a series of Memoirs in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>, are
divided into short paragraphs, numbered into a continued order from 1
up to 1160, at the time at which I write;<a id="fnanchor62-14"
href="#note62-14"><span class="fnanchor">62</span></a> and destined,
probably, to extend much further. These paragraphs are connected by a
very rigorous method of investigation and reasoning which runs through
the whole body of them. Yet this unity of purpose was not at first
obvious. His first two Memoirs were upon subjects which we have
already treated of (B. xiii. <a href="#v2page245">c. 5</a> and <a
href="#b13-8">c. 8</a>), Voltaic Induction, and the evolution of
Electricity from Magnetism. His “Third Series” has also been <a
href="#fnanchor36-13">already</a> referred to. Its object was, as a
preparatory step towards further investigation, to show the identity
of voltaic and animal electricity with that of the electrical machine;
and as machine electricity differs from other kinds in being
successively in a state of tension and explosion, instead of a
continued current, Mr. Faraday succeeded in identifying it with them,
by causing the electrical discharge to pass through a bad conductor
into a discharging-train of vast extent; nothing less, indeed, than
the whole fabric of the metallic gas-pipes and water-pipes of London.
In this Memoir<a id="fnanchor63-14" href="#note63-14"><span
class="fnanchor">63</span></a> it is easy to see already traces of the
general theoretical views at which he had arrived; but these are not
expressly stated till his “Fifth Series;” his intermediate Fourth
Series being occupied by another subsidiary labor on the conditions of
conduction. At length, however, in the Fifth Series, which was read to
the Royal Society in June, 1833, he approaches the theory of
electro-chemical decomposition. Most preceding theorists, and Davy
amongst the number, had referred this result to <em>attractive
powers</em> residing in the <em>poles</em> of the apparatus; and had
even pretended to compare the intensity of this attraction at
different distances from the poles. By a number of singularly
beautiful and skilful experiments, Mr. Faraday shows that the
phenomena can with no propriety be <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page298">298</a></span> ascribed to the attraction of the
poles.<a id="fnanchor64-14" href="#note64-14"><span
class="fnanchor">64</span></a> “As the substances evolved in cases of
electro-chemical decomposition may be made to appear against air,<a
id="fnanchor65-14" href="#note65-14"><span
class="fnanchor">65</span></a> which, according to common language, is
not a conductor, nor is decomposed; or against water,<a
id="fnanchor66-14" href="#note66-14"><span
class="fnanchor">66</span></a> which is a conductor, and can be
decomposed; as well as against the metal poles, which are excellent
conductors, but undecomposable; there appears but little reason to
consider this phenomenon generally as due to the attraction or
attractive powers of the latter, when used in the ordinary way, since
similar attractions can hardly be imagined in the former
instances.”</p>

<p>Faraday’s opinion, and, indeed, the only way of expressing the
results of his experiments, was, that the chemical elements, in
obedience to the direction of the voltaic currents established in the
decomposing substance, were evolved, or, as he prefers to say,
<em>ejected</em> at its extremities.<a id="fnanchor67-14"
href="#note67-14"><span class="fnanchor">67</span></a> He afterwards
states that the influence which is present in the electric current may
be described<a id="fnanchor68-14" href="#note68-14"><span
class="fnanchor">68</span></a> as <em>an axis of power, having</em>
[at each point] <em>contrary forces exactly equal in amount in
contrary directions</em>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note67-14"

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note68-14"
href="#fnanchor68-14">68</a></span> 517.</div>
<p>Having arrived at this point, Faraday rightly wished to reject the
term <i>poles</i>, and other words which could hardly be used without
suggesting doctrines now proved to be erroneous. He considered, in the
case of bodies electrically decomposed, or, as he termed them,
<i>electrolytes</i>, the elements as travelling in two opposite
directions; which, with reference to the direction of terrestrial
magnetism, might be considered as naturally east and west; and he
conceived elements as, in this way, arriving at the doors or outlets
at which they finally made their separate appearance. The doors he
called <i>electrodes</i>, and, separately, the <i>anode</i> and the
<i>cathode</i>;<a id="fnanchor69-14" href="#note69-14"><span
class="fnanchor">69</span></a> and the elements which thus travel he
termed the <i>anïon</i> and the <i>catïon</i> (or <i>cathïon</i>).<a
id="fnanchor70-14" href="#note70-14"><span
class="fnanchor">70</span></a> By means of this nomenclature he was
able to express his general results with much more distinctness and
facility.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note69-14"
href="#fnanchor69-14">69</a></span> 663.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note70-14"
href="#fnanchor70-14">70</a></span> The analogy of the Greek
derivation requires <i>catïon</i>; but to make the relation to
<i>cathode</i> obvious to the English reader, and to avoid a violation
of the habits of English pronunciation, I should prefer
<i>cathïon</i>.</div>
<p>But this general view of the electrolytical process required to be
pursued further, in order to explain the nature of the action. The
identity of electrical and chemical forces, which had been hazarded as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page299">299</a></span> a conjecture by
Davy, and adopted as the basis of chemistry by Berzelius, could only
be established by exact measures and rigorous proofs. Faraday had, in
his proof of the identity of voltaic and electric agency, attempted
also to devise such a measure as should give him a comparison of their
quantity; and in this way he proved that<a id="fnanchor71-14"
href="#note71-14"><span class="fnanchor">71</span></a> a voltaic group
of two small wires of platinum and zinc, placed near each other, and
immersed in dilute acid for three seconds, yields as much electricity
as the electrical battery, charged by ten turns of a large machine;
and this was established both by its momentary electro-magnetic
effect, and by the amount of its chemical action.<a id="fnanchor72-14"
href="#note72-14"><span class="fnanchor">72</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note71-14"
href="#fnanchor71-14">71</a></span> <i>Researches</i>, Art. 371.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note72-14"
href="#fnanchor72-14">72</a></span> 537.</div>
<p>It was in his “Seventh Series,” that he finally established a
principle of definite measurement of the amount of electrolytical
action, and described an instrument which he termed<a
id="fnanchor73-14" href="#note73-14"><span
class="fnanchor">73</span></a> a <i>volta-electrometer</i>. In this
instrument the amount of action was measured by the quantity of water
decomposed: and it was necessary, in order to give validity to the
mensuration, to show (as Faraday did show) that neither the size of
the electrodes, nor the intensity of the current, nor the strength of
the acid solution which acted on the plates of the pile, disturbed the
accuracy of this measure. He proved, by experiments upon a great
variety of substances, of the most different kinds, that the
electro-chemical action is definite in amount according to the
measurement of the new instrument.<a id="fnanchor74-14"
href="#note74-14"><span class="fnanchor">74</span></a> He had already,
at an earlier period,<a id="fnanchor75-14" href="#note75-14"><span
class="fnanchor">75</span></a> asserted, that <em>the chemical power
of a current of electricity is in direct proportion to the absolute
quantity of electricity which passes</em>; but the volta-electrometer
enabled him to fix with more precision the meaning of this general
proposition, as well as to place it beyond doubt.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note73-14"
href="#fnanchor73-14">73</a></span> 739.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note74-14"

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note75-14"
href="#fnanchor75-14">75</a></span> 377.</div>
<p>The vast importance of this step in chemistry soon came into view.
By the use of the volta-electrometer, Faraday obtained, for each
elementary substance, a number which represented the relative amount
of its decomposition, and which might properly<a id="fnanchor76-14"
href="#note76-14"><span class="fnanchor">76</span></a> be called its
“electro-chemical equivalent.” And the question naturally occurs,
whether these numbers bore any relation to any previously established
chemical measures. The answer is remarkable. <em>They were no other
than the atomic weights of the Daltonian theory</em>, which formed the
climax of the previous ascent of chemistry; and thus here, as
everywhere in <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page300">300</a></span>
the progress of science, the generalizations of one generation are
absorbed in the wider generalizations of the next.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note76-14"
href="#fnanchor76-14">76</a></span> 792.</div>
<p>But in order to reach securely this wider generalization, Faraday
combined the two branches of the subject which we have already
noticed;&#8212;the <i>theory of electrical decomposition</i> with the
<i>theory of the pile</i>. For his researches on the origin of
activity of the voltaic circuit (his Eighth Series), led him to see
more clearly than any one before him, what, as we have said, the most
sagacious of preceding philosophers had maintained, that the current
in the pile was due to the mutual chemical action of its elements. He
was led to consider the processes which go on in the
<i>exciting-cell</i> and in the decomposing place as of the same kind,
but opposite in direction. The chemical <em>composition</em> of the
fluid with the zinc, in the common apparatus, produces, when the
circuit is completed, a current of electric influence in the wire; and
this current, if it pass through an electrolyte, manifests itself by
<em>decomposition</em>, overcoming the chemical affinity which there
resists it. An electrolyte cannot conduct without being decomposed.
The forces at the point of composition and the point of decomposition
are of the same kind, and are opposed to each other by means of the
conducting-wire; the wire may properly be spoken of<a
id="fnanchor77-14" href="#note77-14"><span
class="fnanchor">77</span></a> as <i>conducting chemical affinity</i>:
it allows two forces of the same kind to oppose one another;<a
id="fnanchor78-14" href="#note78-14"><span
class="fnanchor">78</span></a> electricity is only another mode of the
exertion of chemical forces;<a id="fnanchor79-14"
href="#note79-14"><span class="fnanchor">79</span></a> and we might
express all the circumstances of the voltaic pile without using any
other term than chemical affinity, though that of electricity may be
very convenient.<a id="fnanchor80-14" href="#note80-14"><span
class="fnanchor">80</span></a> Bodies are held together by a definite
power, which, when it ceases to discharge that office, may be thrown
into the condition of an electric current.<a id="fnanchor81-14"

<p>Thus the great principle of the identity of electrical and chemical
action was completely established. It was, as Faraday with great
candor says,<a id="fnanchor82-14" href="#note82-14"><span
class="fnanchor">82</span></a> a confirmation of the general views put
forth by Davy, in 1806, and might be expressed in his terms, that
“chemical and electrical attractions are produced by the same cause;”
but it is easy to see that neither was the full import of these
expressions understood nor were the quantities to which they refer
conceived as measurable quantities, nor was the assertion anything but
a sagacious conjecture, till Faraday gave the interpretation, measure,
and proof, of which we have spoken. The evidence of the incompleteness
of the views of his predecessor we have <a
href="#v2page294">already</a> adduced, in speaking of his vague and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page301">301</a></span> inconsistent
theoretical account of decomposition. The confirmation of Davy’s
discoveries by Faraday is of the nature of Newton’s confirmation of
the views of Borelli and Hooke respecting gravity, or like Young’s
confirmation of the undulatory theory of Huyghens.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note82-14"
href="#fnanchor82-14">82</a></span> 965.</div>
<p>We must not omit to repeat here the moral which we wish to draw
from all great discoveries, that they depend upon the combination of
<em>exact facts</em> with <em>clear ideas</em>. The former of these
conditions is easily illustrated in the case of Davy and Faraday, both
admirable and delicate experimenters. Davy’s rapidity and resource in
experimenting were extraordinary,<a id="fnanchor83-14"
href="#note83-14"><span class="fnanchor">83</span></a> and extreme
elegance and ingenuity distinguish almost every process of Faraday. He
had published, in 1829, a work on <i>Chemical Manipulation</i>, in
which directions are given for performing in the neatest manner all
chemical processes. Manipulation, as he there truly says, is to the
chemist like the external senses to the mind;<a id="fnanchor84-14"
href="#note84-14"><span class="fnanchor">84</span></a> and without the
supply of fit materials which such senses only can give, the mind can
acquire no real knowledge.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note83-14"
href="#fnanchor83-14">83</a></span> Paris, i. 145.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note84-14"
href="#fnanchor84-14">84</a></span> <i>Pref.</i> p. ii.</div>
<p>But still the operations of the mind as well as the information of
the senses, ideas as well as facts, are requisite for the attainment
of any knowledge; and all great steps in science require a peculiar
distinctness and vividness of thought in the discoverer. This it is
difficult to exemplify in any better way than by the discoveries
themselves. Both Davy and Faraday possessed this vividness of mind;
and it was a consequence of this endowment, that Davy’s <span
class="correction" title="emended from lecture">lectures</span> upon
chemistry, and Faraday’s upon almost any subject of physical
philosophy, were of the most brilliant and captivating character. In
discovering the nature of voltaic action, the essential intellectual
requisite was to have a distinct conception of that which Faraday
expressed by the remarkable phrase,<a id="fnanchor85-14"
href="#note85-14"><span class="fnanchor">85</span></a> “<i>an axis of
power having equal and opposite forces</i>;” and the distinctness of
this idea in Faraday’s mind shines forth in every part of his
writings. Thus he says, the force which determines the decomposition
of a body is <em>in</em> the body, not in the poles.<a
id="fnanchor86-14" href="#note86-14"><span
class="fnanchor">86</span></a> But for the most part he can of course
only convey this fundamental idea by illustrations. Thus<a
id="fnanchor87-14" href="#note87-14"><span
class="fnanchor">87</span></a> he represents the voltaic circuit by a
double circle, studded with the elements of the circuit, and shows how
the <em>anïons</em> travel round it in one direction, and the
<em>cathïons</em> in the opposite. He considers<a id="fnanchor88-14"
href="#note88-14"><span class="fnanchor">88</span></a> the powers at
the two places of action as balancing against each other through the
medium of the conductors, in a manner <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page302">302</a></span> analogous to that in which mechanical
forces are balanced against each other by the intervention of the
lever. It is impossible to him<a id="fnanchor89-14"
href="#note89-14"><span class="fnanchor">89</span></a> to resist the
idea, that the voltaic current must be preceded by a state of tension
in its interrupted condition, which is relieved when the circuit is
completed. He appears to possess the idea of this kind of force with
the same eminent distinctness with which Archimedes in the ancient,
and Stevinus in the modern history of science, possessed the idea of
pressure, and were thus able to found the science of mechanics.<a
id="fnanchor90-14" href="#note90-14"><span
class="fnanchor">90</span></a> And when he cannot obtain these
distinct modes of conception, he is dissatisfied, and conscious of
defect. Thus in the relation between magnetism and electricity,<a
id="fnanchor91-14" href="#note91-14"><span
class="fnanchor">91</span></a> “there appears to be a link in the
chain of effects, a wheel in the physical mechanism of the action, as
yet unrecognized.” All this variety of expression shows how deeply
seated is the thought. This conception of Chemical Affinity as a
peculiar influence of force, which, acting in opposite directions,
combines and resolves bodies;&#8212;which may be liberated and thrown
into the form of a voltaic current, and thus be transferred to remote
points, and applied in various ways; is essential to the
understanding, as it was to the making, of these discoveries.</p>

<p>By those to whom this conception has been conveyed, I venture to
trust that I shall be held to have given a faithful account of this
important event in the history of science. We may, before we quit the
subject, notice one or two of the remarkable subordinate features of
Faraday’s discoveries.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Consequences of Faraday’s
Discoveries.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Faraday’s</span> volta-electrometer,
in conjunction with the method he had already employed, as we have
seen, for the comparison of voltaic and common electricity, enabled
him to measure the actual quantity of electricity which is exhibited,
in given cases, in the form of chemical affinity. His results appeared
in numbers of that enormous amount which so often comes before us in
the expression of natural laws. One grain of water<a
id="fnanchor92-14" href="#note92-14"><span
class="fnanchor">92</span></a> will require for its decomposition as
much electricity as would make a powerful flash of lightning. By
further calculation, he finds this quantity to be not less than
800,000 charges of his Leyden battery;<a id="fnanchor93-14"
href="#note93-14"><span class="fnanchor">93</span></a> and this is, by
his theory of the identity of the combining with the decomposing
force, the quantity of electricity <span class="pagenum"><a

elements of the grain of water, endowing them with their mutual

<p>Many of the subordinate facts and laws which were brought to light
by these researches, clearly point to generalizations, not included in
that which we have had to consider, and not yet discovered: such laws
do not properly belong to our main plan, which is to make our way
<em>up to</em> the generalizations. But there is one which so
evidently promises to have an important bearing on future chemical
theories, that I will briefly mention it. The class of bodies which
are capable of electrical decomposition is limited by a very
remarkable law: they are such binary compounds only as consist of
<em>single</em> proportionals of their elementary principles. It does
not belong to us here to speculate on the possible import of this
curious law; which, if not fully established, Faraday has rendered, at
least, highly probable:<a id="fnanchor94-14" href="#note94-14"><span
class="fnanchor">94</span></a> but it is impossible not to see how
closely it connects the Atomic with the Electro-chemical Theory; and
in the connexion of these two great members of Chemistry, is involved
the prospect of its reaching wider generalizations, and principles
more profound than we have yet caught sight of.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note94-14"
href="#fnanchor94-14">94</a></span> Art. 697.</div>
<p>As another example of this connexion, I will, finally, notice that
Faraday has employed his discoveries in order to decide, in some
doubtful cases, what is the true chemical equivalent;<a
id="fnanchor95-14" href="#note95-14"><span
class="fnanchor">95</span></a> “I have such conviction,” he says,
“that the power which governs electro-decomposition and ordinary
chemical attractions is the same; and such confidence in the
overruling influence of those natural laws which render the former
definite, as to feel no hesitation in believing that the latter must
submit to them too. Such being the case, I can have no doubt that,
assuming hydrogen as 1, and dismissing small fractions for the
simplicity of expression, the equivalent number or atomic weight of
oxygen is 8, of chlorine 36, of bromine 78·4, of lead 103·5, of tin
59, &amp;c.; notwithstanding that a very high authority doubles
several of these numbers.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note95-14"

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 4.&#8212;<i>Reception of the Electro-chemical
Theory.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> epoch of establishment of
the electro-chemical theory, like other great scientific epochs, must
have its sequel, the period of its reception and confirmation,
application and extension. In that period we <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page304">304</a></span> are living, and it must be the task of
future historians to trace its course.</p>
<p>We may, however, say a word on the reception which the theory met
with, in the forms which it assumed, anterior to the labors of
Faraday. Even before the great discovery of Davy, Grotthuss, in 1805,
had written upon the theory of electro-chemical decomposition; but he
and, as we have seen, Davy, and afterwards other writers, as Riffault
and Chompré, in 1807, referred the effects to the poles.<a
id="fnanchor96-14" href="#note96-14"><span
class="fnanchor">96</span></a> But the most important attempt to
appropriate and employ the generalization which these discoveries
suggested, was that of Berzelius; who adopted at once the view of the
identity, or at least the universal connexion, of electrical relations
with chemical affinity. He considered,<a id="fnanchor97-14"
href="#note97-14"><span class="fnanchor">97</span></a> that in all
chemical combinations the elements may be considered as
electro-positive and electro-negative; and made this opposition the
basis of his chemical doctrines; in which he was followed by a large
body of the chemists of Germany. He held too that the heat and light,
evolved during cases of powerful combination, are the consequence of
the electric discharge which is at that moment taking place: a
conjecture which Faraday at first spoke of with praise.<a
id="fnanchor98-14" href="#note98-14"><span
class="fnanchor">98</span></a> But at a later period he more sagely
says,<a id="fnanchor99-14" href="#note99-14"><span
class="fnanchor">99</span></a> that the flame which is produced in
such cases exhibits but a small portion of the electric power which
really acts. “These therefore may not, cannot, be taken as evidences
of the nature of the action; but are merely incidental results,
incomparably small in relation to the forces concerned, and supplying
no information of the way in which the particles are active on each
other, or in which their forces are finally arranged.” And comparing
the evidence which he himself had given of the principle on which
Berzelius’s speculations rested, with the speculations themselves,
Faraday justly conceived, that he had transferred the doctrine from
the domain of what he calls <i>doubtful knowledge</i>, to that of
inductive certainty.</p>

<p>Now that we are arrived at the starting-place, from which this
well-proved truth, the identity of electric and chemical forces, must
make its future advances, it would be trifling to dwell longer on the
details of the diffusion of that doubtful knowledge which preceded
this more certain science. Our history of chemistry is, therefore,
here at an end. I have, as far as I could, executed my task; which
was, to mark all the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page305">305</a></span> great steps of its advance, from the
most unconnected facts and the most imperfect speculations, to the
highest generalization at which chemical philosophers have yet
arrived.</p>
<p>Yet it will appear to our purpose to say a few words on the
connexion of this science with those of which we are next to treat;
and that I now proceed to do.</p>
<hr class="three space-above" />
<h3>CHAPTER X.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Transition from the Chemical to the Classificatory
Sciences.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IT</span> is the object and the boast
of chemistry to acquire a knowledge of bodies which is more exact and
constant than any knowledge borrowed from their sensible qualities can
be; since it penetrates into their intimate constitution, and
discloses to us the invariable laws of their composition. But yet it
will be seen, on a little reflection, that such knowledge could not
have any existence, if we were not also attentive to their sensible
qualities.</p>
<p>The whole fabric of chemistry rests, even at the present day, upon
the opposition of acids and bases: an acid was certainly at first
known by its sensible qualities, and how otherwise, even now, do we
perceive its quality? It was a great discovery of modern times that
earths and alkalies have for their bases metals: but what are
<em>metals</em>? or how, except from lustre, hardness, weight, and the
like, do we recognize a body as a metal? And how, except by such
characters, even before its analysis, was it known to be an earth or
an alkali? We must suppose some classification established, before we
can make any advance by experiment or observation.</p>
<p>It is easy to see that all attempts to avoid this difficulty by
referring to processes and analogies, as well as to substances, bring
us back to the same point in a circle of fallacies. If we say that an
acid and alkali are known by combining with each other, we still must
ask, What is the criterion that they have <em>combined</em>? If we say
that the distinctive qualities of metals and earths are, that metals
become earths by oxidation, we must still inquire how we recognize the
process of <em>oxidation</em>? We have seen how important a part
combustion plays in the history of chemical speculation; and we may
usefully form such classes of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page306">306</a></span> bodies as <i>combustibles</i> and
<i>supporters of combustion</i>. But even <em>combustion</em> is not
capable of being infallibly known, for it passes by insensible shades
into oxidation. We can find no basis for our reasonings, which does
not assume a classification of obvious facts and qualities.</p>
<p>But any classification of substances on such grounds, appears, at
first sight, to involve us in vagueness, ambiguity, and contradiction.
Do we really take the sensible qualities of an acid as the criterion
of its being an acid?&#8212;for instance, its sourness? Prussic acid,
arsenious acid, are not sour. “I remember,” says Dr. Paris,<a
id="fnanchor100-14" href="#note100-14"><span
class="fnanchor">100</span></a> “a chemist having been exposed to much
ridicule from speaking of a <em>sweet</em> acid,&#8212;why not?” When
Davy had discovered potassium, it was disputed whether it was a metal;
for though its lustre and texture are metallic, it is so light as to
swim on water. And if potassium be allowed to be a metal, is silicium
one, a body which wants the metallic lustre, and is a non-conductor of
electricity? It is clear that, at least, the <em>obvious</em>
application of a classification by physical characters, is attended
with endless perplexity.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note100-14"
href="#fnanchor100-14">100</a></span> <i>Life of Davy</i>, i.
263.</div>
<p>But since we cannot even begin our researches without assuming a
classification, and since the forms of such a classification which
first occur, end in apparent confusion, it is clear that we must look
to our philosophy for a solution of this difficulty; and must avoid
the embarrassments and contradictions of casual and unreflective
classification, by obtaining a consistent and philosophical
arrangement. We must employ external characters and analogies in a
connected and systematic manner; we must have <i>Classificatory
Sciences</i>, and these must have a bearing even on Chemistry.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the most philosophical chemists now proceed upon this
principle. “The method which I have followed,” says M. Thenard, in his
<i>Traité de Chimie</i>, published in 1824, “is, to unite in one group
all analogous bodies; and the advantage of this method, which is that
employed by naturalists, is very great, especially in the study of the
metals and their compounds.”<a id="fnanchor101-14"
href="#note101-14"><span class="fnanchor">101</span></a> In this, as
in all good systems of chemistry, which have appeared since the
establishment of the phlogistic theory, combustion, and the analogous
processes, are one great element in the arrangement, while the
difference of metallic and non-metallic, is another element. Thus
Thenard, in the first place, speaks of Oxygen; in the next place, of
the Non-metallic Combustibles, as Hydrogen, Carbon, Sulphur, Chlorine;
and in the next place, of Metals. But the Metals are again divided
into six Sections, with reference, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page307">307</a></span> principally, to their facility of
combination with oxygen. Thus, the First Section is the Metals of the
Earths; the Second, the Metals of the Alkalies; the Third, the Easily
Oxidable Metals, as Iron; the Fourth, Metals Less Oxidable, as Copper
and Lead; the Fifth Section contains only Mercury and Osmium; and the
Sixth, what were at an earlier period termed the <i>Noble</i> Metals,
Gold, Silver, Platinum, and others.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note101-14"
href="#fnanchor101-14">101</a></span> Pref., p. viii.</div>
<p>How such principles are to be applied, so as to produce a definite
and consistent arrangement, will be explained in speaking of the
philosophy of the Classificatory Sciences; but there are one or two
peculiarities in the classes of bodies thus recognized by modern
chemistry, which it may be useful to notice.</p>
<p>1. The distinction of Metallic and Non-metallic is still employed,
as of fundamental importance. The discovery of new metals is so much
connected with the inquiries concerning chemical elements, that we may
notice the general progress of such discoveries. <i>Gold</i>,
<i>Silver</i>, <i>Iron</i>, <i>Copper</i>, <i>Quicksilver</i>,
<i>Lead</i>, <i>Tin</i>, were known from the earliest antiquity. In
the beginning of the sixteenth century, mine-directors, like George
Agricola, had advanced so far in practical metallurgy, that they had
discovered the means of extracting three additional metals,
<i>Zinc</i>, <i>Bismuth</i>, <i>Antimony</i>. After this, there was no
new metal discovered for a century, and then such discoveries were
made by the theoretical chemists, a race of men who had not existed
before Beccher and Stahl. Thus <i>Arsenic</i> and <i>Cobalt</i> were
made known by Brandt, in the middle of the eighteenth century, and we
have a long list of similar discoveries belonging to the same period;
<i>Nickel</i>, <i>Manganese</i>, and <i>Tungsten</i>, which were
detected by Cronstedt, Gahn, and Scheele, and Delhuyart, respectively;
metals of a very different kind, <i>Tellurium</i> and
<i>Molybdenum</i>, which were brought to light by Müller, Scheele,
Bergman, and Hielm; <i>Platinum</i>, which was known as early as 1741,
but with the ore of which, in 1802 and 1803, the English chemists,
Wollaston and Tennant, found that no less than four other new metals
(<i>Palladium</i>, <i>Rhodium</i>, <i>Iridium</i> and <i>Osmium</i>)
were associated. Finally, (omitting some other new metals,) we have
another period of discovery, opened in 1807, by Davy’s discovery of
<i>Potassium</i>, and including the resolution of all, or almost all,
the alkalies and earths into metallic bases.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [The next few years made some, at least some conjectural,
additions to the list of simple substances, detected by a more minute
scrutiny of known substances. <i>Thorium</i> was discovered by
Berzelius in 1828; and <i>Vanadium</i> by Professor Sefström in 1830.
A <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page308">308</a></span> metal named
<i>Cerium</i>, was discovered in 1803, by Hisinger and Berzelius, in a
rare Swedish mineral known by the name of Cerit. Mosander more
recently has found combined with Cerium, other new metals which he has
called <i>Lanthanium</i>, <i>Didymium</i>, <i>Erbium</i>, and
<i>Terbium</i>: M. Klaus has found a new metal, <i>Ruthenium</i>, in
the ore of Platinum; and Rose has discovered in Tantalite two other
new metals, which he has announced under the names of <i>Pelopium</i>
and <i>Niobium</i>. Svanberg is said to have discovered a new earth in
Eudialyt, which is supposed to have, like the rest, a new radical. If
these last discoveries be confirmed, the number of simple substances
will be raised to <em>sixty-two</em>.]</p>
<p>2. Attempts have been made to indicate the classification of
chemical substances by some peculiarity in the Name; and the Metals,
for example, have been designated generally by names in <i>um</i>,
like the Latin names of the ancient metals, <i>aurum</i>,
<i>ferrum</i>. This artifice is a convenient nomenclature for the
purpose of marking a recognized difference; and it would be worth the
while of chemists to agree to make it universal, by writing
molybden<i>um</i> and platin<i>um</i>; which is sometimes done, but
not always.</p>
<p>3. I am not now to attempt to determine how far this
class,&#8212;Metals,&#8212;extends; but where the analogies of the
class cease to hold there the nomenclature must also change. Thus,
some chemists, as Dr. Thomson, have conceived that the base of Silica
is more analogous to Carbon and Boron, which form acids with oxygen,
than it is to the metals: and he has accordingly associated this base
with these substances, and has given it the same termination,
<i>Silicon</i>. But on the validity of this analogy chemists appear
not to be generally agreed.</p>
<p>4. There is another class of bodies which have attracted much
notice among modern chemists, and which have also been assimilated to
each other in the form of their names; the English writers calling
them <i>Chlorine</i>, <i>Fluorine</i>, <i>Iodine</i>, <i>Bromine</i>,
while the French use the terms <i>Chlore</i>, <i>Phtore</i>,
<i>Iode</i>, <i>Brome</i>. We have already noticed the establishment
of the doctrine&#8212;that muriatic acid is formed of a base,
chlorine, and of hydrogen,&#8212;as a great reform in the oxygen
theory; with regard to which rival claims were advanced by Davy, and
by MM. Gay-Lussac and Thenard in 1800. Iodine, a remarkable body
which, from a dark powder, is converted into a violet-colored gas by
the application of heat, was also, in 1813, the subject of a similar
rivalry between the same English and French chemists. Bromine <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page309">309</a></span> was only discovered
as late as 1826; and Fluorine, or <i>Phtore</i>, as, from its
destructive nature, it has been proposed to term it, has not been
obtained as a separate substance, and is inferred to exist by analogy
only. The analogies of these bodies (Chlore, Phtore, &amp;c.) are very
peculiar; for instance, by combination with metals they form salts; by
combination with hydrogen they form very strong acids; and all, at the
common temperature of the atmosphere, operate on other bodies in the
most energetic manner. Berzelius<a id="fnanchor102-14"
href="#note102-14"><span class="fnanchor">102</span></a> proposes to
call them <i>halogenous</i> bodies, or <i>halogenes</i>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note102-14"
href="#fnanchor102-14">102</a></span> <i>Chem.</i> i. 262.</div>
<p>5. The number of Elementary Substances which are at present
presented in our treatises of chemistry<a id="fnanchor103-14"
href="#note103-14"><span class="fnanchor">103</span></a> is
<em>fifty-three</em>, [or rather, as we have said above,
<em>sixty-two</em>.] It is naturally often asked what evidence we
have, that all these are <em>elementary</em>, and what evidence that
they are <em>all</em> the elementary bodies;&#8212;how we know that
new elements may not hereafter be discovered, or these supposed simple
bodies resolved into simpler still? To these questions we can only
answer, by referring to the history of chemistry;&#8212;by pointing
out what chemists have understood by analysis, according to the
preceding narrative. They have considered, as the analysis of a
substance, that elementary constitution of it which gives the only
intelligible explanation of the results of chemical manipulation, and
which is proved to be complete as to quantity, by the balance, since
the whole can only be equal to all its parts. It is impossible to
maintain that new substances may not hereafter be discovered; for they
may lurk, even in familiar substances, in doses so minute that they
have not yet been missed amid the inevitable slight inaccuracies of
all analysis; in the way in which iodine and bromine remained so long
undetected in sea-water; and new minerals, or old ones not yet
sufficiently examined, can hardly fail to add something to our list.
As to the possibility of a further analysis of our supposed simple
bodies, we may venture to say that, in regard to such supposed simple
bodies as compose a numerous and well-characterized class, no such
step can be made, except through some great change in chemical theory,
which gives us a new view of all the general relations which chemistry
has yet discovered. The proper evidence of the reality of any supposed
new analysis is, that it is more consistent with the known analogies
of chemistry, to suppose the process analytical than synthetical.
Thus, as has already been said, chemists admit the existence of
fluorine, from the analogy of chlorine; and Davy, when it was found
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page310">310</a></span> that ammonia
formed an amalgam with mercury, was tempted to assign to it a metallic
basis. But then he again hesitates,<a id="fnanchor104-14"
href="#note104-14"><span class="fnanchor">104</span></a> and doubts
whether the analogies of our knowledge are not better preserved by
supposing that ammonia, as a compound of hydrogen and another
principle, is “a type of the composition of the metals.”</p>

<p>Our history, which is the history of what we know, has little to do
with such conjectures. There are, however, some not unimportant
principles which bear upon them, and which, as they are usually
employed, belong to the science which next comes under our review,
Mineralogy.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Of the Classificatory
Sciences.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> horizon of the sciences
spreads wider and wider before us, as we advance in our task of taking
a survey of the vast domain. We have seen that the existence of
Chemistry as a science which declares the ingredients and essential
constitution of all kinds of bodies, implies the existence of another
corresponding science, which shall divide bodies into kinds, and point
out steadily and precisely what bodies they are which we have
analysed. But a science thus dividing and defining bodies, is but one
member of an order of sciences, different from those which we have
hitherto described; namely, of the <i>classificatory sciences</i>.
Such sciences there must be, not only having reference to the bodies
with which chemistry deals, but also to all things respecting which we
aspire to obtain any general knowledge, as, for instance, plants and
animals. Indeed it will be found, that it is with regard to these
latter objects, to organized beings, that the process of scientific
classification has been most successfully exercised; while with regard
to inorganic substances, the formation of a satisfactory system of
arrangement has been found extremely difficult; nor has the necessity
of such a system been recognised by chemists so distinctly and
constantly as it ought to be. The best exemplification of these
branches of knowledge, of which we now have to speak, will, therefore,
be found in the organic world, in Botany and Zoology; but we will, in
the first place, take a brief view of the science which classifies
inorganic bodies, and of which Mineralogy is hitherto the very
imperfect representative.</p>
<p>The principles and rules of the Classificatory Sciences, as well as
of those of the other orders of sciences, must be fully explained when
we come to treat of the Philosophy of the Sciences; and cannot be
introduced here, where we have to do with history only. But I may
observe very briefly, that with the process of <i>classing</i>, is
joined the process of <i>naming</i>;&#8212;that names imply
classification;&#8212;and that even the rudest and earliest
application of language presupposes a distribution of objects
according to their kinds;&#8212;but that such a spontaneous <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page314">314</a></span> and unsystematic
distribution cannot, in the cases we now have to consider, answer the
purposes of exact and general knowledge. Our classification of objects
must be made consistent and systematic, in order to be scientific; we
must discover marks and characters, properties and conditions, which
are constant in their occurrence and relations; we must form our
classes, we must impose our names, according to such marks. We can
thus, and thus alone, arrive at that precise, certain, and systematic
knowledge, which we seek; that is, at science. The object, then, of
the classificatory sciences is to obtain <span class="sc">fixed
characters</span> of the kinds of things; and the criterion of the
fitness of names is, that <span class="sc">they make general
propositions possible</span>.</p>
<p>I proceed to review the progress of certain sciences on these
principles, and first, though briefly, the science of Mineralogy.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Mineralogy as the
Analytico-classificatory Science.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Mineralogy</span>, as it has
hitherto been cultivated, is, as I have already said, an imperfect
representative of the department of human knowledge to which it
belongs. The attempts at the science have generally been made by
collecting various kinds of information respecting mineral bodies; but
the science which we require is a complete and consistent classified
system of all inorganic bodies. For chemistry proceeds upon the
principle that the constitution of a body invariably determines its
properties; and, consequently, its kind: but we cannot apply this
principle, except we can speak with precision of the <em>kind</em> of
a body, as well as of its composition. We cannot attach any sense to
the assertion, that “soda or baryta has a metal for its base,” except
we know what <em>a metal</em> is, or at least what properties it
implies. It may not be, indeed it is not, possible, to define the
kinds of bodies by words only; but the classification must proceed by
some constant and generally applicable process; and the knowledge
which has reference to the classification will be precise as far as
this process is precise, and vague as far as this is vague.</p>
<p>There must be, then, as a necessary supplement to Chemistry, a
Science of those properties of bodies by which we divide them into
<em>kinds</em>. Mineralogy is the branch of knowledge which has
discharged the office of such a science, so far as it has been
discharged; and, indeed, Mineralogy has been gradually approaching to
a clear consciousness of her real place, and of her whole task; I

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Prelude to the Epoch of De Lisle and
Haüy.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">OF</span> all the physical properties
of bodies, there is none so fixed, and in every way so remarkable, as
this;&#8212;that the same chemical compound always assumes, with the
utmost precision, the same geometrical form. This identity, however,
is not immediately obvious; it is often obscured by various mixtures
and imperfections in the substance; and even when it is complete, it
is not immediately recognized by a common eye, since it consists, not
in the equality of the sides or faces of the figures, but in the
equality of their angles. Hence it is not surprising that the
constancy of form was not detected by the early observers. Pliny
says,<a id="fnanchor1-15" href="#note1-15"><span
class="fnanchor">1</span></a> “Why crystal is generated in a hexagonal
form, it is difficult to assign a reason; and the more so, since,
while its faces are smoother than any art can make them, the pyramidal
points are <em>not all of the same kind</em>.” The quartz crystals of
the Alps, to which he refers, are, in some specimens, very regular,
while in others, one side of the pyramid becomes much the largest; yet
the angles remain constantly the same. But when the whole shape varied
so much, the angles also seemed to vary. Thus Conrad Gessner, a very
learned naturalist, who, in 1564, published at Zurich his work, <i>De
rerum Fossilium, Lapidum et Gemmarum maxime, Figuris</i>, says,<a
id="fnanchor2-15" href="#note2-15"><span class="fnanchor">2</span></a>
“One crystal differs from another in its angles, and consequently in
its figure.” And Cæsalpinus, who, as we shall <a
href="#b16-3-2">find</a>, did so much in establishing fixed characters
in botany, was led by some of his general views to disbelieve the
fixity of the form of crystals. In his work <i>De Metallicis</i>,
published at Nuremberg in 1602, he says,<a id="fnanchor3-15"
href="#note3-15"><span class="fnanchor">3</span></a> “To ascribe to
inanimate bodies a definite form, does not appear consentaneous to
reason; for it is the office of organization to produce a definite
form;” <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page317">317</a></span> an
opinion very natural in one who had been immersed in the study of the
general analogies of the forms of plants. But though this is excusable
in Cæsalpinus, the rejection of this definiteness of form a hundred
years later, when its existence had been proved, and its laws
developed by numerous observers, cannot be ascribed to anything but
strong prejudice; yet this was the course taken by no less a person
than Buffon. “The form of crystallization,” says he,<a
id="fnanchor4-15" href="#note4-15"><span class="fnanchor">4</span></a>
“is <em>not a constant character</em>, but is more equivocal and more
variable than any other of the characters by which minerals are to be
distinguished.” And accordingly, he makes no use of this most
important feature in his history of minerals. This strange
perverseness may perhaps be ascribed to the dislike which Buffon is
said to have entertained for Linnæus, who had made crystalline form a
leading character of minerals.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to mark all the minute steps by which
mineralogists were gradually led to see clearly the nature and laws of
the fixity of crystalline forms. These forms were at first noticed in
that substance which is peculiarly called rock-crystal or quartz; and
afterwards in various stones and gems, in salts obtained from various
solutions, and in snow. But those who observed the remarkable regular
figures which these substances assume, were at first impelled onwards
in their speculations by the natural tendency of the human mind to
generalize and guess, rather than to examine and measure. They
attempted to snatch at once the general laws of geometrical regularity
of these occurrences, or to connect them with some doctrine concerning
formative causes. Thus Kepler,<a id="fnanchor5-15"
href="#note5-15"><span class="fnanchor">5</span></a> in his
<i>Harmonics of the World</i>, asserts a “<i>formatrix facultas</i>,
which has its seat in the entrails of the earth, and, after the manner
of a pregnant woman, expresses the five regular geometrical solids in
the forms of gems.” But Philosophers, in the course of time, came to
build more upon observation, and less upon abstract reasonings.
Nicolas Steno, a Dane, published, in 1669, a dissertation <i>De Solido
intra Solidum Naturaliter contento</i>, in which he says,<a
id="fnanchor6-15" href="#note6-15"><span class="fnanchor">6</span></a>
that though the sides of the hexagonal crystal may vary, <em>the
angles are not changed</em>. And Dominic Gulielmini, in a
<i>Dissertation on Salts</i>, published in 1707, says,<a
id="fnanchor7-15" href="#note7-15"><span class="fnanchor">7</span></a>
in a true inductive spirit, “Nature does not employ all figures, but
only certain ones of those which are possible; and of these, the
determination is not to be fetched from the brain, or proved <i>à
priori</i>, but obtained by experiments and observations.” And <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page318">318</a></span> he speaks<a
id="fnanchor8-15" href="#note8-15"><span class="fnanchor">8</span></a>
with entire decision on this subject: “Nevertheless since there is
here a principle of crystallization, the inclination of the planes and
of the angles is always constant.” He even anticipates, very nearly,
the views of later crystallographers as to the mode in which crystals
are formed from elementary molecules. From this time, many persons
labored and speculated on this subject; as Cappeller, whose
<i>Prodromus Crystallographiæ</i> appeared at Lucern in 1723;
Bourguet, who published <i>Lettres Philosophiques sur la Formation de
Sels et de Cristaux</i>, at Amsterdam, in 1792; and Henckel, the
“Physicus” of the Elector of Saxony, whose <i>Pyritologia</i> came
forth in 1725. In this last work we have an example of the description
of the various forms of special classes of minerals, (iron pyrites,
copper pyrites, and arsenic pyrites;) and an example of the enthusiasm
which this apparently dry and laborious study can excite: “Neither
tongue nor stone,” he exclaims,<a id="fnanchor9-15"
href="#note9-15"><span class="fnanchor">9</span></a> “can express the
satisfaction which I received on setting eyes upon this sinter covered
with galena; and thus it constantly happens, that one must have more
pleasure in what seems worthless rubbish, than in the purest and most
precious ores, if we know aught of minerals.”</p>

<p>Still, however, Henckel<a id="fnanchor10-15"
href="#note10-15"><span class="fnanchor">10</span></a> disclaims the
intention of arranging minerals according to their mathematical forms;
and this, which may be considered as the first decided step in the
formation of crystallographic mineralogy, appears to have been first
attempted by Linnæus. In this attempt, however, he was by no means
happy; nor does he himself appear to have been satisfied. He begins
his preface by saying, “Lithology is not what I plume myself upon.”
(<i>Lithologia mihi cristas non eriget</i>.) Though his sagacity, as a
natural historian, led him to see that crystalline form was one of the
most definite, and therefore most important, characters of minerals,
he failed in profiting by this thought, because, in applying it, he
did not employ the light of geometry, but was regulated by what
appeared to him resemblances, arbitrarily selected, and often
delusive.<a id="fnanchor11-15" href="#note11-15"><span
class="fnanchor">11</span></a> Thus he derived the form of pyrites
from that of vitriol;<a id="fnanchor12-15" href="#note12-15"><span
class="fnanchor">12</span></a> and brought together alum and diamond
on account of their common octohedral form. But he had the great merit
of animating to this study one to whom, more perhaps than to any other
person, it owes its subsequent progress; I mean Romé de Lisle.
“Instructed,” this writer says, in his preface to his <i>Essais de
Crystallographie</i>, “by the works of the celebrated Von Linnée, how
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page319">319</a></span> greatly the
study of the angular form of crystals might become interesting, and
fitted to extend the sphere of our mineralogical knowledge, I have
followed them in all their metamorphoses with the most scrupulous
attention.” The views of Linnæus, as to the importance of this
character, had indeed been adopted by several others; as John Hill,
the King’s gardener at Kew, who, in 1777, published his
<i>Spathogenesia</i>; and Grignon, who, in 1775, says, “These
crystallizations may give the means of finding a new theory of the
generation of crystalline gems.”</p>

<p>The circumstance which threw so much difficulty in the way of those
who tried to follow out his thought was, that in consequence of the
apparent irregularity of crystals, arising from the extension or
contraction of particular sides of the figure, each kind of substance
may really appear under many different forms, connected with each
other by certain geometrical relations. These may be conceived by
considering a certain fundamental form to be cut into new forms in
particular ways. Thus if we take a cube, and cut off all the eight
corners, till the original faces disappear, we make it an octohedron;
and if we stop short of this, we have a figure of fourteen faces,
which has been called a <i>cubo-octohedron</i>. The first person who
appears distinctly to have conceived this <i>truncation</i> of angles
and edges, and to have introduced the word, is Démeste;<a
id="fnanchor13-15" href="#note13-15"><span
class="fnanchor">13</span></a> although Wallerius<a id="fnanchor14-15"
href="#note14-15"><span class="fnanchor">14</span></a> had already
said, in speaking of the various crystalline forms of calcspar, “I
conceive it would be better not to attend to all differences, lest we
be overwhelmed by the number.” And Werner, in his celebrated work
<i>On the External Characters of Minerals</i>,<a id="fnanchor15-15"
href="#note15-15"><span class="fnanchor">15</span></a> had formally
spoken of <i>truncation</i>, <i>acuation</i>, and <i>acumination</i>,
or replacement by a plane, an edge, a point respectively,
(<i>abstumpfung</i>, <i>zuschärfung</i>, <i>zuspitzung</i>,) as ways
in which the forms of crystals are modified and often disguised. He
applied this process in particular to show the connexion of the
various forms which are related to the cube. But still the extension
of the process to the whole range of minerals and other crystalline
bodies, was due to Romé de Lisle.</p>

<span class="sc">Epoch of Romé De Lisle and Haüy.&#8212;Establishment
of the Fixity of Crystalline Angles, and the Simplicity of the Laws of
Derivation.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">WE</span> have already seen that,
before 1780, several mineralogists had recognized the constancy of the
angles of crystals, and had seen (as Démeste and Werner,) that the
forms were subject to modifications of a definite kind. But neither of
these two thoughts was so apprehended and so developed, as to
supersede the occasion for a discoverer who should put forward these
principles as what they really were, the materials of a new and
complete science. The merit of this step belongs jointly to Romé de
Lisle and to Haüy. The former of these two men had already, in 1772,
published an <i>Essai de Crystallographie</i>, in which he had
described a number of crystals. But in this work his views are still
rude and vague; he does not establish any connected sequence of
transitions in each kind of substance, and lays little or no stress on
the angles. But in 1783, his ideas<a id="fnanchor16-15"
href="#note16-15"><span class="fnanchor">16</span></a> had reached a
maturity which, by comparison, excites our admiration. In this he
asserts, in the most distinct manner, the <em>invariability</em> of
the angles of crystals of each kind, under all the changes of relative
dimension which the faces may undergo;<a id="fnanchor17-15"
href="#note17-15"><span class="fnanchor">17</span></a> and he points
out that this invariability applies only to the <em>primitive
forms</em>, from each of which many secondary forms are derived by
various changes.<a id="fnanchor18-15" href="#note18-15"><span
class="fnanchor">18</span></a> Thus we cannot deny him the merit of
having taken steady hold on both the handles of this discovery, though
something still remained for another to do. Romé pursues his general
ideas into detail with great labor and skill. He gives drawings of
more than five hundred regular forms (in his first work he had
inserted only one hundred and ten; Linnæus only knew forty); and
assigns them to their proper substances; for instance, thirty to
calcspar, and sixteen to felspar. He also invented and used a
goniometer. We cannot doubt that he would have been <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page321">321</a></span> looked upon as a
great discoverer, if his fame had not been dimmed by the more
brilliant success of his contemporary Haüy.</p>

<p>Réné-Just Haüy is rightly looked upon as the founder of the modern
school of crystallography; for all those who have, since him, pursued
the study with success, have taken his views for their basis. Besides
publishing a system of crystallography and of mineralogy, far more
complete than any which had yet appeared, the peculiar steps in the
advance which belong to him are, the discovery of the importance of
<i>cleavage</i>, and the consequent expression of the laws of
derivation of secondary from primary forms, by means of the
<i>decrements</i> of the successive layers of <i>integrant
molecules</i>.</p>
<p>The latter of these discoveries had already been, in some measure,
anticipated by Bergman, who had, in 1773, conceived a hexagonal prism
to be built up by the juxtaposition of solid rhombs on the planes of a
rhombic nucleus.<a id="fnanchor19-15" href="#note19-15"><span
class="fnanchor">19</span></a> It is not clear<a id="fnanchor20-15"
href="#note20-15"><span class="fnanchor">20</span></a> whether Haüy
was acquainted with Bergman’s Memoir, at the time when the cleavage of
a hexagonal prism of calcspar, accidentally obtained, led him to the
same conception of its structure. But however this might be, he had
the indisputable credit of following out this conception with all the
vigor of originality, and with the most laborious and persevering
earnestness; indeed he made it the business of his life. The
hypothesis of a solid, built up of small solids, had this peculiar
advantage in reference to crystallography; it rendered a reason of
this curious fact;&#8212;that a certain series of forms occur in
crystals of the same kind, while other forms, apparently intermediate
between those which actually occur, are rigorously excluded. The
doctrine of decrements explained this; for by placing a number of
regularly-decreasing rows of equal solids, as, for instance, of
bricks, upon one another, we might form a regular equal-sided
triangle, as the gable of a house; and if the breadth of the gable
were one hundred bricks, the height of the triangle might be one
hundred, or fifty, or twenty-five; but it would be found that if the
height were an intermediate number, as fifty-seven, or forty-three,
the edge of the wall would become irregular; and such irregularity is
assumed to be inadmissible in the regular structure of crystals. Thus
this mode of conceiving crystals allows of certain definite secondary
forms, and no others.</p>

<p>The mathematical deduction of the dimensions and proportions <span

are explained with singular clearness and vivacity;&#8212;are services
by which Haüy richly earned the admiration which has been bestowed
upon him. The wonderful copiousness and variety of the forms and laws
to which he was led, thoroughly exercised and nourished the spirit of
deduction and calculation which his discoveries excited in him. The
reader may form some conception of the extent of his labors, by being
told&#8212;that the mere geometrical propositions which he found it
necessary to premise to his special descriptions, occupy a volume and
a half of his work;&#8212;that his diagrams are nearly a thousand in
number;&#8212;that in one single substance (calcspar) he has described
forty-seven varieties of form;&#8212;and that he has described one
kind of crystal (called by him <i>fer sulfuré parallélique</i>) which
has one hundred and thirty-four faces.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note21-15"
href="#fnanchor21-15">21</a></span> <i>Traité de Minéralogie</i>,
1801, 5 vols.</div>
<p>In the course of a long life, he examined, with considerable care,
all the forms he could procure of all kinds of mineral; and the
interpretation which he gave of the laws of those forms was, in many
cases, fixed, by means of a name applied to the mineral in which the
form occurred; thus, he introduced such names as <i>équiaxe</i>,
<i>métastatique</i>, <i>unibinaire</i>, <i>perihexahèdre</i>,
<i>bisalterne</i>, and others. It is not now desirable to apply
separate names to the different forms of the same mineral species, but
these terms answered the purpose, at the time, of making the subjects
of study more definite. A symbolical notation is the more convenient
mode of designating such forms, and such a notation Haüy invented; but
the symbols devised by him had many inconveniences, and have since
been superseded by the systems of other crystallographers.</p>
<p>Another of Haüy’s leading merits was, as we have already intimated,
to have shown, more clearly than his predecessors had done, that the
crystalline angles of substances are a criterion of the substances;
and that this is peculiarly true of the <em>angles of
cleavage</em>;&#8212;that is, the angles of those edges which are
obtained by cleaving a crystal in two different directions;&#8212;a
mode of division which the structure of many kinds of crystals allowed
him to execute in the most complete manner. As an instance of the
employment of this criterion, I may mention his separation of the
sulphates of baryta and strontia, which had <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page323">323</a></span> previously been confounded. Among
crystals which in the collections were ranked together as “heavy
spar,” and which were so perfect as to admit of accurate measurement,
he found that those which were brought from Sicily, and those of
Derbyshire, differed in their cleavage angle by three degrees and a
half. “I could not suppose,” he says,<a id="fnanchor22-15"
href="#note22-15"><span class="fnanchor">22</span></a> “that this
difference was the effect of any law of decrement; for it would have
been necessary to suppose so rapid and complex a law, that such an
hypothesis might have been justly regarded as an abuse of the theory.”
He was, therefore, in great perplexity. But a little while previous to
this, Klaproth had discovered that there is an earth which, though in
many respects it resembles baryta, is different from it in other
respects; and this earth, from the place where it was found (in
Scotland), had been named <i>Strontia</i>. The French chemists had
ascertained that the two earths had, in some cases, been mixed or
confounded; and Vauquelin, on examining the Sicilian crystals, found
that their base was strontia, and not, as in the Derbyshire ones,
baryta. The riddle was now read; all the crystals with the larger
angle belong to the one, all those with the smaller, to the other, of
these two sulphates; and crystallometry was clearly recognized as an
authorized test of the difference of substances which nearly resemble
each other.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note22-15"
href="#fnanchor22-15">22</a></span> <i>Traité</i>, ii. 320.</div>
<p>Enough has been said, probably, to enable the reader to judge how
much each of the two persons, now under review, contributed to
crystallography. It would be unwise to compare such contributions to
science with the great discoveries of astronomy and chemistry; and we
have seen how nearly the predecessors of Romé and Haüy had reached the
point of knowledge on which these two crystallographers took their
stand. But yet it is impossible not to allow, that in these
discoveries, which thus gave form and substance to the science of
crystallography, we have a manifestation of no common sagacity and
skill. Here, as in other discoveries, were required ideas and
facts;&#8212;clearness of geometrical conception which could deal with
most complex relations of form; a minute and extensive acquaintance
with actual crystals; and the talent and habit of referring these
facts to the general ideas. Haüy, in particular, was happily endowed
for his task. Without being a great mathematician, he was sufficiently
a geometer to solve all the problems which his undertaking demanded;
and though the mathematical reasoning might have been made more
compendious <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page324">324</a></span> by
one who was more at home in mathematical generalization, probably this
could hardly have been done without making the subject less accessible
and less attractive to persons moderately disciplined in mathematics.
In all his reasonings upon particular cases, Haüy is acute and clear;
while his general views appear to be suggested rather by a lively
fancy than by a sage inductive spirit: and though he thus misses the
character of a great philosopher, the vivacity of style, and felicity
and happiness of illustration, which grace his book, and which agree
well with the character of an Abbé of the old French monarchy, had a
great and useful influence on the progress of the subject.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Romé de Lisle and Haüy were not only rivals, but in
some measure enemies. The former might naturally feel some vexation at
finding himself, in his later years (he died in 1790), thrown into
shade by his more brilliant successor. In reference to Haüy’s use of
cleavage, he speaks<a id="fnanchor23-15" href="#note23-15"><span
class="fnanchor">23</span></a> of “innovators in crystallography, who
may properly be called <i>crystalloclasts</i>.” Yet he adopted, in
great measure, the same views of the formation of crystals by
laminæ,<a id="fnanchor24-15" href="#note24-15"><span
class="fnanchor">24</span></a> which Haüy illustrated by the
destructive process at which he thus sneers. His sensitiveness was
kept alive by the conduct of the Academy of Sciences, which took no
notice of him and his labors;<a id="fnanchor25-15"
href="#note25-15"><span class="fnanchor">25</span></a> probably
because it was led by Buffon, who disliked Linnæus, and might dislike
Romé as his follower; and who, as we have <a
href="#v2page317">seen</a>, despised crystallography. Haüy revenged
himself by rarely mentioning Romé in his works, though it was manifest
that his obligations to him were immense; and by recording his errors
while he corrected them. More fortunate than his rival, Haüy was, from
the first, received with favor and applause. His lectures at Paris
were eagerly listened to by persons from all quarters of the world.
His views were, in this manner, speedily diffused; and the subject was
soon pursued, in various ways, by mathematicians and mineralogists in
every country of Europe.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Reception and Corrections of the Hauïan
Crystallography.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">I HAVE</span> not hitherto noticed
the imperfections of the crystallographic views and methods of Haüy,
because my business in the last section <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page325">325</a></span> was to mark the permanent additions he
made to the science. His system did, however, require completion and
rectification in various points; and in speaking of the
crystallographers of the subsequent time, who may all be considered as
the cultivators of the Hauïan doctrines, we must also consider what
they did in correcting them.</p>
<p>The three main points in which this improvement was needed
were;&#8212;a better determination of the crystalline forms of the
special substances;&#8212;a more general and less arbitrary method of
considering crystalline forms according to their symmetry; and a
detection of more general conditions by which the crystalline angle is
regulated. The first of these processes may be considered as the
natural sequel of the Hauïan epoch: the other two must be treated as
separate steps of discovery.</p>
<p>When it appeared that the angle of natural or of cleavage faces
could be used to determine the differences of minerals, it became
important to measure this angle with accuracy. Haüy’s measurements
were found very inaccurate by many succeeding crystallographers: Mohs
says<a id="fnanchor26-15" href="#note26-15"><span
class="fnanchor">26</span></a> that they are so generally inaccurate,
that no confidence can be placed in them. This was said, of course,
according to the more rigorous notions of accuracy to which the
establishment of Haüy’s system led. Among the persons who principally
labored in ascertaining, with precision, the crystalline angles of
minerals, were several Englishmen, especially Wollaston, Phillips, and
Brooke. Wollaston, by the invention of his Reflecting Goniometer,
placed an entirely new degree of accuracy within the reach of the
crystallographer; the angle of two faces being, in this instrument,
measured by means of the reflected images of bright objects seen in
them, so that the measure is the more accurate the more minute the
faces are. In the use of this instrument, no one was more laborious
and successful than William Phillips, whose power of apprehending the
most complex forms with steadiness and clearness, led Wollaston to say
that he had “a geometrical sense.” Phillips published a Treatise on
Mineralogy, containing a great collection of such determinations; and
Mr. Brooke, a crystallographer of the same exact and careful school,
has also published several works of the same kind. The precise
measurement of crystalline angles must be the familiar employment of
all who study crystallography; and, therefore, any further enumeration
of those <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page326">326</a></span> who
have added in this way to the stock of knowledge, would be
superfluous.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note26-15"
href="#fnanchor26-15">26</a></span> Marx. p. 153.</div>
<p>Nor need I dwell long on those who added to the knowledge which
Haüy left, of derived forms. The most remarkable work of this kind was
that of Count Bournon, who published a work on a single mineral
(calcspar) in three quarto volumes.<a id="fnanchor27-15"
href="#note27-15"><span class="fnanchor">27</span></a> He has here
given representations of seven hundred forms of crystals, of which,
however, only fifty-six are essentially different. From this example
the reader may judge what a length of time, and what a number of
observers and calculators, were requisite to exhaust the subject.</p>

1808.</div>
<p>If the calculations, thus occasioned, had been conducted upon the
basis of Haüy’s system, without any further generalization, they would
have belonged to that process, the natural sequel of inductive
discoveries, which we call <i>deduction</i>; and would have needed
only a very brief notice here. But some additional steps were made in
the upward road to scientific truth, and of these we must now give an
account.</p>
<hr class="three space-above" />
<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Establishment of the Distinction of Systems of
Crystallization.&#8212;Weiss and Mohs.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IN</span> Haüy’s views, as generally
happens in new systems, however true, there was involved something
that was arbitrary, something that was false or doubtful, something
that was unnecessarily limited. The principal points of this kind
were;&#8212;his having made the laws of crystalline derivation depend
so much upon cleavage;&#8212;his having assumed an atomic constitution
of bodies as an essential part of his system; and his having taken a
set of primary forms, which, being selected by no general view, were
partly superfluous, and partly defective.</p>
<p>How far evidence, such as has been referred to by various
philosophers, has proved, or can prove, that bodies are constituted of
indivisible atoms, will be more fully examined in the work which
treats of the Philosophy of this subject. There can be little doubt
that the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page327">327</a></span>
portion of Haüy’s doctrine which most riveted popular attention and
applause, was his dissection of crystals, in a manner which was
supposed to lead actually to their ultimate material elements. Yet it
is clear, that since the solids given by cleavage are, in many cases,
such as cannot make up a solid space, the primary conception of a
necessary geometrical identity between the results of division and the
elements of composition, which is the sole foundation of the
supposition that crystallography points out the actual elements,
disappears on being scrutinized: and when Haüy, pressed by this
difficulty, as in the case of fluor-spar, put his integrant octohedral
molecules together, touching by the edges only, his method became an
empty geometrical diagram, with no physical meaning.</p>
<p>The real fact, divested of the hypothesis which was contained in
the fiction of decrements, was, that when the relation of the
derivative to the primary faces is expressed by means of numerical
indices, these numbers are integers, and generally very small ones;
and this was the form which the law gradually assumed, as the method
of derivation was made more general and simple by Weiss and
others.</p>
<p>“When, in 1809, I published my Dissertation,” says Weiss,<a
id="fnanchor28-15" href="#note28-15"><span
class="fnanchor">28</span></a> “I shared the common opinion as to the
necessity of the assumption and the reality of the existence of a
primitive form, at least in a sense not very different from the usual
sense of the expression. While I sought,” he adds, referring to
certain doctrines of general philosophy which he and others
entertained, “a <em>dynamical</em> ground for this, instead of the
untenable atomistic view, I found that, out of my primitive forms,
there was gradually unfolded to my hands, that which really governs
them, and is not affected by their casual fluctuations, the
fundamental relations of those Dimensions according to which a
multiplicity of internal oppositions, necessarily and mutually
interdependent, are developed in the mass, each having its own
polarity; so that the crystalline character is co-extensive with these
polarities.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note28-15"
href="#fnanchor28-15">28</a></span> <i>Mem. Acad. Berl.</i> 1816, p.
307.</div>
<p>The “Dimensions” of which Weiss here speaks, are the <i>Axes of
Symmetry</i> of the crystal; that is, those lines in reference to
which, every face is accompanied by other faces, having like positions
and properties. Thus a rhomb, or more properly a
<em>rhombohedron</em>,<a id="fnanchor29-15" href="#note29-15"><span
class="fnanchor">29</span></a> of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page328">328</a></span> calcspar may be placed with one of its
obtuse corners uppermost, so that all the three faces which meet there
are equally inclined to the vertical line. In this position, every
derivative face, which is obtained by any modification of the faces or
edges of the rhombohedron, implies either three or six such derivative
faces; for no one of the three upper faces of the rhombohedron has any
character or property different from the other two; and, therefore,
there is no reason for the existence of a derivative from one of these
primitive faces, which does not equally hold for the other primitive
faces. Hence the derivative forms will, in all cases, contain none but
faces connected by this kind of correspondence. The axis thus made
vertical will be an Axis of Symmetry, and the crystal will consist of
three divisions, ranged round this axis, and exactly resembling each
other. According to Weiss’s nomenclature, such a crystal is
“three-and-three-membered.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note29-15"
href="#fnanchor29-15">29</a></span> I use this name for the solid
figure, since <i>rhomb</i> has always been used for a plane
figure.</div>
<p>But this is only one of the kinds of symmetry which crystalline
forms may exhibit. They may have <i>three axes</i> of complete and
<i>equal</i> symmetry at right angles to each other, as the cube and
the regular octohedron;&#8212;or, <i>two axes</i> of equal symmetry,
perpendicular to each other and to a <i>third axis</i>, which is not
affected with the same symmetry with which they are; such a figure is
a square pyramid;&#8212;or they may have <i>three</i> rectangular
<i>axes</i>, all of <i>unequal</i> symmetry, the modifications
referring to each axis separately from the other two.</p>
<p>These are essential and necessary distinctions of crystalline form;
and the introduction of a classification of forms founded on such
relations, or, as they were called, <i>Systems of Crystallization</i>,
was a great improvement upon the divisions of the earlier
crystallographers, for those divisions were separated according to
certain arbitrarily-assumed primary forms. Thus Romé de Lisle’s
fundamental forms were, the tetrahedron, the cube, the octohedron, the
rhombic prism, the rhombic octohedron, the dodecahedron with
triangular faces: Haüy’s primary forms are the cube, the rhombohedron,
the oblique rhombic prism, the right rhombic prism, the rhombic
dodecahedron, the regular octohedron, tetrahedron, and six-sided
prism, and the bipyramidal dodecahedron. This division, as I have
already said, errs both by excess and defect, for some of these
primary forms might be made derivatives from others; and no solid
reason could be assigned why they were not. Thus the cube may be
derived from the tetrahedron, by truncating the edges; and the rhombic
dodecahedron again from the cube, by truncating its edges; while the
square pyramid could not be legitimately identified with the
derivative of any of these forms; for if we were to <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page329">329</a></span> derive it from the
rhombic prism, why should the acute angles always suffer decrements
corresponding in a certain way to those of the obtuse angles, as they
must do in order to give rise to a square pyramid?</p>
<p>The introduction of the method of reference to Systems of
Crystallization has been a subject of controversy, some ascribing this
valuable step to Weiss, and some to Mohs.<a id="fnanchor30-15"
href="#note30-15"><span class="fnanchor">30</span></a> It appears, I
think, on the whole, that Weiss first published works in which the
method is employed; but that Mohs, by applying it to all the known
species of minerals, has had the merit of making it the basis of real
crystallography. Weiss, in 1809, published a Dissertation <i>On the
mode of investigating the principal geometrical character of
crystalline forms</i>, in which he says,<a id="fnanchor31-15"
href="#note31-15"><span class="fnanchor">31</span></a> “No part, line,
or quantity, is so important as the axis; no consideration is more
essential or of a higher order than the relation of a crystalline
plane to the axis;” and again, “An axis is any line governing the
figure, about which all parts are similarly disposed, and with
reference to which they correspond mutually.” This he soon followed
out by examination of some difficult cases, as Felspar and Epidote. In
the Memoirs of the Berlin Academy,<a id="fnanchor32-15"
href="#note32-15"><span class="fnanchor">32</span></a> for
1814&#8211;15, he published <i>An Exhibition of the natural Divisions
of Systems of Crystallization</i>. In this Memoir, his divisions are
as follows:&#8212;The <i>regular</i> system, the <i>four-membered</i>,
the <i>two-and-two-membered</i>, the <i>three-and-three-membered</i>,
and some others of inferior degrees of symmetry. These divisions are
by Mohs (<i>Outlines of Mineralogy</i>, 1822), termed the
<i>tessular</i>, <i>pyramidal</i>, <i>prismatic</i>, and
<i>rhombohedral</i> systems respectively. Hausmann, in his
<i>Investigations concerning the Forms of Inanimate Nature</i>,<a
id="fnanchor33-15" href="#note33-15"><span
class="fnanchor">33</span></a> makes a nearly corresponding
arrangement;&#8212;the <i>isometric</i>, <i>monodimetric</i>,
<i>trimetric</i>, and <i>monotrimetic</i>; and one or other of these
sets of terms have been adopted by most succeeding writers.</p>

<p>In order to make the distinctions more apparent, I have purposely
omitted to speak of the systems which arise when the <i>prismatic</i>
system loses some part of its symmetry;&#8212;when it has only half or
a quarter its complete number of faces;&#8212;or, according to Mohs’s
phraseology, when it is <i>hemihedral</i> or <i>tetartohedral</i>.
Such systems are represented by the singly-oblique or doubly-oblique
prism; they are termed by Weiss <i>two-and-one-membered</i>, and
<i>one-and-one-membered</i>; by other writers, <i>Monoklinometric</i>,
and <i>Triklinometric</i> Systems. There are also other <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page330">330</a></span> peculiarities of
Symmetry, such, for instance, as that of the <i>plagihedral</i> faces
of quartz, and other minerals.</p>
<p>The introduction of an arrangement of crystalline forms into
systems, according to their degree of symmetry, was a step which was
rather founded on a distinct and comprehensive perception of
mathematical relations, than on an acquaintance with experimental
facts, beyond what earlier mineralogists had possessed. This
arrangement was, however, remarkably confirmed by some of the
properties of minerals which attracted notice about the time now
spoken of, as we shall see in the next chapter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Reception and Confirmation of the Distinction of
Systems of Crystallization.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">DIFFUSION of the Distinction of
Systems</span>.&#8212;The distinction of systems of crystallization
was so far founded on obviously true views, that it was speedily
adopted by most mineralogists. I need not dwell on the steps by which
this took place. Mr. Haidinger’s translation of Mohs was a principal
occasion of its introduction in England. As an indication of dates,
bearing on this subject, perhaps I may be allowed to notice, that
there appeared in the <i>Philosophical Transactions for</i> 1825, <i>A
General Method of Calculating the <span class="correction"
title="emended from Angels">Angles</span> of Crystals</i>, which I had
written, and in which I referred only to Haüy’s views; but that in
1826,<a id="fnanchor34-15" href="#note34-15"><span
class="fnanchor">34</span></a> I published a Memoir <i>On the
Classification of Crystalline Combinations</i>, founded on the methods
of Weiss and Mohs, especially the latter; with which I had in the mean
time become acquainted, and which appeared to me to contain their own
evidence and recommendation. General methods, such as was attempted in
the Memoir just quoted, are part of that process in the history of
sciences, by which, when the principles are once established, the
mathematical operation of deducing their consequences is made more and
more general and symmetrical: which we have seen already exemplified
in the history of celestial mechanics after the time of Newton. It
does not enter into our plan, to dwell upon the various steps in this
way <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page331">331</a></span> made by
Levy, Naumann, Grassmann, Kupffer, Hessel, and by Professor Miller
among ourselves. I may notice that one great improvement was, the
method introduced by Monteiro and Levy, of determining the laws of
derivation of forces by means of the <i>parallelisms of edges</i>;
which was afterwards extended so that faces were considered as
belonging to <i>zones</i>. Nor need I attempt to enumerate (what
indeed it would be difficult to describe in words) the various methods
of <i>notation</i> by which it has been proposed to represent the
faces of crystals, and to facilitate the calculations which have
reference to them.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note34-15"
href="#fnanchor34-15">34</a></span> <i>Camb. Trans.</i> vol. ii. p.
391.</div>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [My Memoir of 1825 depended on the views of Haüy in so
far as that I started from his “primitive forms;” but being a general
method of expressing all forms by co-ordinates, it was very little
governed by these views. The mode of representing crystalline forms
which I proposed seemed to contain its own evidence of being more true
to nature than Haüy’s theory of decrements, inasmuch as my method
expressed the faces at much lower numbers. I determine a face by means
of the dimensions of the primary form <em>divided</em> by certain
numbers; Haüy had expressed the face virtually by the same dimensions
<em>multiplied</em> by numbers. In cases where my notation gives such
numbers as (3, 4, 1), (1, 3, 7), (5, 1, 19), his method involves the
higher numbers (4, 3, 12), (21, 7, 3), (19, 95, 5). My method however
has, I believe, little value as a method of “<em>calculating</em> the
angles of crystals.”</p>
<p>M. Neumann, of Königsberg, introduced a very convenient and elegant
mode of representing the position of faces of crystals by
corresponding points on the surface of a circumscribing sphere. He
gave (in 1823) the laws of the derivation of crystalline faces,
expressed geometrically by the intersection of zones, (<i>Beiträge zur
Krystallonomie</i>.) The same method of indicating the position of
faces of crystals was afterwards, together with the notation,
re-invented by M. Grassmann, (<i>Zur Krystallonomie und Geometrischen
Combinationslehre</i>, 1829.) Aiding himself by the suggestions of
these writers, and partly adopting my method, Prof. Miller has
produced a work on Crystallography remarkable for mathematical
elegance and symmetry; and has given expressions really useful for
calculating the angles of crystalline faces, (<i>A Treatise on
Crystallography</i>. Cambridge, 1839.)]</p>
<p><i>Confirmation of the Distinction of Systems by the Optical
Properties of Minerals.&#8212;Brewster.</i>&#8212;I must not omit to
notice the striking confirmation which the distinction of systems of
crystallization received from optical discoveries, especially those of
Sir D. Brewster. Of the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page332">332</a></span> history of this very rich and beautiful
department of science, we have already given some account, in speaking
of <a href="#v2page69">Optics</a>. The first facts which were noticed, those relating to
double refraction, belonged exclusively to crystals of the
rhombohedral system. The splendid phenomena of the rings and
lemniscates produced by dipolarizing crystals, were afterwards
discovered; and these were, in 1817, classified by Sir David Brewster,
according to the crystalline forms to which they belong. This
classification, on comparison with the distinction of Systems of
Crystallization, resolved itself into a necessary relation of
mathematical symmetry: all crystals of the pyramidal and rhombohedral
systems, which from their geometrical character have a single axis of
symmetry, are also optically uniaxal, and produce by dipolarization
circular rings; while the prismatic system, which has no such single
axis, but three unequal axes of symmetry, is optically biaxal, gives
lemniscates by dipolarized light, and according to Fresnel’s theory,
has three rectangular axes of unequal elasticity.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [I have placed Sir David Brewster’s arrangement of
crystalline forms in this chapter, as an event belonging to the
<em>confirmation</em> of the distinctions of forms introduced by Weiss
and Mohs; because that arrangement was established, not on
crystallographical, but on optical grounds. But Sir David Brewster’s
optical discovery was a much greater step in science than the systems
of the two German crystallographers; and even in respect to the
crystallographical principle, Sir D. Brewster had an independent share
in the discovery. He divided crystalline forms into three classes,
enumerating the Hauïan “primitive forms” which belonged to each; and
as he found some exceptions to this classification, (such as idocrase,
&amp;c.,) he ventured to pronounce that in those substances the
received primitive forms were probably erroneous; a judgment which was
soon confirmed by a closer crystallographical scrutiny. He also showed
his perception of the mineralogical importance of his discovery by
publishing it, not only in the <i>Phil. Trans.</i> (1818), but also in
the <i>Transactions of the Wernerian Society of Natural History</i>.
In a second paper inserted in this later series, read in 1820, he
further notices Mohs’s System of Crystallography, which had then
recently appeared, and points out its agreement with his own.</p>
<p>Another reason why I do not make his great optical discovery a
cardinal point in the history of crystallography is, that as a
crystallographical system it is incomplete. Although we are thus led
to distinguish the <i>tessular</i> and the <i>prismatic</i> systems
(using Mohs’s terms) <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page333">333</a></span> from the <i>rhombohedral</i> and the
<i>square prismatic</i>, we are not led to distinguish the latter two
from each other; inasmuch as they have no optical difference of
character. But this distinction is quite essential in crystallography;
for these two systems have faces formed by laws as different as those
of the other two systems.</p>
<p>Moreover, Weiss and Mohs not only divided crystalline forms into
certain classes, but showed that by doing this, the derivation of all
the existing forms from the fundamental ones assumed a new aspect of
simplicity and generality; and this was the essential part of what
they did.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I do not think it is too much to say as I have
elsewhere said<a id="fnanchor35-15" href="#note35-15"><span
class="fnanchor">35</span></a> that “Sir D. Brewster’s optical
experiments must have led to a classification of crystals into the
above systems, or something nearly equivalent, even if crystals had
not been so arranged by attention to their forms.”]</p>

href="#fnanchor35-15">35</a></span> <i>Philosophy of the Inductive
Sciences</i>, B. viii. C. iii. Art. 3.</div>
<p>Many other most curious trains of research have confirmed the
general truth, that the degree and kind of geometrical symmetry
corresponds exactly with the symmetry of the optical properties. As an
instance of this, eminently striking for its singularity, we may
notice the discovery of Sir John Herschel, that the <i>plagihedral</i>
crystallization of quartz, by which it exhibits faces <em>twisted</em>
to the right or the left, is accompanied by right-handed or
left-handed circular polarization respectively. No one acquainted with
the subject can now doubt, that the correspondence of geometrical and
optical symmetry is of the most complete and fundamental kind.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [Our knowledge with respect to the positions of the
optical axes of the oblique prismatic crystals is still imperfect. It
appears to be ascertained that, in singly oblique crystals, one of the
axes of optical elasticity coincides with the rectangular
crystallographic axis. In doubly oblique crystals, one of the axes of
optical elasticity is, in many cases, coincident with the axis of a
principal zone. I believe no more determinate laws have been
discovered.]</p>
<p>Thus the highest generalization at which mathematical
crystallographers have yet arrived, may be considered as fully
established; and the science of Crystallography, in the condition in
which these place it, is fit to be employed as one of the members of
Mineralogy, and thus to fill its appropriate place and office.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="sc">DISCOVERY of Isomorphism.
Mitscherlich</span>.&#8212;The discovery of which we now have to speak
may appear at first sight too large to be included in the history of
crystallography, and may seem to belong rather to chemistry. But it is
to be recollected that crystallography, from the time of its first
assuming importance in the hands of Haüy, founded its claim to notice
entirely upon its connexion with chemistry; crystalline forms were
properties of <em>something</em>; but <em>what</em> that something
was, and how it might be modified without becoming something else, no
crystallographer could venture to decide, without the aid of chemical
analysis. Haüy had assumed, as the general result of his researches,
that the same chemical elements, combined in the same proportions,
would always exhibit the same crystalline form; and reciprocally, that
the same form and angles (except in the obvious case of the tessular
system, in which the angles are determined by its <em>being</em> the
tessular system,) implied the same chemical constitution. But this
dogma could only be considered as an approximate conjecture; for there
were many glaring and unexplained exceptions to it. The explanation of
several of these was beautifully described by the discovery that there
are various elements which are <i>isomorphous</i> to each other; that
is, such that one may take the place of another without altering the
crystalline form; and thus the chemical composition may be much
changed, while the crystallographic character is undisturbed.</p>
<p>This truth had been caught sight of, probably as a guess only, by
Fuchs as early as 1815. In speaking of a mineral which had been called
Gehlenite, he says, “I hold the oxide of iron, not for an essential
component part of this genus, but only as a <em>vicarious</em>
element, replacing so much lime. We shall find it necessary to
consider the results of several analyses of mineral bodies in this
point of view, if we wish, on the one hand, to bring them into
agreement with the doctrine of chemical proportions, and on the other,
to avoid unnecessarily splitting up genera.” In a lecture <i>On the
Mutual Influence of</i> <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page335">335</a></span> <i>Chemistry and Mineralogy</i>,<a
id="fnanchor36-15" href="#note36-15"><span
class="fnanchor">36</span></a> he again draws attention to his term
<i>vicarious</i> (<i>vicarirende</i>), which undoubtedly expresses the
nature of the general law afterwards established by Mitscherlich in
1822.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note36-15"
href="#fnanchor36-15">36</a></span> Munich, 1820.</div>
<p>But Fuchs’s conjectural expression was only a prelude to
Mitscherlich’s experimental discovery of isomorphism. Till many
careful analyses had given substance and signification to this
conception of vicarious elements, it was of small value. Perhaps no
one was more capable than Berzelius of turning to the best advantage
any ideas which were current in the chemical world; yet we find him,<a
id="fnanchor37-15" href="#note37-15"><span
class="fnanchor">37</span></a> in 1820, dwelling upon a certain vague
view of these cases,&#8212;that “oxides which contain equal doses of
oxygen must have their general properties common;” without tracing it
to any definite conclusions. But his scholar, Mitscherlich, gave this
proposition a real crystallographical import. Thus he found that the
carbonates of lime (calcspar,) of magnesia, of protoxide of iron, and
of protoxide of manganese, agree in many respects of form, while the
homologous angles vary through one or two degrees only; so again the
carbonates of baryta, strontia, lead, and lime (arragonite), agree
nearly; the different kinds of felspar vary only by the substitution
of one alkali for another; the phosphates are almost identical with
the arseniates of several bases. These, and similar results, were
expressed by saying that, in such cases, the bases, lime, protoxide of
iron, and the rest, are <i>isomorphous</i>; or in the latter instance,
that the arsenic and phosphoric acids are isomorphous.</p>

href="#fnanchor37-15">37</a></span> <i>Essay on the Theory of Chemical
Proportions</i>, p. 122.</div>
<p>Since, in some of these cases, the substitution of one element of
the isomorphous group for another does alter the angle, though
slightly, it has since been proposed to call such groups
<i>plesiomorphous</i>.</p>
<p>This discovery of isomorphism was of great importance, and excited
much attention among the chemists of Europe. The history of its
reception, however, belongs, in part, to the classification of
minerals; for its effect was immediately to metamorphose the existing
chemical systems of arrangement. But even those crystallographers and
chemists who cared little for general systems of classification,
received a powerful impulse by the expectation, which was now excited,
of discovering definite laws connecting chemical constitution with
crystalline form. Such investigations were soon carried on with great
activity. Thus, at a recent period, Abich analysed a number of
tessular minerals, spinelle, pleonaste, gahnite, franklinite, and
chromic iron oxide; and <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page336">336</a></span> seems to have had some success in <span
class="correction" title="emended from given">giving</span> a common
type to their chemical formulæ, as there is a common type in their
crystallization.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [It will be seen by the above account that Prof.
Mitscherlich’s merit in the great discovery of Isomorphism is not at
all narrowed by the previous conjectures of M. Fuchs. I am informed,
moreover, that M. Fuchs afterwards (in Schweigger’s <i>Journal</i>)
retracted the opinions he had put forward on this subject.]</p>
<p><i>Dimorphism.</i>&#8212;My business is, to point out the connected
truths which have been obtained by philosophers, rather than insulated
difficulties which still stand out to perplex them. I need not,
therefore, dwell on the curious cases of <i>dimorphism</i>; cases in
which the same definite chemical compound of the same elements appears
to have two different forms; thus the carbonate of lime has two forms,
<i>calcspar</i> and <i>arragonite</i>, which belong to different
systems of crystallization. Such facts may puzzle us; but they hardly
interfere with any received general truths, because we have as yet no
truths of very high order respecting the connexion of chemical
constitution and crystalline form. Dimorphism does not interfere with
isomorphism; the two classes of facts stand at the same stage of
inductive generalization, and we wait for some higher truth which
shall include both, and rise above them.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [For additions to our knowledge of the Dimorphism of
Bodies, see Professor Johnstone’s valuable <i>Report</i> on that
subject in the <i>Reports of the British Association</i> for 1837.
Substances have also been found which are <i>trimorphous</i>. We owe
to Professor Mitscherlich the discovery of dimorphism, as well as of
isomorphism: and to him also we owe the greater part of the knowledge
to which these discoveries have led.]</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Attempts to Establish the Fixity of other Physical
Properties.&#8212;Werner.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> reflections from which it
appeared, (at the end of the last <a href="#v2page305">Book</a>,) that
in order to obtain general knowledge respecting bodies, we must give
scientific fixity to our appreciation of their properties, applies to
their other properties as well as to their crystalline <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page337">337</a></span> form. And though none
of the other properties have yet been referred to standards so
definite as that which geometry supplies for crystals, a system has
been introduced which makes their measures far more constant and
precise than they are to a common undisciplined sense.</p>
<p>The author of this system was Abraham Gottlob Werner, who had been
educated in the institutions which the Elector of Saxony had
established at the mines of Freiberg. Of an exact and methodical
intellect, and of great acuteness of the senses, Werner was well
fitted for the task of giving fixity to the appreciation of outward
impressions; and this he attempted in his <i>Dissertation on the
external Characters of Fossils</i>, which was published at Leipzig in
1774. Of the precision of his estimation of such characters, we may
judge from the following story, told by his biographer Frisch.<a
id="fnanchor38-15" href="#note38-15"><span
class="fnanchor">38</span></a> One of his companions had received a
quantity of pieces of amber, and was relating to Werner, then very
young, that he had found in the lot one piece from which he could
extract no signs of electricity. Werner requested to be allowed to put
his hand in the bag which contained these pieces, and immediately drew
out the unelectrical piece. It was yellow chalcedony, which is
distinguishable from amber by its weight and coldness.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note38-15"
href="#fnanchor38-15">38</a></span> <i>Werner’s Leben</i>, p.
26.</div>
<p>The principal external characters which were subjected by Werner to
a systematic examination were color, lustre, hardness, and specific
gravity. His subdivisions of the first character (<i>Color</i>), were
very numerous; yet it cannot be doubted that if we recollect them by
the eye, and not by their names, they are definite and valuable
characters, and especially the metallic colors. Breithaupt, merely by
the aid of this character, distinguished two new compounds among the
small grains found along with the grains of platinum, and usually
confounded with them. The kinds of <i>Lustre</i>, namely,
<i>glassy</i>, <i>fatty</i>, <i>adamantine</i>, <i>metallic</i>, are,
when used in the same manner, equally valuable. <i>Specific
Gravity</i> obviously admits of a numerical measure; and the
<i>Hardness</i> of a mineral was pretty exactly defined by the
substances which it would scratch, and by which it was capable of
being scratched.</p>
<p>Werner soon acquired a reputation as a mineralogist, which drew
persons from every part of Europe to Freiberg in order to hear his
lectures; and thus diffused very widely his mode of employing external
characters. It was, indeed, impossible to attend so closely to <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page338">338</a></span> these characters as
the Wernerian method required, without finding that they were more
distinctive than might at first sight be imagined; and the analogy
which this mode of studying Mineralogy established between that and
other branches of Natural History, recommended the method to those in
whom a general inclination to such studies was excited. Thus Professor
Jameson of Edinburgh, who had been one of the pupils of Werner at
Freiberg, not only published works in which he promulgated the
mineralogical doctrines of his master, but established in Edinburgh a
“Wernerian Society,” having for its object the general cultivation of
Natural History.</p>
<p>Werner’s standards and nomenclature of external characters were
somewhat modified by Mohs, who, with the same kinds of talents and
views, succeeded him at Freiberg. Mohs reduced hardness to numerical
measure by selecting ten known minerals, each harder than the other in
order, from <i>talc</i> to <i>corundum</i> and <i>diamond</i>, and by
making the place which these minerals occupy in the list, the
numerical measure of the hardness of those which are compared with
them. The result of the application of this fixed measurement and
nomenclature of external characters will appear in the History of
Classification, to which we now proceed.</p>

<span class="sc">Attempts at the Classification of
Minerals.</span></h3>
<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Proper object of
Classification.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> fixity of the crystalline
and other physical properties of minerals is turned to account by
being made the means of classifying such objects. To use the language
of Aristotle,<a id="fnanchor39-15" href="#note39-15"><span
class="fnanchor">39</span></a> Classification is the
<i>architectonic</i> science, to which Crystallography and the
Doctrine of External Characters are subordinate and ministerial, as
the art of the bricklayer and carpenter are to that of the architect.
But classification itself is useful only as subservient to an ulterior
science, which shall furnish us with knowledge concerning things so
classified. To classify is to divide and to name; and the value of the
Divisions which we thus make, and of the names which we give them, is
this;&#8212;that they render exact knowledge and general propositions
possible. Now the knowledge which we principally seek concerning
minerals is a knowledge of their chemical composition; the general
propositions to which we hope to be led are such as assert relations
between their intimate constitution and their external attributes.
Thus our Mineralogical Classification must always have an eye turned
towards Chemistry. We cannot get rid of the fundamental conviction,
that the elementary composition of bodies, since it fixes their
essence, must determine their properties. Hence all mineralogical
arrangements, whether they profess it or not, must be, in effect,
chemical; they must have it for their object to bring into view a set
of relations, which, whatever else they may be, are at least chemical
relations. We may begin with the outside, but it is only in order to
reach the inner <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page340">340</a></span>
structure. We may classify without reference to chemistry; but if we
do so, it is only that we may assert chemical propositions with
reference to our classification.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note39-15"
href="#fnanchor39-15">39</a></span> <i>Eth. Nicom.</i> i. 2.</div>
<p>But, as we have <a href="#v2page305">already</a> attempted to show,
we not only may, but we <em>must</em> classify, by other than chemical
characters, in order to be able to make our classification the basis
of chemical knowledge. In order to assert chemical truths concerning
bodies, we must have the bodies known by some tests not chemical. The
chemist cannot assert that Arragonite does or does not contain
Strontia, except the mineralogist can tell him whether any given
specimen is or is not <i>Arragonite</i>. If chemistry be called upon
to supply the <em>definitions</em> as well as the <em>doctrines</em>
of mineralogy, the science can only consist of identical
propositions.</p>
<p>Yet chemistry has been much employed in mineralogical
classifications, and, it is generally believed, with advantage to the
science: How is this consistent with what has been said?</p>
<p>To this the answer is, that when this <em>has</em> been done with
advantage, the authority of external characters, as well as of
chemical constitution, has really been brought into play. We have two
sets of properties to compare, chemical and physical; to exhibit the
connexion of these is the object of scientific mineralogy. And though
this connexion would be most distinctly asserted, if we could keep the
two sets of properties distinct, yet it may be brought into view in a
great degree, by classifications in which both are referred to as
guides. Since the governing principle of the attempts at
classification is the conviction that the chemical constitution and
the physical properties have a definite relation to each other, we
appear entitled to use both kinds of evidence, in proportion as we can
best obtain each; and then the general consistency and convenience of
our system will be the security for its containing substantial
knowledge, though this be not presented in a rigorously logical or
systematic form.</p>
<p>Such <i>mixed systems</i> of classification, resting partly on
chemical and partly on physical characters, naturally appeared as the
earliest attempts in this way, before the two members of the subject
had been clearly separated in men’s minds; and these systems,
therefore, we must first give an account of.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Mixed Systems of Classification.</i></h4>
<p><i>Early Systems.</i>&#8212;The first attempts at classifying
minerals went upon the ground of those differences of general aspect
which had been <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page341">341</a></span>
recognized in the formation of common language; as <i>earths</i>,
<i>stones</i>, <i>metals</i>. But such arrangements were manifestly
vague and confused; and when chemistry had advanced to power and
honor, her aid was naturally called in to introduce a better order.
“Hiarne and Bromell were, as far as I know,” says<a id="fnanchor40-15"
href="#note40-15"><span class="fnanchor">40</span></a> Cronstedt, “the
first who founded any mineral system upon chemical principles; to them
we owe the three known divisions of the most simple mineral bodies;
viz., the <i>calcarei</i>, <i>vitrescentes</i>, and <i>apyri</i>.” But
Cronstedt’s own <i>Essay towards a System of Mineralogy</i>, published
in Swedish in 1758, had perhaps more influence than any other, upon
succeeding systems. In this, the distinction of earths and stones, and
also of vitrescent and non-vitrescent earths (<i>apyri</i>), is
rejected. The earths are classed as <i>calcareous</i>,
<i>siliceous</i>, <i>argillaceous</i>, and the like. Again, calcareous
earth is pure (<i>calc spar</i>), or united with acid of vitriol
(<i>gypsum</i>), or united with the muriatic add (<i>sal
ammoniac</i>), and the like. It is easy to see that this is the
method, which, in its general principle, has been continued to our own
time. In such methods, it is supposed that we can recognize the
substance by its general appearance, and on this assumption, its place
in the system conveys to us chemical knowledge concerning it.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note40-15"
href="#fnanchor40-15">40</a></span> <i>Mineralogy</i>, Pref. p.
viii.</div>
<p>But as the other branches of Natural History, and especially
Botany, assumed a systematic form, many mineralogists became
dissatisfied with this casual and superficial mode of taking account
of external characters; they became convinced, that in Mineralogy as
in other sciences, classification must have its system and its rules.
The views which Werner ascribes to his teacher, Pabst van Ohain,<a
id="fnanchor41-15" href="#note41-15"><span
class="fnanchor">41</span></a> show the rise of those opinions which
led through Werner to Mohs: “He was of opinion that a natural mineral
system must be constructed by chemical determinations, and external
characters at the same time (<i>methodus mixta</i>); but that along
with this, mineralogists ought also to construct and employ what he
called an <i>artificial system</i>, which might serve us as a guide
(<i>loco indicis</i>) how to introduce newly-discovered fossils into
the system, and how to find easily and quickly those already known and
introduced.” Such an artificial system, containing not the grounds of
classification, but marks for recognition, was afterwards attempted by
Mohs, and termed by him the <i>Characteristic</i> of his system.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note41-15"
href="#fnanchor41-15">41</a></span> Frisch. <i>Werner’s Leben</i>, p.
15.</div>
<p><i>Werner’s System.</i>&#8212;But, in the mean time, Werner’s
classification had an extensive reign, and this was still a mixed
system. Werner himself, indeed, never published a system of
mineralogy. “We might <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page342">342</a></span> almost imagine,” Cuvier says,<a
id="fnanchor42-15" href="#note42-15"><span
class="fnanchor">42</span></a> “that when he had produced his
nomenclature of external characters, he was affrighted with his own
creation; and that the reason of his writing so little after his first
essay, was to avoid the shackles which he had imposed upon others.”
His system was, indeed, made known both in and out of Germany, by his
pupils; but in consequence of Werner’s unwillingness to give it on his
own authority, it assumed, in its published forms, the appearance of
an extorted secret imperfectly told. A <i>Notice of the Mineralogical
Cabinet of Mine-Director Pabst von Ohain</i>, was, in 1792, published
by Karsten and Hoffman, under Werner’s direction; and conveyed by
example, his views of mineralogical arrangement; and<a
id="fnanchor43-15" href="#note43-15"><span
class="fnanchor">43</span></a> in 1816 his <i>Doctrine of
Classification</i> was surreptitiously copied from his manuscript, and
published in a German Journal, termed <i>The Hesperus</i>. But it was
only in 1817, after his death, that there appeared <i>Werner’s Last
Mineral System</i>, edited from his papers by Breithaupt and Köhler:
and by this time, as we shall soon see, other systems were coming
forwards on the stage.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note42-15"
href="#fnanchor42-15">42</a></span> Cuv. <i>El.</i> ii. 314.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note43-15"
href="#fnanchor43-15">43</a></span> Frisch. p. 52.</div>
<p>A very slight notice of Werner’s arrangement will suffice to show
that it was, as we have termed it, a Mixed System. He makes four great
Classes of fossils, <i>Earthy</i>, <i>Saline</i>, <i>Combustible</i>,
<i>Metallic</i>: the earthy fossils are in eight Genera&#8212;Diamond,
Zircon, Silica, Alumina, Talc, Lime, Baryta, Hallites. It is clear
that these genera are in the main chemical, for chemistry alone can
definitely distinguish the different Earths which characterize them.
Yet the Wernerian arrangement supposed the distinctions to be
practically made by reference to those external characters which the
teacher himself could employ with such surpassing skill. And though it
cannot be doubted, that the chemical views which prevailed around him
had a latent influence on his classification in some cases, he
resolutely refused to bend his system to the authority of chemistry.
Thus,<a id="fnanchor44-15" href="#note44-15"><span
class="fnanchor">44</span></a> when he was blamed for having, in
opposition to the chemists, placed diamond among the earthy fossils,
he persisted in declaring that, mineralogically considered, it was a
stone, and could not be treated as anything else.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note44-15"
href="#fnanchor44-15">44</a></span> Frisch. p. 62.</div>
<p>This was an indication to that tendency, which, under his
successor, led to a complete separation of the two grounds of
classification. But before we proceed to this, we must notice what was
doing at this period in other parts of Europe.</p>
<p><i>Haüy’s System.</i>&#8212;Though Werner, on his own principles,
ought to <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page343">343</a></span> have
been the first person to see the immense value of the most marked of
external characters, crystalline form, he did not, in fact, attach
much importance to it. Perhaps he was in some measure fascinated by a
fondness for those characters which he had himself systematized, and
the study of which did not direct him to look for geometrical
relations. However this may be, the glory of giving to Crystallography
its just importance in Mineralogy is due to France: and the Treatise
of Haüy, published in 1801, is the basis of the best succeeding works
of mineralogy. In this work, the arrangement is professedly chemical;
and the classification thus established is employed as the means of
enunciating crystallographic and other properties. “The principal
object of this Treatise,” says the author,<a id="fnanchor45-15"
href="#note45-15"><span class="fnanchor">45</span></a> “is the
exposition and development of a method founded on certain principles,
which may serve as a frame-work for all the knowledge which Mineralogy
can supply, aided by the different sciences which can join hands with
her and march on the same line.<span class="correction" title="omitted
in text">”</span> It is worthy of notice, as characteristic of this
period of Mixed Systems, that the classification of Haüy, though
founded on principles so different from the Wernerian ones, deviates
little from it in the general character of the divisions. Thus, the
first Order of the first Class of Haüy is <i>Acidiferous Earthy
Substances</i>; the first genus is <i>Lime</i>; the species are,
<i>Carbonate of Lime</i>, <i>Phosphate of Lime</i>, <i>Fluate of
Lime</i>, <i>Sulphate of Lime</i>, and so on.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note45-15"
href="#fnanchor45-15">45</a></span> Disc. Prél. p. xvii.</div>
<p><i>Other Systems.</i>&#8212;Such mixed methods were introduced also
into this country, and have prevailed, we may say, up to the present
time. The <i>Mineralogy</i> of William Phillips, which was published
in 1824, and which was an extraordinary treasure of crystallographic
facts, was arranged by such a mixed system; that is, by a system
professedly chemical; but, inasmuch as a rigid chemical system is
impossible, and the assumption of such a one leads into glaring
absurdities, the system was, in this and other attempts of the same
kind, corrected by the most arbitrary and lax application of other
considerations.</p>
<p>It is a curious example of the difference of national intellectual
character, that the manifest inconsistencies of the prevalent systems,
which led in Germany, as we shall see, to bold and sweeping attempts
at reform, produced in England a sort of contemptuous despair with
regard to systems in general;&#8212;a belief that no system could be
consistent or useful;&#8212;and a persuasion that the only valuable
knowledge is the accumulation of particular facts. This is not the
place to <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page344">344</a></span>
explain how erroneous and unphilosophical such an opinion is. But we
may notice that while such a temper prevails among us, our place in
this science can never be found in advance of that position which we
are now considering as exemplified in the period of Werner and Haüy.
So long as we entertain such views respecting the objects of
Mineralogy, we can have no share in the fortunes of the succeeding
period of its history, to which I now proceed.</p>

Mohs.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> chemical principle of
classification, if pursued at random, as in the cases just spoken of
leads to results at which a philosophical spirit revolts; it separates
widely substances which are not distinguishable; joins together bodies
the most dissimilar; and in hardly any instance does it bring any
truth into view. The vices of classifications like that of Haüy could
not long be concealed; but even before time had exposed the weakness
of his system, Haüy himself had pointed out, clearly and without
reserve,<a id="fnanchor46-15" href="#note46-15"><span
class="fnanchor">46</span></a> that a chemical system is only one side
of the subject, and supposes, as its counterpart, a science of
external characters. In the mean time, the Wernerians were becoming
more and more in love with the form which they had given to such a
science. Indeed, the expertness which Werner and his scholars acquired
in the use of external characters, justified some partiality for them.
It is related of him,<a id="fnanchor47-15" href="#note47-15"><span
class="fnanchor">47</span></a> that, by looking at a piece of
iron-ore, and poising it in his hand, he was able to tell, almost
precisely, the proportion of pure metal which it contained. And in the
last year of his life,<a id="fnanchor48-15" href="#note48-15"><span
class="fnanchor">48</span></a> he had marked out, as the employment of
the ensuing winter, the study of the system of Berzelius, with a view
to find out the laws of combination as disclosed by external
characters. In the same spirit, his pupil <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page345">345</a></span> Breithaupt<a id="fnanchor49-15"
href="#note49-15"><span class="fnanchor">49</span></a> attempted to
discover the ingredients of minerals by their peculiarities of
crystallization. The persuasion that there must be <em>some</em>
connexion between composition and properties, transformed itself, in
their minds, into a belief that they could seize the nature of the
connexion by a sort of instinct.</p>

<p>This opinion of the independency of the science of external
characters, and of its sufficiency for its own object, at last assumed
its complete form in the bold attempt to construct a system which
should borrow nothing from chemistry. This attempt was made by
Frederick Mohs, who had been the pupil of Werner, and was afterwards
his successor in the school of Freiberg; and who, by the acute and
methodical character of his intellect, and by his intimate knowledge
of minerals, was worthy of his predecessor. Rejecting altogether all
divisions of which the import was chemical, Mohs turned for guidance,
or at least for the light of analogy, to botany. His object was to
construct a <i>Natural System</i> of mineralogy. What the conditions
and advantages of a natural system of any province of nature are, we
must delay to explain till we have before us, in botany, a more
luminous example of such a scheme. But further; in mineralogy, as in
botany, besides the Natural System, by which we <em>form</em> our
classes, it is necessary to have an <i>Artificial System</i> by which
we <em>recognize</em> them;&#8212;a principle which, we have seen, had
already taken root in the school of Freiberg. Such an artificial
system Mohs produced in his <i>Characteristic of the Mineral
Kingdom</i>, which was published at Dresden in 1820; and which, though
extending only to a few pages, excited a strong interest in Germany,
where men’s minds were prepared to interpret the full import of such a
work. Some of the traits of such a “Characteristic” had, indeed, been
previously drawn by others; as for example, by Haüy, who notices that
each of his Classes has peculiar characters. For instance, his First
Class (acidiferous substances,) alone possesses these combinations of
properties; “division into a regular octohedron, without being able to
scratch glass; specific gravity above 3·5, without being able to
scratch glass.” The extension of such characters into a scheme which
should exhaust the whole mineral kingdom, was the undertaking of
Mohs.</p>
<p>Such a collection of marks of classes, implied a classification
previously established, and accordingly, Mohs had created his own
mineral system. His aim was to construct it, as we shall hereafter see
that other natural systems are constructed, by taking into account
<em>all</em> the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page346">346</a></span> resemblances and differences of the
objects classified. It is obvious that to execute such a work, implied
a most intimate and universal acquaintance with minerals;&#8212;a
power of combining in one vivid survey the whole mineral kingdom. To
illustrate the spirit in which Professor Mohs performed his task, I
hope I may be allowed to refer to my own intercourse with him. At an
early period of my mineralogical studies, when the very conception of
a Natural System was new to me, he, with great kindliness of temper,
allowed me habitually to propose to him the scruples which arose in my
mind, before I could admit principles which appeared to me then so
vague and indefinite; and answered my objections with great patience
and most instructive clearness. Among other difficulties, I one day
propounded to him this;&#8212;“You have published a Treatise on
Mineralogy, in which you have described <em>all</em> the important
properties of all known minerals. On your principles, then, it ought
to be possible, merely by knowing the descriptions in your book, and
without seeing any minerals, to construct a natural system; and this
natural system ought to turn out identical with that which you have
produced, by so careful an examination of the minerals themselves.” He
pondered a moment, and then he answered, “It is true; but what an
enormous <em>imagination</em> (<i>einbildungskraft</i>, <i>power of
inward imagining</i>), a man must have for such a work!” Vividness of
conception of sensible properties, and the steady intuition
(<i>anschauung</i>) of objects, were deemed by him, and by the
Wernerian school in general, to be the most essential conditions of
complete knowledge.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to describe Mohs’s system in detail; it may
sufficiently indicate its form to state that the following substances,
such as I before gave as examples of other arrangements, calcspar,
gypsum, fluor spar, apatite, heavy spar, are by Mohs termed
respectively, <i>Rhombohedral Lime Haloide</i>, <i>Gyps Haloide</i>,
<i>Octohedral Fluor Haloide</i>, <i>Rhombohedral Fluor Haloide</i>,
<i>Prismatic Hal Baryte</i>. These substances are thus referred to the
<i>Orders</i> Haloide, and Baryte; to <i>Genera</i> Lime Haloide,
Fluor Haloide, Hal Baryte; and the <i>Species</i> is an additional
particularization.</p>
<p>Mohs not only aimed at framing such a system, but was also
ambitious of giving to all minerals <i>Names</i> which should accord
with the system. This design was too bold to succeed. It is true, that
a new nomenclature was much needed in mineralogy: it is true, too,
that it was reasonable to expect, from an improved classification, an
improved nomenclature, such as had been so happily obtained in botany
by the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page347">347</a></span> reform
of Linnæus. But besides the defects of Mohs’s system, he had not
prepared his verbal novelties with the temperance and skill of the
great botanical reformer. He called upon mineralogists to change the
name of almost every mineral with which they were acquainted; and the
proposed appellations were mostly of a cumbrous form, as the above
example may serve to show. Such names could have obtained general
currency, only after a general and complete acceptance of the system;
and the system did not possess, in a sufficient degree, that evidence
which alone could gain it a home in the belief of
philosophers,&#8212;the coincidence of its results with those of
Chemistry. But before I speak finally of the fortunes of the
Natural-history System, I will say something of the other attempt
which was made about the same time to introduce a Reform into
Mineralogy from the opposite extremity of the science.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Chemical System of Berzelius and
others.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">If</span> the students of external
characters were satisfied of the independence of their method, the
chemical analysts were naturally no less confident of the legitimate
supremacy of their principles: and when the beginning of the present
century had been distinguished by the establishment of the theory of
definite proportions, and by discoveries which pointed to the
electro-chemical theory, it could not appear presumption to suppose,
that the classification of bodies, so far as it depended on chemistry,
might be presented in a form more complete and scientific than at any
previous time.</p>
<p>The attempt to do this was made by the great Swedish chemist Jacob
Berzelius. In 1816, he published his <i>Essay to establish a purely
Scientific System of Mineralogy, by means of the Application of the
Electro-chemical Theory and the Chemical Doctrine of Definite
Proportions</i>. It is manifest that, for minerals which are
constituted by the law of Definite Proportions, this constitution must
be a most essential part of their character. The electro-chemical
theory was called in aid, in addition to the composition, because,
distinguishing the elements of all compounds as electro-positive and
electro-negative, and giving to every element a place in a series, and
a place defined by the degree of these relations, it seemed to afford
a rigorous and complete principle of arrangement. Accordingly,
Berzelius, in his First System, arranged minerals according to their
electro-positive element, and the elements according to their
electro-positive rank; <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page348">348</a></span> and supposed that he had thus removed
all that was arbitrary and vague in the previous chemical systems of
mineralogy.</p>
<p>Though the attempt appeared so well justified by the state of
chemical science, and was so plausible in its principle, it was not
long before events showed that there was some fallacy in these
specious appearances. In 1820, Mitscherlich discovered Isomorphism: by
that discovery it appeared that bodies containing very different
electro-positive elements could not be distinguished from each other;
it was impossible, therefore, to put them in distant portions of the
classification;&#8212;and thus the first system of Berzelius crumbled
to pieces.</p>
<p>But Berzelius did not so easily resign his project. With the most
unhesitating confession of his first failure, but with undaunted
courage, he again girded himself to the task of rebuilding his
edifice. Defeated at the electro-positive position, he now resolved to
make a stand at the electro-negative element. In 1824, he published in
the Transactions of the Swedish Academy, a Memoir <i>On the
Alterations in the Chemical Mineral System, which necessarily follow
from the Property exhibited by Isomorphous Bodies, of replacing each
other in given Proportions</i>. The alteration was, in fact, an
inversion of the system, with an attempt still to preserve the
electro-chemical principle of arrangement. Thus, instead of arranging
metallic minerals according to the <em>metal</em>, under iron, copper,
&amp;c., all the <em>sulphurets</em> were classed together, all the
<em>oxides</em> together, all the <em>sulphates</em> together, and so
in other respects. That such an order was a great improvement on the
preceding one, cannot be doubted; but we shall see, I think, that as a
strict scientific system it was not successful. The discovery of
isomorphism, however, naturally led to such attempts. Thus Gmelin
also, in 1825, published a mineral system,<a id="fnanchor50-15"
href="#note50-15"><span class="fnanchor">50</span></a> which, like
that of Berzelius, founded its leading distinctions on the
electro-negative, or, as it was sometimes termed, the <i>formative</i>
element of bodies; and, besides this, took account of the
<em>numbers</em> of atoms or proportions which appear in the
composition of the body; distinguishing, for instance, Silicates, as
simple silicates, double silicates, and so on, to <em>quintuple</em>
silicate (<i>Pechstein</i>) and <em>sextuple</em> silicate
(<i>Perlstein</i>). In like manner, Nordenskiöld devised a system
resting on the same bases, taking into account also the crystalline
form. In 1824, Beudant published his <i>Traité Elémentaire de
Minéralogie</i>, in which he professes to found his arrangement on the
electro-negative element, and on Ampère’s circular <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page349">349</a></span> arrangement of
elementary substances. Such schemes exhibit rather a play of the mere
logical faculty, exercising itself on assumed principles, than any
attempt at the real interpretation of nature. Other such pure chemical
systems may have been published, but it is not necessary to accumulate
instances. I proceed to consider their result.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Failure of the Attempts at Systematic
Reform.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">It</span> may appear presumptuous to
speak of the failure of those whom, like Berzelius and Mohs, we
acknowledge as our masters, at a period when, probably, they and some
of their admirers still hold them to have succeeded in their attempt
to construct a consistent system. But I conceive that my office as an
historian requires me to exhibit the fortunes of this science in the
most distinct form of which they admit, and that I cannot evade the
duty of attempting to seize the true aspect of recent occurrences in
the world of science. Hence I venture to speak of the failure of both
the attempts at framing a pure scientific system of
mineralogy,&#8212;that founded on the chemical, and that founded on
the natural-history principle; because it is clear that they have not
obtained that which alone we could, according to the views here
presented, consider as success,&#8212;a coincidence of each with the
other. A Chemical System of arrangement, which should bring together,
in all cases, the substances which come nearest each other in external
properties;&#8212;a Natural-history System, which should be found to
arrange bodies in complete accordance with their chemical
constitution:&#8212;if such systems existed, they might, with justice,
claim to have succeeded. Their agreement would be their verification.
The interior and exterior system are the type and the antitype, and
their entire correspondence would establish the mode of interpretation
beyond doubt. But nothing less than this will satisfy the requisitions
of science. And when, therefore, the chemical and the natural-history
system, though evidently, as I conceive, tending towards each other,
are still far from coming together, it is impossible to allow that
either method has been successful in regard to its proper object.</p>
<p>But we may, I think, point out the fallacy of the principles, as
well as the imperfection of the results, of both of those methods.
With regard to that of Berzelius, indeed, the history of the subject
obviously betrays its unsoundness. The electro-positive principle was,
in a very short time after its adoption, proved and acknowledged to be
utterly untenable: what security have we that the electro-negative
element is <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page350">350</a></span> more
trustworthy? Was not the necessity of an entire change of system, a
proof that the ground, whatever that was, on which the
electro-chemical principle was adopted, was an unfounded assumption?
And, in fact, do we not find that the same argument which was allowed
to be fatal to the First System of Berzelius, applies in exactly the
same manner against the Second? If the electro-positive elements be
often isomorphous, are not the electro-negative elements sometimes
isomorphous also? for instance, the arsenic and phosphoric acids. But
to go further, what <em>is</em> the ground on which the
electro-chemical arrangement is adopted? Granted that the electrical
relations of bodies are important; but how do we come to know that
these relations have anything to do with mineralogy? How does it
appear that on them, principally, depend those external properties
which mineralogy must study? How does it appear that because sulphur
is the electro-negative part of one body, and an acid the
electro-negative part of another, these two elements similarly affect
the compounds? How does it appear that there is any analogy whatever
in their functions? We allow that the composition must, in <em>some
way</em>, determine the classified place of the mineral,&#8212;but why
in <em>this</em> way?</p>
<p>I do not dwell on the remark which Berzelius himself<a
id="fnanchor51-15" href="#note51-15"><span
class="fnanchor">51</span></a> makes on Nordenskiöld’s
system;&#8212;that it assumes a perfect knowledge of the composition
in every case; although, considering the usual discrepancies of
analyses of minerals, this objection must make all pure chemical
systems useless. But I may observe, that mineralogists have not yet
determined what characters are sufficiently affixed to determine a
species of minerals. We have seen that the ancient notion of the
composition of a species, has been unsettled by the discovery of
isomorphism. The tenet of the constancy of the angle is rendered
doubtful by cases of plesiomorphism. The optical properties, which are
so closely connected with the crystalline, are still so imperfectly
known, that they are subject to changes which appear capricious and
arbitrary. Both the chemical and the optical mineralogists have
constantly, of late, found occasion to separate species which had been
united, and to bring together those which had been divided. Everything
shows that, in this science, we have our classification still to
begin. The detection of that fixity of characters, on which a right
establishment of species must rest, is not yet complete, great as the
progress is which we have made, by acquiring a knowledge of the laws
of crystallization and of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page351">351</a></span> definite chemical constitution. Our
ignorance may surprise us; but it may diminish our surprise to
recollect, that the knowledge which we seek is that of the laws of the
physical constitution of all bodies whatever; for to us, as
mineralogists, all chemical compounds are minerals.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note51-15"
href="#fnanchor51-15">51</a></span> <i>Jahres Bericht.</i> viii.
188.</div>
<p>The defect of the principle of the natural-history classifiers may
be thus stated:&#8212;in studying the external characters of bodies,
they take for granted that they can, without any other light, discover
the relative value and importance of those characters. The grouping of
Species into a Genus, of Genera into an Order, according to the method
of this school, proceeds by no definite rules, but by a latent talent
of appreciation,&#8212;a sort of classifying instinct. But this course
cannot reasonably be expected to lead to scientific truth; for it can
hardly be hoped, by any one who looks at the general course of
science, that we shall discover the relation between external
characters and chemical composition, otherwise than by tracing their
association in cases where both are known. It is urged that in other
classificatory sciences, in botany, for example, we obtain a natural
classification from external characters without having recourse to any
other source of knowledge. But this is not true in the sense here
meant. In framing a natural system of botany, we have constantly
before our eyes the principles of physiology; and we estimate the
value of the characters of a plant by their bearing on its
functions,&#8212;by their place in its organization. In an unorganic
body, the chemical constitution is the law of its being; and we shall
never succeed in framing a science of such bodies but by studiously
directing our efforts to the interpretation of that law.</p>
<p>On these grounds, then, I conceive, that the bold attempts of Mohs
and of Berzelius to give new forms to mineralogy, cannot be deemed
successful in the manner in which their authors aspired to succeed.
Neither of them can be marked as a permanent reformation of the
science. I shall not inquire how far they have been accepted by men of
science, for I conceive that their greatest effect has been to point
out improvements which might be made in mineralogy without going the
whole length either of the <em>pure</em> chemical, or of the
<em>pure</em> natural-history system.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 4.&#8212;<i>Return to Mixed Systems with
Improvements.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">In</span> spite of the efforts of
the purists, mineralogists returned to mixed systems of
classification; but these systems are much better than they were
before such efforts were made. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page352">352</a></span></p>
<p>The Second System of Berzelius, though not tenable in its rigorous
form, approaches far nearer than any previous system to a complete
character, bringing together like substances in a large portion of its
extent. The System of Mohs also, whether or not unconsciously swayed
by chemical doctrines, forms orders which have a community of chemical
character; thus, the minerals of the order <i>Haloide</i> are salts of
oxides, and those of the order <i>Pyrites</i> are sulphurets of
metals. Thus the two methods appear to be converging to a common
centre; and though we are unable to follow either of them to this
point of union, we may learn from both in what direction we are to
look for it. If we regard the best of the pure systems hitherto
devised as indications of the nature of that system, perfect both as a
chemical and as a natural-history system, to which a more complete
condition of mineralogical knowledge may lead us, we may obtain, even
at present, a tolerably good approximation to a complete
classification; and such a one, if we recollect that it must be
imperfect, and is to be held as provisional only, may be of no small
value and use to us.</p>
<p>The best of the mixed systems produced by this compromise again
comes from Freiberg, and was published by Professor Naumann in 1828.
Most of his orders have both a chemical character and great external
resemblances. Thus his <i>Haloides</i>, divided into <i>Unmetallic</i>
and <i>Metallic</i>, and these again into <i>Hydrous</i> and
<i>Anhydrous</i>, give good natural groups. The most difficult
minerals to arrange in all systems are the siliceous ones. These M.
Naumann calls <i>Silicides</i>, and subdivides them into
<i>Metallic</i>, <i>Unmetallic</i>, and <i>Amphoteric</i> or mixed;
and again, into <i>Hydrous</i> and <i>Anhydrous</i>. Such a system is
at least a good basis for future researches; and this is, as we have
said, all that we can at present hope for. And when we recollect that
the natural-history principle of classification has begun, as we have
already seen, to make its appearance in our treatises of chemistry, we
cannot doubt that some progress is making towards the object which I
have pointed out. But we know not yet how far we are from the end. The
combination of chemical, crystallographical, physical and optical
properties into some lofty generalization, is probably a triumph
reserved for future and distant years.</p>
<p><i>Conclusion.</i>&#8212;The history of Mineralogy, both in its
successes and by its failures, teaches us this lesson;&#8212;that in
the sciences of classification, the establishment of the fixity of
characters, and the discovery of such characters as are fixed, are
steps of the first importance in the progress of these sciences. The
recollection of this maxim may aid us in <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page353">353</a></span> shaping our course through the history
of other sciences of this kind; in which, from the extent of the
subject, and the mass of literature belonging to it, we might at first
almost despair of casting the history into distinct epochs and
periods. To the most prominent of such sciences, Botany, I now
proceed.</p>

<h3 class="space-above">INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">WE</span> now arrive at that study
which offers the most copious and complete example of the sciences of
classification, I mean Botany. And in this case, we have before us a
branch of knowledge of which we may say, more properly than of any of
the sciences which we have reviewed since Astronomy, that it has been
constantly advancing, more or less rapidly, from the infancy of the
human race to the present day. One of the reasons of this resemblance
in the fortunes of two studies so widely dissimilar, is to be found in
a simplicity of principle which they have in common; the ideas of
Likeness and Difference, on which the knowledge of plants depends,
are, like the ideas of Space and Time, which are the foundation of
astronomy, readily apprehended with clearness and precision, even
without any peculiar culture of the intellect. But another reason why,
in the history of Botany, as in that of Astronomy, the progress of
knowledge forms an unbroken line from the earliest times, is precisely
the great difference of the kind of knowledge which has been attained
in the two cases. In Astronomy, the discovery of general truths began
at an early period of civilization; in Botany, it has hardly yet
begun; and thus, in each of these departments of study, the lore of
the ancient is homogeneous with that of the modern times, though in
the one case it is science, in the other, the absence of science,
which pervades all ages. The resemblance of the form of their history
arises from the diversity of their materials.</p>
<p>I shall not here dwell further upon this subject, but proceed to
trace rapidly the progress of <i>Systematic Botany</i>, as the
classificatory science is usually denominated, when it is requisite to
distinguish between that and Physiological Botany. My own imperfect
acquaintance with this study admonishes me not to venture into its
details, further than my purpose absolutely requires. I trust that, by
taking my views principally from writers who are generally allowed to
possess the best insight into the science, I may be able to draw the
larger features of its history with tolerable correctness; and if I
succeed in this, I shall attain an object of great importance in my
general scheme. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page358">358</a></span></p>
<h3 class="space-above">CHAPTER I.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Imaginary Knowledge of Plants.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> apprehension of such
differences and resemblances as those by which we group together and
discriminate the various kinds of plants and animals, and the
appropriation of words to mark and convey the resulting notions, must
be presupposed, as essential to the very beginning of human knowledge.
In whatever manner we imagine man to be placed on the earth by his
Creator, these processes must be conceived to be, as our Scriptures
represent them, contemporaneous with the first exertion of reason, and
the first use of speech. If we were to indulge ourselves in framing a
hypothetical account of the origin of language, we should probably
assume as the first-formed words, those which depend on the visible
likeness or unlikeness of objects; and should arrange as of subsequent
formation, those terms which imply, in the mind, acts of wider
combination and higher abstraction. At any rate, it is certain that
the names of the kinds of vegetables and animals are very abundant
even in the most uncivilized stages of man’s career. Thus we are
informed<a id="fnanchor1-16" href="#note1-16"><span
class="fnanchor">1</span></a> that the inhabitants of New Zealand have
a distinct name of every tree and plant in their island, of which
there are six or seven hundred or more different kinds. In the
accounts of the rudest tribes, in the earliest legends, poetry, and
literature of nations, pines and oaks, roses and violets, the olive
and the vine, and the thousand other productions of the earth, have a
place, and are spoken of in a manner which assumes, that in such kinds
of natural objects, permanent and infallible distinctions had been
observed and universally recognized.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-16"
href="#fnanchor1-16">1</a></span> Yate’s <i>New Zealand</i>, p.
238.</div>
<p>For a long period, it was not suspected that any ambiguity or
confusion could arise from the use of such terms; and when such
inconveniences did occur, (as even in early times they did,) men were
far from divining that the proper remedy was the construction of a
science of classification. The loose and insecure terms of the
language of common life retained their place in botany, long after
their <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page359">359</a></span> defects
were severely felt: for instance, the vague and unscientific
distinction of vegetables into <i>trees</i>, <i>shrubs</i>, and
<i>herbs</i>, kept its ground till the time of Linnæus.</p>
<p>While it was thus imagined that the identification of a plant, by
means of its name, might properly be trusted to the common uncultured
faculties of the mind, and to what we may call the instinct of
language, all the attention and study which were bestowed on such
objects, were naturally employed in learning and thinking upon such
circumstances respecting them as were supplied by any of the common
channels through which knowledge and opinion flow into men’s
minds.</p>
<p>The reader need hardly be reminded that in the earlier periods of
man’s mental culture, he acquires those opinions on which he loves to
dwell, not by the exercise of observation subordinate to reason; but,
far more, by his fancy and his emotions, his love of the marvellous,
his hopes and fears. It cannot surprise us, therefore, that the
earliest lore concerning plants which we discover in the records of
the past, consists of mythological legends, marvellous relations, and
extraordinary medicinal qualities. To the lively fancy of the Greeks,
the Narcissus, which bends its head over the stream, was originally a
youth who in such an attitude became enamored of his own beauty: the
hyacinth,<a id="fnanchor2-16" href="#note2-16"><span
class="fnanchor">2</span></a> on whose petals the notes of grief were
traced (<span class="sc">a i, a i</span>), recorded the sorrow of
Apollo for the death of his favorite Hyacinthus: the beautiful lotus
of India,<a id="fnanchor3-16" href="#note3-16"><span
class="fnanchor">3</span></a> which floats with its splendid flower on
the surface of the water, is the chosen seat of the goddess Lackshmi,
the daughter of Ocean.<a id="fnanchor4-16" href="#note4-16"><span
class="fnanchor">4</span></a> In Egypt, too,<a id="fnanchor5-16"
href="#note5-16"><span class="fnanchor">5</span></a> Osiris swam on a
lotus-leaf and Harpocrates was cradled in one. The lotus-eaters of
Homer lost immediately their love of home. Every one knows how easy it
would be to accumulate such tales of wonder or religion.</p>

<p>Those who attended to the effects of plants, might discover in them
some medicinal properties, and might easily imagine more; and when the
love of the marvellous was added to the hope of health, it is easy to
believe that men would be very credulous. We need not dwell upon the
examples of this. In Pliny’s Introduction to that book of his <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page360">360</a></span> Natural History which
treats of the medicinal virtues of plants, he says,<a
id="fnanchor6-16" href="#note6-16"><span class="fnanchor">6</span></a>
“Antiquity was so much struck with the properties of herbs, that it
affirmed things incredible. Xanthus, the historian, says, that a man
killed by a dragon, will be restored to life by an herb which he calls
<i>balin</i>; and that Thylo, when killed by a dragon, was recovered
by the same plant. Democritus asserted, and Theophrastus believed,
that there was an herb, at the touch of which, the wedge which the
woodman had driven into a tree would leap out again. Though we cannot
credit these stories, most persons believe that almost anything might
be effected by means of herbs, if their virtues were fully known.” How
far from a reasonable estimate of the reality of such virtues were the
persons who entertained this belief we may judge from the many
superstitious observances which they associated with the gathering and
using of medicinal plants. Theophrastus speaks of these;<a
id="fnanchor7-16" href="#note7-16"><span class="fnanchor">7</span></a>
“The drug-sellers and the rhizotomists (root-cutters) tell us,” he
says, “some things which may be true, but other things which are
merely solemn quackery;<a id="fnanchor8-16" href="#note8-16"><span
class="fnanchor">8</span></a> thus they direct us to gather some
plants, standing from the wind, and with our bodies anointed; some by
night, some by day, some before the sun falls on them. So far there
may be something in their rules. But others are too fantastical and
far fetched. It is, perhaps, not absurd to use a prayer in plucking a
plant; but they go further than this. We are to draw a sword three
times round the mandragora, and to cut it looking to the west: again,
to dance round it, and to use obscene language, as they say those who
sow cumin should utter blasphemies. Again, we are to draw a line round
the black hellebore, standing to the east and praying; and to avoid an
eagle either on the right or on the left; for, say they, ‘if an eagle
be near, the cutter will die in a year.’”</p>

<p>This extract may serve to show the extent to which these
imaginations were prevalent, and the manner in which they were looked
upon by Theophrastus, our first great botanical author. And we may now
consider that we have given sufficient attention to these fables and
superstitions, which have no place in the history of the progress of
real knowledge, except to show the strange chaos of wild fancies and
legends out of which it had to emerge. We proceed to trace the history
of the knowledge of plants. <span class="pagenum"><a

<h3 class="space-above">CHAPTER II.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Unsystematic Knowledge of Plants.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">A STEP</span> was made towards the
formation of the Science of Plants, although undoubtedly a slight one,
as soon as men began to collect information concerning them and their
properties, from a love and reverence for knowledge, independent of
the passion for the marvellous and the impulse of practical utility.
This step was very early made. The “wisdom” of Solomon, and the
admiration which was bestowed upon it, prove, even at that period,
such a working of the speculative faculty: and we are told, that among
other evidences of his being “wiser than all men,” “he spake of trees,
from the cedar-tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that
springeth out of the wall.”<a id="fnanchor9-16" href="#note9-16"><span
class="fnanchor">9</span></a> The father of history, Herodotus, shows
us that a taste for natural history had, in his time, found a place in
the minds of the Greeks. In speaking of the luxuriant vegetation of
the Babylonian plain,<a id="fnanchor10-16" href="#note10-16"><span
class="fnanchor">10</span></a> he is so far from desiring to astonish
merely, that he says, “the blades of wheat and barley are full four
fingers wide; but as to the size of the trees which grow from millet
and sesame, though I could mention it, I will not; knowing well that
those who have not been in that country will hardly believe what I
have said already.” He then proceeds to describe some remarkable
circumstances respecting the fertilization of the date-palms in
Assyria.</p>

href="#fnanchor10-16">10</a></span> Herod. i. 193.</div>
<p>This curious and active spirit of the Greeks led rapidly, as we
have seen in other instances, to attempts at collecting and
systematizing knowledge on almost every subject: and in this, as in
almost every other department, Aristotle may be fixed upon, as the
representative of the highest stage of knowledge and system which they
ever attained. The vegetable kingdom, like every other province of
nature, was one of the fields of the labors of this universal
philosopher. But though his other works on natural history have come
down to us, and are a most valuable monument of the state of such
knowledge in his time, his Treatise on Plants is lost. The book <i>De
Plantis</i> <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page362">362</a></span>
which appears with his name, is an imposture of the middle ages, full
of errors and absurdities.<a id="fnanchor11-16"
href="#note11-16"><span class="fnanchor">11</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note11-16"
href="#fnanchor11-16">11</a></span> Mirbel, <i>Botanique</i>, ii.
505.</div>
<p>His disciple, friend, and successor, Theophrastus of Eresos, is, as
we have said already, the first great writer on botany whose works we
possess; and, as may be said in most cases of the first great writer,
he offers to us a richer store of genuine knowledge and good sense
than all his successors. But we find in him that the Greeks of his
time, who aspired, as we have said, to collect and
<em>systematize</em> a body of information on every subject, failed in
one half of their object, as far as related to the vegetable world.
Their attempts at a systematic distribution of plants were altogether
futile. Although Aristotle’s divisions of the animal kingdom are, even
at this day, looked upon with admiration by the best naturalists, the
arrangements and comparisons of plants which were contrived by
Theophrastus and his successors, have not left the slightest trace in
the modern form of the science; and, therefore, according to our plan,
are of no importance in our history. And thus we can treat all the
miscellaneous information concerning vegetables which was accumulated
by the whole of this school of writers, in no other way than as
something antecedent to the first progress towards systematic
knowledge.</p>
<p>The information thus collected by the unsystematic writers is of
various kinds; and relates to the economical and medicinal uses of
plants, their habits, mode of cultivation, and many other
circumstances: it frequently includes some description; but this is
always extremely imperfect, because the essential conditions of
description had not been discovered. Of works composed of materials so
heterogeneous, it can be of little use to produce specimens; but I may
quote a few words from Theophrastus, which may serve to connect him
with the future history of the science, as bearing upon one of the
many problems respecting the identification of ancient and modern
plants. It has been made a question whether the following description
does not refer to the potato.<a id="fnanchor12-16"
href="#note12-16"><span class="fnanchor">12</span></a> He is speaking
of the differences of roots: “Some roots,” he says, “are still
different from those which have been described; as that of the
<i>arachidna</i><a id="fnanchor13-16" href="#note13-16"><span
class="fnanchor">13</span></a> plant: for this bears fruit underground
as well as above: the fleshy part sends one thick root deep into the
ground, but the others, which bear the fruit, are more slender <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page363">363</a></span> and higher up, and
ramified. It loves a sandy soil, and has no leaf whatever.”</p>

<p>The books of Aristotle and Theophrastus soon took the place of the
Book of Nature in the attention of the degenerate philosophers who
succeeded them. A story is told by Strabo<a id="fnanchor14-16"
href="#note14-16"><span class="fnanchor">14</span></a> concerning the
fate of the works of these great naturalists. In the case of the wars
and changes which occurred among the successors of Alexander, the
heirs of Theophrastus tried to secure to themselves his books, and
those of his master, by burying them in the ground. There the
manuscripts suffered much from damp and worms; till Apollonicon, a
book-collector of those days, purchased them, and attempted, in his
own way, to supply what time had obliterated. When Sylla marched the
Roman troops into Athens, he took possession of the library of
Apollonicon; and the works which it contained were soon circulated
among the learned of Rome and Alexandria, who were thus enabled to
<i>Aristotelize</i><a id="fnanchor15-16" href="#note15-16"><span
class="fnanchor">15</span></a> on botany as on other subjects.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note14-16"

<p>The library collected by the Attalic kings of Pergamus, and the
Alexandrian Museum, founded and supported by the Ptolemies of Egypt,
rather fostered the commentatorial spirit than promoted the increase
of any real knowledge of nature. The Romans, in this as in other
subjects, were practical, not speculative. They had, in the times of
their national vigor, several writers on agriculture, who were highly
esteemed; but no author, till we come to Pliny, who dwells on the mere
knowledge of plants. And even in Pliny, it is easy to perceive that we
have before us a writer who extracted his information principally from
books. This remarkable man,<a id="fnanchor16-16"
href="#note16-16"><span class="fnanchor">16</span></a> in the middle
of a public and active life, of campaigns and voyages, contrived to
accumulate, by reading and study, an extraordinary store of knowledge
of all kinds. So unwilling was he to have his reading and note-making
interrupted, that, even before day-break in winter, and from his
litter as he travelled, he was wont to dictate to his amanuensis, who
was obliged to preserve his hand from the numbness which the cold
occasioned, by the use of gloves.<a id="fnanchor17-16"

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note17-16"
href="#fnanchor17-16">17</a></span> Plin. Jun. Epist. 3, 5.</div>
<p>It has been ingeniously observed, that we may find traces in the
botanical part of his Natural History, of the errors which this
hurried and broken habit of study produced; and that he appears
frequently to have had books read to him and to have heard them
amiss.<a id="fnanchor18-16" href="#note18-16"><span
class="fnanchor">18</span></a> Thus, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page364">364</a></span> among several other instances,
Theophrastus having said that the plane-tree is in Italy rare,<a
id="fnanchor19-16" href="#note19-16"><span
class="fnanchor">19</span></a> Pliny, misled by the similarity of the
Greek word (<i>spanian</i>, rare), says that the tree occurs in Italy
and Spain.<a id="fnanchor20-16" href="#note20-16"><span
class="fnanchor">20</span></a> His work has, with great propriety,
been called the Encyclopædia of Antiquity; and, in truth, there are
few portions of the learning of the times to which it does not refer.
Of the thirty-seven Books of which it consists, no less than sixteen
(from the twelfth to the twenty-seventh) relate to plants. The
information which is collected in these books, is of the most
miscellaneous kind; and the author admits, with little distinction,
truth and error, useful knowledge and absurd fables. The declamatory
style, and the comprehensive and lofty tone of thought which we have
already spoken of as characteristic of the Roman writers, are
peculiarly observable in him. The manner of his death is well known:
it was occasioned by the eruption of Vesuvius, <span
class="sc">a.d.</span> 79, to which, in his curiosity, he ventured so
near as to be suffocated.</p>

<p>Pliny’s work acquired an almost unlimited authority, as one of the
standards of botanical knowledge, in the middle ages; but even more
than his, that of his contemporary, Pedanius Dioscorides, of Anazarbus
in Cilicia. This work, written in Greek, is held by the best judges<a
id="fnanchor21-16" href="#note21-16"><span
class="fnanchor">21</span></a> to offer no evidence that the author
observed for himself. Yet he says expressly in his Preface, that his
love of natural history, and his military life, have led him into many
countries, in which he has had opportunity to become acquainted with
the nature of herbs and trees.<a id="fnanchor22-16"
href="#note22-16"><span class="fnanchor">22</span></a> He speaks of
six hundred plants, but often indicates only their names and
properties, giving no description by which they can be identified. The
main cause of his great reputation in subsequent times was, that he
says much of the medicinal virtues of vegetables.</p>

<p>We come now to the ages of darkness and lethargy, when the habit of
original thought seems to die away, as the talent of original
observation had done before. Commentators and mystics succeed to the
philosophical naturalists of better times. And though a new race,
altogether distinct in blood and character from the Greek,
appropriates to itself the stores of Grecian learning, this movement
does not, as might be expected, break the chains of literary slavery.
The Arabs <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page365">365</a></span>
bring, to the cultivation of the science of the Greeks, their own
oriental habit of submission, their oriental love of wonder; and thus,
while they swell the herd of commentators and mystics, they produce no
philosopher.</p>
<p>Yet the Arabs discharged an important function in the history of
human knowledge,<a id="fnanchor23-16" href="#note23-16"><span
class="fnanchor">23</span></a> by preserving, and transmitting to more
enlightened times, the intellectual treasures of antiquity. The
unhappy dissensions which took place in the Christian church had
scattered these treasures over the East, at a period much antecedent
to the rise of the Saracen power. In the fifth century, the adherents
of Nestorius, bishop of Constantinople, were declared heretical by the
Council of Ephesus (<span class="correction" title="in large capitals
in text"><span class="sc">a.d.</span></span> 431), and driven into
exile. In this manner, many of the most learned and ingenious men of
the Christian world were removed to the Euphrates, where they formed
the <i>Chaldean</i> church, erected the celebrated Nestorian school of
Edessa, and gave rise to many offsets from this in various regions.
Already, in the fifth century, Hibas, Cumas, and Probus, translated
the writings of Aristotle into Syriac. But the learned Nestorians paid
an especial attention to the art of medicine, and were the most
zealous students of the works of the Greek physicians. At Djondisabor,
in Khusistan, they became an ostensible medical school, who
distributed academical honors as the result of public disputations.
The califs of Bagdad heard of the fame and the wisdom of the doctors
of Djondisabor, summoned some of them to Bagdad, and took measures for
the foundation of a school of learning in that city. The value of the
skill, the learning, and the virtues of the Nestorians, was so
strongly felt, that they were allowed by the Mohammedans the free
exercise of the Christian religion, and intrusted with the conduct of
the studies of those of the Moslemin, whose education was most cared
for. The affinity of the Syriac and Arabic languages made the task of
instruction more easy. The Nestorians translated the works of the
ancients out of the former into the latter language: hence there are
still found Arabic manuscripts of Dioscorides, with Syriac words in
the margin. Pliny and Aristotle likewise assumed an Arabic dress; and
were, as well as Dioscorides, the foundation of instruction in all the
Arabian academies; of which a great number were established throughout
the Saracen empire, from Bokhara in the remotest east, to Marocco and
Cordova in the west. After some time, the Mohammedans themselves began
to translate and <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page366">366</a></span> extract from their Syriac sources; and
at length to write works of their own. And thus arose vast libraries,
such as that of Cordova, which contained 250,000 volumes.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note23-16"
href="#fnanchor23-16">23</a></span> Sprengel, i. 203.</div>
<p>The Nestorians are stated<a id="fnanchor24-16"
href="#note24-16"><span class="fnanchor">24</span></a> to have first
established among the Arabs those collections of medicinal substances
(<i>Apothecæ</i>), from which our term <i>Apothecary</i> is taken; and
to have written books (<i>Dispensatoria</i>) containing systematic
instructions for the employment of these medicaments; a word which
long continued to be implied in the same sense, and which we also
retain, though in a modified application (<i>Dispensary</i>).</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note24-16"
href="#fnanchor24-16">24</a></span> Sprengel, i. 205.</div>
<p>The directors of these collections were supposed to be intimately
acquainted with plants; and yet, in truth, the knowledge of plants
owed but little to them; for the Arabic Dioscorides was the source and
standard of their knowledge. The flourishing commerce of the Arabians,
their numerous and distant journeys, made them, no doubt, practically
acquainted with the productions of lands unknown to the Greeks and
Romans. Their Nestorian teachers had established Christianity even as
far as China and Malabar; and their travellers mention<a
id="fnanchor25-16" href="#note25-16"><span
class="fnanchor">25</span></a> the camphor of Sumatra, the aloe-wood
of Socotra near Java, the tea of China. But they never learned the art
of converting their practical into speculative knowledge. They treat
of plants only in so far as their use in medicine is concerned,<a
id="fnanchor26-16" href="#note26-16"><span
class="fnanchor">26</span></a> and followed Dioscorides in the
description, and even in the order of the plants, except when they
arrange them according to the Arabic alphabet. With little clearness
of view, they often mistake what they read:<a id="fnanchor27-16"
href="#note27-16"><span class="fnanchor">27</span></a> thus when
Dioscorides says that <i>ligusticon</i> grows on the <i>Apennine</i>,
a mountain not far from the <i>Alps</i>; Avicenna, misled by a
resemblance of the Arabic letters, quotes him as saying that the plant
grows on <i>Akabis</i>, a mountain near <i>Egypt</i>.</p>

<p>It is of little use to enumerate such writers. One of the most
noted of them was Mesuë, physician of the Calif of Kahirah. His work,
which was translated into Latin at a later period, was entitled, <i>On
Simple Medicines</i>; a title which was common to many medical
treatises, from the time of Galen in the second century. Indeed, of
this opposition of <i>simple</i> and <i>compound</i> medicines, we
still have traces in our language: <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page367">367</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">  He would ope his leathern scrip,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And show me <em>simples</em> of a thousand
names,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Telling their strange and vigorous
faculties.</span><br />
<p class="citation"><span class="sc">Milton</span>,
<i>Comus</i>.</p></div></div>
<p>Where the subject of our history is so entirely at a stand, it is
unprofitable to dwell on a list of names. The Arabians, small as their
science was, were able to instruct the Christians. Their writings were
translated by learned Europeans, for instance Michael Scot, and
Constantine of Africa, a Carthaginian who had lived forty years among
the Saracens<a id="fnanchor28-16" href="#note28-16"><span
class="fnanchor">28</span></a> and who died <span
class="sc">a.d.</span> 1087. Among his works, is a Treatise, <i>De
Gradibus</i>, which contains the Arabian medicinal lore. In the
thirteenth century occur Encyclopædias, as that of Albertus Magnus,
and of Vincent of Beauvais; but these contain no natural history
except traditions and fables. Even the ancient writers were altogether
perverted and disfigured. The Dioscorides of the middle ages varied
materially from ours.<a id="fnanchor29-16" href="#note29-16"><span
class="fnanchor">29</span></a> Monks, merchants, and adventurers
travelled far, but knowledge was little increased. Simon of Genoa,<a
id="fnanchor30-16" href="#note30-16"><span
class="fnanchor">30</span></a> a writer on plants in the fourteenth
century, boasts that he perambulated the East in order to collect
plants. “Yet in his <i>Clavis Sanationis</i>,” says a modern botanical
writer,<a id="fnanchor31-16" href="#note31-16"><span
class="fnanchor">31</span></a> “we discover no trace of an
acquaintance with nature. He merely compares the Greek, Arabic, and
Latin names of plants, and gives their medicinal effect after his
predecessors:”&#8212;so little true is it, that the use of the senses
alone necessarily leads to real knowledge.</p>

<p>Though the growing activity of thought in Europe, and the revived
acquaintance with the authors of Greece in their genuine form, were
gradually dispelling the intellectual clouds of the middle ages, yet
during the fifteenth century, botany makes no approach to a scientific
form. The greater part of the literature of this subject consisted of
Herbals, all of which were formed on the same plan, and appeared under
titles such as <i>Hortus</i>, or <i>Ortus Sanitatis</i>. There are,
for example, three<a id="fnanchor32-16" href="#note32-16"><span
class="fnanchor">32</span></a> such German Herbals, with woodcuts,
which date about 1490. But an important peculiarity in these works is
that they contain some indigenous species placed side by side with the
old ones. In 1516, <i>The Grete Herbal</i> was published in England,
also with woodcuts. It contains an account of more than four hundred
vegetables, and their <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page368">368</a></span> products; of which one hundred and fifty
are English, and are no way distinguished from the exotics by the mode
in which they are inserted in the work.</p>

<p>We shall see, in the next <a href="#v2page369">chapter</a>, that
when the intellect of Europe began really to apply itself to the
observation of nature, the progress towards genuine science soon began
to be visible, in this as in other subjects; but before this tendency
could operate freely, the history of botany was destined to show, in
another instance, how much more grateful to man, even when roused to
intelligence and activity, is the study of tradition than the study of
nature. When the scholars of Europe had become acquainted with the
genuine works of the ancients in the original languages, the pleasure
and admiration which they felt, led them to the most zealous endeavors
to illustrate and apply what they read. They fell into the error of
supposing that the plants described by Theophrastus, Dioscorides,
Pliny, must be those which grew in their own fields. And thus
Ruellius,<a id="fnanchor33-16" href="#note33-16"><span
class="fnanchor">33</span></a> a French physician, who only travelled
in the environs of Paris and Picardy, imagined that he found there the
plants of Italy and Greece. The originators of genuine botany in
Germany, Brunfels and Tragus (Bock), committed the same mistake; and
hence arose the misapplication of classical names to many genera. The
labors of many other learned men took the same direction, of treating
the ancient writers as if they alone were the sources of knowledge and
truth.</p>

<p>But the philosophical spirit of Europe was already too vigorous to
allow this superstitious erudition to exercise a lasting sway.
Leonicenus, who taught at Ferrara till he was almost a hundred years
old, and died in 1524,<a id="fnanchor34-16" href="#note34-16"><span
class="fnanchor">34</span></a> disputed, with great freedom, the
authority of the Arabian writers, and even of Pliny. He saw, and
showed by many examples, how little Pliny himself knew of nature, and
how many errors he had made or transmitted. The same independence of
thought with regard to other ancient writers, was manifested by other
scholars. Yet the power of ancient authority melted away but
gradually. Thus Antonius Brassavola, who established on the banks of
the Po the first botanical garden of modern times, published in 1536,
his <i>Examen omnium Simplicium Medicamentorum</i>; and, as Cuvier
says,<a id="fnanchor35-16" href="#note35-16"><span
class="fnanchor">35</span></a> though he studied plants in nature, his
book (written in the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page369">369</a></span> Platonic form of dialogue), has still
the character of a commentary on the ancients.</p>

<p>The Germans appear to have been the first to liberate themselves
from this thraldom, and to publish works founded mainly on actual
observation. The first of the botanists who had this great merit is
Otho Brunfels of Mentz, whose work, <i>Herbarum Vivæ Icones</i>,
appeared in 1530. It consists of two volumes in folio, with wood-cuts;
and in 1532, a German edition was published. The plants which it
contains are given without any arrangement, and thus he belongs to the
period of unsystematic knowledge. Yet the progress towards the
formation of a system manifested itself so immediately in the series
of German botanists to which he belongs, that we might with almost
equal propriety transfer him to the history of that progress; to which
we now proceed.</p>
<hr class="three space-above" />
<h3>CHAPTER III.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Formation of a System of Arrangement of
Plants.</span></h3>
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Prelude to the Epoch of
Cæsalpinus.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> arrangement of plants in
the earliest works was either arbitrary, or according to their use, or
some other extraneous circumstance, as in Pliny. This and the division
of vegetables by Dioscorides into <i>aromatic</i>, <i>alimentary</i>,
<i>medicinal</i>, <i>vinous</i>, is, as will be easily seen, a merely
casual distribution. The Arabian writers, and those of the middle
ages, showed still more clearly their insensibility to the nature of
system, by adopting an alphabetical arrangement; which was employed
also in the Herbals of the sixteenth century. Brunfels, as we have
said, adopted no principle of order; nor did his successor, Fuchs. Yet
the latter writer urged his countrymen to put aside their Arabian and
barbarous Latin doctors, and to observe the vegetable kingdom for
themselves; and he himself set the example of doing this, examined
plants with zeal and accuracy, and made above fifteen hundred drawings
of them.<a id="fnanchor36-16" href="#note36-16"><span
class="fnanchor">36</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note36-16"
href="#fnanchor36-16">36</a></span> His <i>Historia Stirpium</i> was
published at Basil in 1542.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page370">370</a></span> The
difficulty of representing plants in any useful way by means of
drawings, is greater, perhaps, than it at first appears. So long as no
distinction was made of the importance of different organs of the
plant, a picture representing merely the obvious general appearance
and larger parts, was of comparatively small value. Hence we are not
to wonder at the slighting manner in which Pliny speaks of such
records. “Those who gave such pictures of plants,” he says, “Crateuas,
Dionysius, Metrodorus, have shown nothing clearly, except the
difficulty of their undertaking. A picture may be mistaken, and is
changed and disfigured by copyists; and, without these imperfections,
it is not enough to represent the plant in one state, since it has
four different aspects in the four seasons of the year.”</p>
<p>The diffusion of the habit of exact drawing, especially among the
countrymen of Albert Durer and Lucas Cranach, and the invention of
wood-cuts and copper-plates, remedied some of these defects. Moreover,
the conviction gradually arose in men’s minds that the structure of
the flower and the fruit are the most important circumstances in
fixing the identity of the plant. Theophrastus speaks with precision
of the organs which he describes, but these are principally the
leaves, roots, and stems. Fuchs uses the term <i>apices</i> for the
anthers, and <i>gluma</i> for the blossom of grasses, thus showing
that he had noticed these parts as generally present.</p>
<p>In the next writer whom we have to mention, we find some traces of
a perception of the real resemblances of plants beginning to appear.
It is impossible to explain the progress of such views without
assuming in the reader some acquaintance with plants; but a very few
words may suffice to convey the requisite notions. Even in plants
which most commonly come in our way, we may perceive instances of the
resemblances of which we speak. Thus, Mint, Marjoram, Basil, Sage,
Lavender, Thyme, Dead-nettle, and many other plants, have a tubular
flower, of which the mouth is divided into two lips; hence they are
formed into a family, and termed <i>Labiatæ</i>. Again, the Stock, the
Wall-flower, the Mustard, the Cress, the Lady-smock, the Shepherd’s
purse, have, among other similarities, their blossoms with four petals
arranged crosswise; these are all of the order <i>Cruciferæ</i>. Other
flowers, apparently more complex, still resemble each other, as Daisy.
Marigold, Aster, and Chamomile; these belong to the order
<i>Compositæ</i>. And though the members of each such family may
differ widely in their larger parts, their stems and leaves, the close
study of nature leads the botanist irresistibly to consider their
resemblances as <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page371">371</a></span>
occupying a far more important place than their differences. It is the
general establishment of this conviction and its consequences which we
have now to follow.</p>
<p>The first writer in whom we find the traces of an arrangement
depending upon these natural resemblances, is Hieronymus Tragus,
(Jerom Bock,) a laborious German botanist, who, in 1551, published a
herbal. In this work, several of the species included in those natural
families to which we have alluded,<a id="fnanchor37-16"
href="#note37-16"><span class="fnanchor">37</span></a> as for instance
the Labiatæ, the Cruciferæ, the Compositæ, are for the most part
brought together; and thus, although with many mistakes as to such
connexions, a new principle of order is introduced into the
subject.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note37-16"
href="#fnanchor37-16">37</a></span> Sprengel, i. 270.</div>
<p>In pursuing the development of such principles of natural order, it
is necessary to recollect that the principles lead to an assemblage of
divisions and groups, successively subordinate, the lower to the
higher, like the brigades, regiments, and companies of an army, or the
provinces, towns, and parishes of a kingdom. Species are included in
Genera, Genera in Families or Orders, and orders in Classes. The
perception that there is some connexion among the species of plants,
was the first essential step; the detection of different marks and
characters which should give, on the one hand, limited groups, on the
other, comprehensive divisions, were other highly important parts of
this advance. To point out every successive movement in this progress
would be a task of extreme difficulty, but we may note, as the most
prominent portions of it, the establishment of the groups which
immediately include Species, that is, <i>the formation of Genera</i>;
and the invention of a method which should distribute into consistent
and distinct divisions the whole vegetable kingdom, that is, <i>the
construction of a System</i>.</p>
<p>To the second of these two steps we have no difficulty in assigning
its proper author. It belongs to Cæsalpinus, and marks the first great
epoch of this science. It is less easy to state to what botanist is
due the establishment of Genera; yet we may justly assign the greater
part of the merit of this invention, as is usually done, to Conrad
Gessner of Zurich. This eminent naturalist, after publishing his great
work on animals, died<a id="fnanchor38-16" href="#note38-16"><span
class="fnanchor">38</span></a> of the plague in 1565, at the age of
forty-nine, while he was preparing to publish a History of Plants, a
sequel to his History of Animals. The fate of the work thus left <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page372">372</a></span> unfinished was
remarkable. It fell into the hands of his pupil, Gaspard Wolf, who was
to have published it, but wanting leisure for the office, sold it to
Joachim Camerarius, a physician and botanist of Nuremberg, who made
use of the engravings prepared by Gessner, in an Epitome which he
published in 1586. The text of Gessner’s work, after passing through
various hands, was published in 1754 under the title of <i>Gessneri
Opera Botanica per duo Sæcula desiderata, &amp;c.</i>, but is very
incomplete.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note38-16"
href="#fnanchor38-16">38</a></span> Cuvier, <i>Leçons sur l’Hist. des
Sciences Naturelles</i>, partie ii. p. 193.</div>
<p>The imperfect state in which Gessner left his botanical labors,
makes it necessary to seek the evidence of his peculiar views in
scattered passages of his correspondence and other works. One of his
great merits was, that he saw the peculiar importance of the flower
and fruit as affording the characters by which the affinities of
plants were to be detected; and that he urged this view upon his
contemporaries. His plates present to us, by the side of each plant,
its flower and its fruit, carefully engraved. And in his
communications with his botanical correspondents, he repeatedly
insists on these parts. Thus<a id="fnanchor39-16"
href="#note39-16"><span class="fnanchor">39</span></a> in 1565 he
writes to Zuinger concerning some foreign plants which the latter
possessed: “Tell me if your plants have fruit and flower, as well as
stalk and leaves, for those are of much the greater consequence. By
these three marks,&#8212;flower, fruit, and seed,&#8212;I find that
Saxifraga and Consolida Regalis are related to Aconite.” These
characters, derived from the <i>fructification</i> (as the assemblage
of flower and fruit is called), are the means by which genera are
established, and hence, by the best botanists, Gessner is declared to
be the inventor of genera.<a id="fnanchor40-16"

I do not know if he here refers to any particular passages of
Gessner’s work.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page373">373</a></span> The labors
of Gessner in botany, both on account of the unfinished state in which
he left the application of his principles, and on account of the
absence of any principles manifestly applicable to the whole extent of
the vegetable kingdom, can only be considered as a prelude to the
epoch in which those defects were supplied. To that epoch we now
proceed.</p>
<h4 id="b16-3-2"><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Epoch of
Cæsalpinus.&#8212;Formation of a System of Arrangement.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">If</span> any one were disposed to
question whether Natural History truly belongs to the domain of
Inductive Science;&#8212;whether it is to be prosecuted by the same
methods, and requires the same endowments of mind as those which lead
to the successful cultivation of the Physical Sciences,&#8212;the
circumstances under which Botany has made its advance appear fitted to
remove such doubts. The first decided step in this study was merely
the construction of a classification of its subjects. We shall, I
trust, be able to show that such a classification includes, in
reality, the establishment of one general principle, and leads to
more. But without here dwelling on this point, it is worth notice that
the person to whom we owe this classification, Andreas Cæsalpinus of
Arezzo, was one of the most philosophical men of his time, profoundly
skilled in the Aristotelian lore which was then esteemed, yet gifted
with courage and sagacity which enabled him to weigh the value of the
Peripatetic doctrines, to reject what seemed error, and to look
onwards to a better philosophy. “How are we to understand,” he
inquires, “that we must proceed from universals to particulars (as
Aristotle directs), when particulars are better known?”<a
id="fnanchor41-16" href="#note41-16"><span
class="fnanchor">41</span></a> Yet he treats the Master with
deference, and, as has been observed,<a id="fnanchor42-16"
href="#note42-16"><span class="fnanchor">42</span></a> we see in his
great botanical work deep traces of the best features of the
Aristotelian school, logic and method; and, indeed, in this work he
frequently refers to his <i>Quæstiones Peripateticæ</i>. His book,
entitled <i>De Plantis libri</i> xvi. appeared at Florence in 1583.
The aspect under which his task presented itself to his mind appears
to me to possess so much interest, that I will transcribe a few of his
reflections. After speaking of the splendid multiplicity of the
productions of nature, and the confusion which has hitherto prevailed
among writers on plants, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page374">374</a></span> the growing treasures of the botanical
world; he adds,<a id="fnanchor43-16" href="#note43-16"><span
class="fnanchor">43</span></a> “In this immense multitude of plants, I
see that want which is most felt in any other unordered crowd: if such
an assemblage be not arranged into brigades like an army, all must be
tumult and fluctuation. And this accordingly happens in the treatment
of plants: for the mind is overwhelmed by the confused accumulation of
things, and thus arise endless mistake and angry altercation.” He then
states his general view, which, as we shall see, was adopted by his
successors. “<em>Since all science consists in the collection of
similar, and the distinction of dissimilar things</em>, and since the
consequence of this is a distribution into genera and species, which
are to be natural classes governed by real differences, I have
attempted to execute this task in the whole range of plants;&#8212;ut
si quid pro ingenii mei tenuitate in hujusmodi studio profecerim, ad
communem utilitatem proferam.” We see here how clearly he claims for
himself the credit of being the first to execute this task of
arrangement.</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note43-16"

<p>After certain preparatory speculations, he says,<a
id="fnanchor44-16" href="#note44-16"><span
class="fnanchor">44</span></a> “Let us now endeavor to mark the kinds
of plants by essential circumstances in the fructification.” He then
observes, “In the constitution of organs three things are mainly
important&#8212;the number, the position, the figure.” And he then
proceeds to exemplify this: “Some have under one flower, <span
class="sc">one</span> <i>seed</i>, as <i>Amygdala</i>, or <span
class="sc">one</span> seed-<i>receptacle</i>, as <i>Rosa</i>; or <span
class="sc">two </span><i>seeds</i>, as <i>Ferularia</i>, or <span
class="sc">two</span> seed-<i>receptacles</i>, as <i>Nasturtium</i>;
or three, as the <i>Tithymalum</i> kind have <span
class="sc">three</span> <i>seeds</i>, the <i>Bulbaceæ</i> <span
class="sc">three</span> <i>receptacles</i>; or four, as
<i>Marrubium</i>, <span class="sc">four</span> <i>seeds</i>,
<i>Siler</i> <span class="sc">four</span> <i>receptacles</i>; or more,
as <i>Cicoraceæ</i>, and <i>Acanaceæ</i> have <span
class="sc">more</span> <i>seeds</i>, <i>Pinus</i>, <span
class="sc">more</span> <i>receptacles</i>.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note44-16"
href="#fnanchor44-16">44</a></span> Lib. i. c. 13, 14.</div>
<p>It will be observed that we have here ten classes made out by means
of number alone, added to the consideration of whether the seed is
alone in its covering, as in a cherry, or contained in a receptacle
with several others, as in a berry, pod, or capsule. Several of these
divisions are, however, further subdivided according to other
circumstances, and especially according as the vital part of the seed,
which he called the heart (<i>cor</i><a id="fnanchor45-16"
href="#note45-16"><span class="fnanchor">45</span></a>), is situated
in the upper or lower part of the seed. As our object here is only to
indicate the principle of the method of Cæsalpinus, I need not further
dwell on the details, and still less on the defects by which it is
disfigured, as, for instance, the retention of the old distinction of
Trees, Shrubs, and Herbs.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note45-16"
href="#fnanchor45-16">45</a></span> <i>Corculum</i>, of Linnæus.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page375">375</a></span> To some
persons it may appear that this arbitrary distribution of the
vegetable kingdom, according to the number of parts of a particular
kind, cannot deserve to be spoken of as a great discovery. And if,
indeed, the distribution had been arbitrary, this would have been
true; the real merit of this and of every other system is, that while
it is artificial in its form, it is natural in its results. The plants
which are associated by the arrangement of Cæsalpinus, are those which
have the closest resemblances in the most essential points. Thus, as
Linnæus says, though the first in attempting to form natural orders,
he observed as many as the most successful of later writers. Thus his
<i>Legumina</i><a id="fnanchor46-16" href="#note46-16"><span
class="fnanchor">46</span></a> correspond to the natural order
<i>Leguminosæ</i>; his <i>genus Ferulaceum</i><a id="fnanchor47-16"
href="#note47-16"><span class="fnanchor">47</span></a> to the
<i>Umbellatæ</i>; his <i>Bulbaceæ</i><a id="fnanchor48-16"
href="#note48-16"><span class="fnanchor">48</span></a> to
<i>Liliaceæ</i>; his <i>Anthemides</i><a id="fnanchor49-16"
href="#note49-16"><span class="fnanchor">49</span></a> to the
<i>Compositæ</i>; in like manner, the <i>Boragineæ</i> are brought
together,<a id="fnanchor50-16" href="#note50-16"><span
class="fnanchor">50</span></a> and the <i>Labiatæ</i>. That such
assemblages are produced by the application of his principles, is a
sufficient evidence that they have their foundation in the general
laws of the vegetable world. If this had not been the case, the mere
application of number or figure alone as a standard of arrangement,
would have produced only intolerable anomalies. If, for instance,
Cæsalpinus had arranged plants by the number of flowers on the same
stalk, he would have separated individuals of the same species; if he
had distributed them according to the number of leaflets which compose
the leaves, he would have had to place far asunder different species
of the same genus. Or, as he himself says,<a id="fnanchor51-16"
href="#note51-16"><span class="fnanchor">51</span></a> “If we make one
genus of those which have a round root, as Rapum, Aristolochia,
Cyclaminus, Aton, we shall separate from this genus those which most
agree with it, as Napum and Raphanum, which resemble Rapum, and the
long Aristolochia, which resembles the round; while we shall join the
most remote kinds, for the nature of Cyclaminus and Rapum is
altogether diverse in all other respects. Or if we attend to the
differences of stalk, so as to make one genus of those which have a
naked stalk, as the Junci, Cæpe, Aphacæ, along with Cicoraceæ, Violæ,
we shall still connect the most unlike things, and disjoin the closest
affinities. And if we note the differences of leaves, or even flowers,
we fall into the same difficulty; for many plants very different in
kind have leaves very similar, as Polygonum and Hypericum, Ernea and
Sesamois, Apium and Ranunculus; and plants of the same genus have
sometimes very different <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page376">376</a></span> leaves, as the several species of
Ranunculus and of Lactuca. Nor will color or shape of the flowers help
us better; for what has Vitis in common with Œnanthe, except the
resemblance of the flower?” He then goes on to say, that if we seek a
too close coincidence of all the characters we shall have no Species;
and thus shows us that he had clearly before his view the difficulty,
which he had to attack, and which it is his glory to have overcome,
that of constructing Natural Orders.</p>

<p>But as the principles of Cæsalpinus are justified, on the one hand,
by their leading to <i>Natural Orders</i>, they are recommended on the
other by their producing a <i>System</i> which applies through the
whole extent of the vegetable kingdom. The parts from which he takes
his characters must occur in all flowering-plants, for all such plants
have seeds. And these seeds, if not very numerous for each flower,
will be of a certain definite number and orderly distribution. And
thus every plant will fall into one part or other of the same
system.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to point out, in this induction of Cæsalpinus,
the two elements which we have so often declared must occur in all
inductive processes; the exact acquaintance with <em>facts</em>, and
the general and applicable <em>ideas</em> by which these facts are
brought together. Cæsalpinus was no mere dealer in intellectual
relations or learned traditions, but a laborious and persevering
collector of plants and of botanical knowledge. “For many years,” he
says in his Dedication, “I have been pursuing my researches in various
regions, habitually visiting the places in which grew the various
kinds of herbs, shrubs, and trees; I have been assisted by the labors
of many friends, and by gardens established for the public benefit,
and containing foreign plants collected from the most remote regions.”
He here refers to the first garden directed to the public study of
Botany, which was that of Pisa,<a id="fnanchor52-16"
href="#note52-16"><span class="fnanchor">52</span></a> instituted in
1543, by order of the Grand Duke Cosmo the First. The management of it
was confided first to Lucas Ghini, and afterwards to Cæsalpinus. He
had collected also a herbarium of dried plants, which he calls the
rudiment of his work. “Tibi enim,” he says, in his dedication to
Francis Medici, Grand Duke of Etruria, “apud quem extat ejus
rudimentum ex plantis libro agglutinatis a me compositum.” And,
throughout, he speaks with the most familiar and vivid acquaintance of
the various vegetables which he describes.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note52-16"
href="#fnanchor52-16">52</a></span> Cuv. 187.</div>
<p>But Cæsalpinus also possessed fixed and general views concerning
the relation and functions of the parts of plants, and ideas of
symmetry <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page377">377</a></span> and
system; without which, as we see in other botanists of his and
succeeding times, the mere accumulation of a knowledge of details does
not lead to any advance in science. We have already mentioned his
reference to general philosophical principles, both of the
Peripatetics and of his own. The first twelve chapters of his work are
employed in explaining the general structure of plants, and especially
that point to which he justly attaches so much importance, the results
of the different situation of the <i>cor</i> or <i>corculum</i> of the
seed. He shows<a id="fnanchor53-16" href="#note53-16"><span
class="fnanchor">53</span></a> that if we take the root, or stem, or
leaves, or blossom, as our guide in classification, we shall separate
plants obviously alike, and approximate those which have merely
superficial resemblances. And thus we see that he had in his mind
ideas of fixed resemblance and symmetrical distribution, which he
sedulously endeavored to apply to plants; while his acquaintance with
the vegetable kingdom enabled him to see in what manner these ideas
were not, and in what manner they were, really applicable.</p>

<p>The great merit and originality of Cæsalpinus have been generally
allowed, by the best of the more modern writers on Botany. Linnæus
calls him one of the founders of the science; “Primus verus
systematicus;”<a id="fnanchor54-16" href="#note54-16"><span
class="fnanchor">54</span></a> and, as if not satisfied with the
expression of his admiration in prose, hangs a poetical garland on the
tomb of his hero. The following distich concludes his remarks on this
writer:</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quisquis hic extiterit primos concedet
honores</span><br />
<span class="i0">Cæsalpine tibi; primaque serta dabit:</span><br />
</div></div>
<p class="noind">and similar language of praise has been applied to
him by the best botanists up to Cuvier,<a id="fnanchor55-16"
href="#note55-16"><span class="fnanchor">55</span></a> who justly
terms his book “a work of genius.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note54-16"

<p>Perhaps the great advance made in this science by Cæsalpinus, is
most strongly shown by this; that no one appeared, to follow the path
which he had opened to system and symmetry, for nearly a century.
Moreover, when the progress of this branch of knowledge was resumed,
his next successor, Morison, did not choose to acknowledge that he had
borrowed so much from so old a writer; and thus, hardly mentions his
name, although he takes advantage of his labors, and even transcribes
his words without acknowledgement, as I shall show. The pause between
the great invention of Cæsalpinus, and its natural sequel, the
developement and improvement of his method, is so marked, that I <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page378">378</a></span> will, in order to
avoid too great an interruption of chronological order, record some of
its circumstances in a separate section.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Stationary Interval.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> method of Cæsalpinus was
not, at first, generally adopted. It had, indeed, some disadvantages.
Employed in drawing the boundary-lines of the larger divisions of the
vegetable kingdom, he had omitted those smaller groups, Genera, which
were both most obvious to common botanists, and most convenient in the
description and comparison of plants. He had also neglected to give
the Synonyms of other authors for the plants spoken of by him; an
appendage to botanical descriptions, which the increase of botanical
information and botanical books had now rendered indispensable. And
thus it happened, that a work, which must always be considered as
forming a great epoch in the science to which it refers, was probably
little read, and in a short time could be treated as if it were quite
forgotten.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the science was gradually improved in its
details. Clusius, or Charles de l’Ecluse, first taught botanists to
describe well. “Before him,” says Mirbel,<a id="fnanchor56-16"
href="#note56-16"><span class="fnanchor">56</span></a> “the
descriptions were diffuse, obscure, indistinct; or else concise,
incomplete, vague. Clusius introduced exactitude, precision, neatness,
elegance, method: he says nothing superfluous; he omits nothing
necessary.” He travelled over great part of Europe, and published
various works on the more rare of the plants which he had seen. Among
such plants, we may note now one well known, the potato; which he
describes as being commonly used in Italy in 1586;<a
id="fnanchor57-16" href="#note57-16"><span
class="fnanchor">57</span></a> thus throwing doubt, at least, on the
opinion which ascribes the first introduction of it into Europe to Sir
Walter Raleigh, on his return from Virginia, about the same period. As
serving to illustrate, both this point, and the descriptive style of
Clusius, I quote, in a note, his description of the flower of this
plant.<a id="fnanchor58-16" href="#note58-16"><span
class="fnanchor">58</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note56-16"

Theoph. forte. Flores elegantes, uncialis amplitudinis aut majores,

folia discreta videantur, coloris exterius ex purpura candicantis,

&#8195;He says that the Italians do not know whence they had the plant,
and that they call it <i>Taratouffli</i>. The name <i>Potato</i> was,
in England, previously applied to the Sweet Potato (<i>Convolvulus
batatas</i>), which was the <em>common</em> Potato, in distinction to
the <em>Virginian </em>Potato, at the time of Gerard’s Herbal. (1597?)
Gerard’s figures of both plants are copied from those of Clusius.<br />
&#8195;It may be seen by the description of Arachidna, already quoted
from Theophrastus, (<a href="#fnanchor12-16">above</a>,) that there is
little plausibility in Clusius’s conjecture of the plant being known
to the ancients. I need not inform the botanist that this opinion is
untenable.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page379">379</a></span> The addition
of exotic species to the number of known plants was indeed going on
rapidly during the interval which we are now considering. Francis
Hernandez, a Spaniard, who visited America towards the end of the
sixteenth century, collected and described many plants of that
country, some of which were afterwards published by Recchi.<a
id="fnanchor59-16" href="#note59-16"><span
class="fnanchor">59</span></a> Barnabas Cobo, who went as a missionary
to America in 1596, also described plants.<a id="fnanchor60-16"
href="#note60-16"><span class="fnanchor">60</span></a> The Dutch,
among other exertions which they made in their struggle with the
tyranny of Spain, sent out an expedition which, for a time, conquered
the Brazils; and among other fruits of this conquest, they published
an account of the natural history of the country.<a id="fnanchor61-16"
href="#note61-16"><span class="fnanchor">61</span></a> To avoid
interrupting the connexion of such labors, I will here carry them on a
little further in the order of time. Paul Herman, of Halle, in Saxony,
went to the Cape of Good Hope and to Ceylon; and on his return,
astonished the botanists of Europe by the vast quantity of remarkable
plants which he introduced to their knowledge.<a id="fnanchor62-16"
href="#note62-16"><span class="fnanchor">62</span></a> Rheede, the
Dutch governor of Malabar, ordered descriptions and drawings to be
made of many curious species, which were published in a large work in
twelve folio volumes.<a id="fnanchor63-16" href="#note63-16"><span
class="fnanchor">63</span></a> Rumphe, another Dutch consul at
Amboyna,<a id="fnanchor64-16" href="#note64-16"><span
class="fnanchor">64</span></a> labored with zeal and success upon the
plants of the Moluccas. Some species which occur in Madagascar figured
in a description of that island composed by the French Commandant
Flacourt.<a id="fnanchor65-16" href="#note65-16"><span

Kæmpfer,<a id="fnanchor66-16" href="#note66-16"><span

undaunted courage, visited Persia, Arabia Felix, the Mogul Empire,
Ceylon, Bengal, Sumatra, Java, Siam, Japan; Wheler travelled in Greece
and Asia Minor; and Sherard, the English consul, published an account
of the plants of the neighborhood of Smyrna.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page380">380</a></span> At the same
time, the New World excited also the curiosity of botanists. Hans
Sloane collected the plants of Jamaica; John Banister those of
Virginia; William Vernon, also an Englishman, and David Kriege, a
Saxon, those of Maryland; two Frenchmen, Surian and Father Plumier,
those of Saint Domingo.</p>
<p>We may add that public botanical gardens were about this time
established all over Europe. We have already noticed the institution
of that of Pisa in 1543; the second was that of Padua in 1545; the
next, that of Florence in 1556; the fourth, that of Bologna, 1568;
that of Rome, in the Vatican, dates also from 1568.</p>
<p>The first transalpine garden of this kind arose at Leyden in 1577;
that of Leipzig in 1580. Henry the Fourth of France established one at
Montpellier in 1597. Several others were instituted in Germany; but
that of Paris did not begin to exist till 1626; that of Upsal,
afterwards so celebrated, took its rise in 1657, that of Amsterdam in
1684. Morison, whom we shall soon have to mention, calls himself, in
1680, the first Director of the Botanical Garden at Oxford.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [To what is above said of Botanical Gardens and Botanical
Writers, between the times of Cæsalpinus and Morison, I may add a few
circumstances. The first academical garden in France was that at
Montpellier, which was established by Peter Richier de Belleval, at
the end of the sixteenth century. About the same period, rare flowers
were cultivated at Paris, and pictures of them made, in order to
supply the embroiderers of the court-robes with new patterns. Thus
figures of the most beautiful flowers in the garden of Peter Robins
were published by the court-embroiderer Peter Vallet, in 1608, under
the title of <i>Le Jardin du Roi Henry IV</i>. But Robins’ works were
of great service to botany; and his garden assisted the studies of
Renealmus (Paul Reneaulme), whose <i>Specimen Historiæ Plantarum</i>
(Paris, 1611), is highly spoken of by the best botanists. Recently,
Mr. Robert Brown has named after him a new genus of <i>Irideæ</i>
(<span class="sc">Renealmia</span>); adding, “Dixi in memoriam <span
class="sc">Pauli Renealmi</span>, botanici sui ævi accuratissimi,
atque staminum primi scrutatoris; qui non modo eorum numerum et situm,
sed etiam filamentorum proportionem passim descripsit, et characterem
tetradynamicum siliquosarum perspexit.” (<i>Prodromus Floræ Novæ
Hollandiæ</i>, p. 448.)</p>
<p>The oldest Botanical Garden in England is that at Hampton Court,
founded by Queen Elizabeth, and much enriched by Charles II. and
William III. (Sprengel, <i>Gesch. d. Bot.</i> vol. ii. p. 96.)]</p>
<p>In the mean time, although there appeared no new system which <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page381">381</a></span> commanded the
attention of the botanical world, the feeling of the importance of the
affinities of plants became continually more strong and distinct.</p>
<p>Lobel, who was botanist to James the First, and who published his
<i>Stirpium Adversaria Nova</i> in 1571, brings together the natural
families of plants more distinctly than his predecessors, and even
distinguishes (as Cuvier states,<a id="fnanchor67-16"
href="#note67-16"><span class="fnanchor">67</span></a>)
monocotyledonous from dicotyledonous plants; one of the most
comprehensive division-lines of botany, of which succeeding times
discovered the value more completely. Fabius Columna,<a
id="fnanchor68-16" href="#note68-16"><span
class="fnanchor">68</span></a> in 1616, gave figures of the
fructification of plants on copper, as Gessner had before done on
wood. But the elder Bauhin (John), notwithstanding all that Cæsalpinus
had done, retrograded, in a work published in 1619, into the less
precise and scientific distinctions of&#8212;trees with nuts; with
berries; with acorns; with pods; creeping plants, gourds, &amp;c.: and
no clear progress towards a system was anywhere visible among the
authors of this period.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note67-16"
href="#fnanchor67-16">67</a></span> Cuv. <i>Leçons, &amp;c.</i>
198.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note68-16"
href="#fnanchor68-16">68</a></span> Ib. 206.</div>
<p>While this continued to be the case, and while the materials, thus
destitute of order, went on accumulating, it was inevitable that the
evils which Cæsalpinus had endeavored to remedy, should become more
and more grievous. “The nomenclature of the subject<a
id="fnanchor69-16" href="#note69-16"><span
class="fnanchor">69</span></a> was in such disorder, it was so
impossible to determine with certainty the plants spoken of by
preceding writers, that thirty or forty different botanists had given
to the same plant almost as many different names. Bauhin called by one
appellation, a species which Lobel or Matheoli designated by another.
There was an actual chaos, a universal confusion, in which it was
impossible for men to find their way.” We can the better understand
such a state of things, from having, in our own time, seen another
classificatory science, Mineralogy, in the very condition thus
described. For such a state of confusion there is no remedy but the
establishment of a true system of classification; which by its real
foundation renders a reason for the place of each species; and which,
by the fixity of its classes, affords a basis for a standard
nomenclature, as finally took place in Botany. But before such a
remedy is obtained, men naturally try to alleviate the evil by
tabulating the synonyms of different writers, as far as they are able
to do so. The task of constructing such a <i>Synonymy</i> of botany at
the period of which we speak, was undertaken by Gaspard Bauhin, the
brother of John, but nineteen years younger. This work, the <i>Pinax
Theatri Botanici</i>, was printed <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page382">382</a></span> at Basil in 1623. It was a useful
undertaking at the time; but the want of any genuine order in the
<i>Pinax</i> itself, rendered it impossible that it should be of great
permanent utility.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note69-16"
href="#fnanchor69-16">69</a></span> Ib. 212.</div>
<p>After this period, the progress of almost all the sciences became
languid for a while; and one reason of this interruption was, the wars
and troubles which prevailed over almost the whole of Europe. The
quarrels of Charles the First and his parliament, the civil wars and
the usurpation, in England; in France, the war of the League, the
stormy reign of Henry the Fourth, the civil wars of the minority of
Louis the Thirteenth, the war against the Protestants and the war of
the Fronde in the minority of Louis the Fourteenth; the bloody and
destructive Thirty Years’ War in Germany; the war of Spain with the
United Provinces and with Portugal;&#8212;all these dire agitations
left men neither leisure nor disposition to direct their best thoughts
to the promotion of science. The baser spirits were brutalized; the
better were occupied by high practical aims and struggles of their
moral nature. Amid such storms, the intellectual powers of man could
not work with their due calmness, nor his intellectual objects shine
with their proper lustre.</p>
<p>At length a period of greater tranquillity gleamed forth, and the
sciences soon expanded in the sunshine. Botany was not inert amid this
activity, and rapidly advanced in a new direction, that of physiology;
but before we speak of this portion of our subject, we must complete
what we have to say of it as a classificatory science.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 4.&#8212;<i>Sequel to the Epoch of Cæsalpinus.
Further Formation and Adoption of Systematic Arrangement.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Soon</span> after the period of
which we now speak, that of the restoration of the Stuarts to the
throne of England, systematic arrangements of plants appeared in great
numbers; and in a manner such as to show that the minds of botanists
had gradually been ripening for this improvement, through the
influence of preceding writers, and the growing acquaintance with
plants. The person whose name is usually placed first on this list,
Robert Morison, appears to me to be much less meritorious than many of
those who published very shortly after him; but I will give him the
precedence in my narrative. He was a Scotchman, who was wounded
fighting on the royalist side in the civil wars of England. On the
triumph of the republicans, he withdrew to France, when he became
director of the garden of Gaston, Duke of Orléans at Blois; and there
he came under the notice of our Charles <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page383">383</a></span> the Second; who, on his restoration,
summoned Morison to England, where he became Superintendent of the
Royal Gardens, and also of the Botanic Garden at Oxford. In 1669, he
published <i>Remarks on the Mistakes of the two Bauhins</i>, in which
he proves that many plants in the <i>Pinax</i> are erroneously placed,
and shows considerable talent for appreciating natural families and
genera. His great systematic work appeared from the University press
at Oxford in 1680. It contains a system, but a system, Cuvier says,<a
id="fnanchor70-16" href="#note70-16"><span
class="fnanchor">70</span></a> which approaches rather to a natural
method than to a rigorous distribution, like that of his predecessor
Cæsalpinus, or that of his successor Ray. Thus the herbaceous plants
are divided into <i>climbers</i>, <i>leguminous</i>, <i>siliquose</i>,
<i>unicapsalar</i>, <i>bicapsular</i>, <i>tricapsular</i>,
<i>quadricapsular</i>, <i>quinquecapsular</i>; this division being
combined with characters derived from the number of petals. But along
with these numerical elements, are introduced others of a loose and
heterogeneous kind, for instance, the classification of herbs as
<i>lactescent</i> and <i>emollient</i>. It is not unreasonable to say,
that such a scheme shows no talent for constructing a complete system;
and that the most distinct part of it, that dependent on the fruit,
was probably borrowed from Cæsalpinus. That this is so, we have, I
think, strong proof; for though Morison nowhere, I believe, mentions
Cæsalpinus, except in one place in a loose enumeration of botanical
writers,<a id="fnanchor71-16" href="#note71-16"><span
class="fnanchor">71</span></a> he must have made considerable use of
his work. For he has introduced into his own preface a passage copied
literally<a id="fnanchor72-16" href="#note72-16"><span
class="fnanchor">72</span></a> from the dedication of Cæsalpinus;
which passage we have already quoted (<a href="#v2page374">p.
374</a>,) beginning, “Since all science consists in the collection of
similar, and the distinction of dissimilar things.” And that the
mention of the original is not omitted by accident, appears from this;
that Morison appropriates also the conclusion of the passage, which
has a personal reference, “<i>Conatus sum id præstare in universa
plantarum historia, ut si quid pro ingenii mei tenuitate in hujusmodi
studio profecerim, ad communem utilitatem proferrem.</i>” That
Morison, thus, at so long an interval after the publication of the
work of Cæsalpinus, borrowed from him without acknowledgement, and
adopted his system so as to mutilate it, proves that he had neither
the temper nor the talent of a discoverer; and justifies us
withholding from him the credit which belongs to those, who, in his
time, resumed the great undertaking of constructing a vegetable
system.</p>

<p>Among those whose efforts in this way had the greatest and earliest
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page384">384</a></span> influence, was
undoubtedly our countryman, John Ray, who was Fellow of Trinity
College, Cambridge, at the same time with Isaac Newton. But though
Cuvier states<a id="fnanchor73-16" href="#note73-16"><span
class="fnanchor">73</span></a> that Ray was the model of the
systematists during the whole of the eighteenth century, the Germans
claim a part of his merit for one of their countrymen, Joachim Jung,
of Lubeck, professor at Hamburg.<a id="fnanchor74-16"
href="#note74-16"><span class="fnanchor">74</span></a> Concerning the
principles of this botanist, little was known during his life. But a
manuscript of his book was communicated<a id="fnanchor75-16"
href="#note75-16"><span class="fnanchor">75</span></a> to Ray in 1660,
and from this time forwards, says Sprengel, there might be noticed in
the writings of Englishmen, those better and clearer views to which
Jung’s principles gave birth. Five years after the death of Jung, his
<i>Doxoscopia Physica</i> was published, in 1662; and in 1678, his
<i>Isagoge Phytoscopica</i>. But neither of these works was ever much
read; and even Linnæus, whom few things escaped which concerned
botany, had, in 1771, seen none of Jung’s works.</p>

definition of <i>caulis</i>.</div>
<p>I here pass over Jung’s improvements of botanical language, and
speak only of those which he is asserted to have suggested in the
arrangement of plants. He examines, says Sprengel,<a
id="fnanchor76-16" href="#note76-16"><span
class="fnanchor">76</span></a> the value of characters of species,
which, he holds, must not be taken from the thorns, nor from color,
taste, smell, medicinal effects, time and place of blossoming. He
shows, in numerous examples, what plants must be separated, though
called by a common name, and what most be united, though their names
are several.</p>

<p>I do not see in this much that interferes with the originality of
Ray’s method,<a id="fnanchor77-16" href="#note77-16"><span
class="fnanchor">77</span></a> of which, in consequence of the
importance ascribed to it by Cuvier, as we have already seen, I shall
give an account, following that great naturalist.<a id="fnanchor78-16"
href="#note78-16"><span class="fnanchor">78</span></a> I confine
myself to the ordinary plants, and omit the more obscure vegetables,
as mushrooms, mosses, ferns, and the like.</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note79-16"
href="#fnanchor79-16">79</a></span> <i>Involucrum</i>, in modern
terminology.</div>
<p>In the <i>simple</i> flowers, the seeds are <i>naked</i>, or in a
<i>pericarp</i>. Those with <i>naked</i> seeds are arranged according
to the number of the seeds, which may be one, two, three, four, or
more. If there is only one, no subdivision is requisite: if there are
two, Ray makes a subdivision, according as the flower has five petals,
or a continuous corolla. Here we come to several natural families.
Thus, the flowers with two seeds and five petals are the
<i>Umbelliferous</i> plants; the monopetalous flowers with two seeds
are the <i>Stellatæ</i>. He founds the division of four-seeded flowers
on the circumstance of the leaves being opposite, or alternate; and
thus again, we have the natural families of <i>Asperifoliæ</i>, as
<i>Echium</i>, &amp;c., which have the leaves alternate, and the
<i>Verticillatæ</i>, as <i>Salvia</i>, in which the leaves are
opposite. When the flower has more than four seeds, he makes no
subdivision.</p>
<p>So much for simple flowers with naked seeds. In those where the
seeds are surrounded by a <i>pericarp</i>, or fruit, this fruit is
large, soft, and fleshy, and the plants are <i>pomiferous</i>; or it
is small and juicy, and the fruit is a berry, as a Gooseberry.</p>
<p>If the fruit is not juicy, but <i>dry</i>, it is multiple or
simple. If it be simple, we have the <i>leguminose</i> plants. If it
be multiple, the form of the flower is to be attended to. The flower
may be <i>monopetalous</i>, or <i>tetrapetalous</i>, or
<i>pentapetalous</i>, or with still <i>more</i> divisions. The
monopetalous may be <i>regular</i> or <i>irregular</i>; so may the
tetrapetalous. The regular tetrapetalous flowers are, for example, the
<i>Cruciferæ</i>, as Stock and Cauliflower; the irregular, are the
<i>papilionaceous</i> plants, Peas, Beans, and Vetches; and thus we
again come to natural families. The remaining plants are divided in
the same way, into those with <i>imperfect</i>, and those with
<i>perfect</i>, flowers. Those with <i>imperfect</i> flowers are the
<i>Grasses</i>, the <i>Rushes</i> (<i>Junci</i>), and the like; among
those with <i>perfect</i> flowers, are the <i>Palmaceæ</i>, and the
<i>Liliaceæ</i>.</p>
<p>We see that the division of plants is complete as a system; all
flowers must belong to one or other of the divisions. Fully to explain
the characters and further subdivisions of these families, would be to
write a treatise on botany; but it is easily seen that they exhaust
the subject as far as they go.</p>
<p>Thus Ray constructed his system partly on the fruit and partly on
the flower; or more properly, according to the expression of Linnæus,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page386">386</a></span> comparing his
earlier with his later system, he began by being a <i>fructicist</i>,
and ended by being a <i>corollist</i>.<a id="fnanchor80-16"

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note80-16"

herbalizer, and I cannot understand on what ground Mirbel asserts
(<i>Physiol. Veg.</i>, tom. ii. p. 531,) that he was better acquainted
with books than with plants.</div>
<p>As we have said, a number of systems of arrangement of plants were
published about this time, some founded on the fruit, some on the
corolla, some on the calyx, and these employed in various ways.
Rivinus<a id="fnanchor81-16" href="#note81-16"><span
class="fnanchor">81</span></a> (whose real name was Bachman,)
classified by the flower alone; instead of combining it with the
fruit, as Ray had done.<a id="fnanchor82-16" href="#note82-16"><span
class="fnanchor">82</span></a> He had the further merit of being the
first who rejected the old division, of <i>woody</i> and
<i>herbaceous</i> plants; a division which, though at variance with
any system founded upon the structure of the plants was employed even
by Tournefort, and only finally expelled by Linnæus.</p>

<p>It would throw little light upon the history of botany, especially
for our purpose, to dwell on the peculiarities of these transitory
systems. Linnæus,<a id="fnanchor83-16" href="#note83-16"><span
class="fnanchor">83</span></a> after his manner, has given a
classification of them. Rivinus, as we have just seen, was a
<i>corollist</i>, according to the regularity and number of the
petals; Hermann was a <i>fructicist</i>. Christopher Knaut<a
id="fnanchor84-16" href="#note84-16"><span
class="fnanchor">84</span></a> adopted the system of Ray, but inverted
the order of its parts; Christian Knaut did nearly the same with
regard to that of Rivinus, taking number before regularity in the
flower.<a id="fnanchor85-16" href="#note85-16"><span

<p>Of the systems which prevailed previous to that of Linnæus,
Tournefort’s was by far the most generally accepted. Joseph Pitton de
Tournefort was of a noble family in Provence, and was appointed
professor at the Jardin du Roi in 1683. His well-known travels in the
Levant are interesting on other subjects, as well as botany. His
<i>Institutio Rei Herbariæ</i>, published in 1700, contains his
method, which is that of a <i>corollist</i>. He is guided by the
regularity or irregularity of the flowers, by their form, and by the
situation of the receptacle of the seeds below the calyx, or within
it. Thus his classes are&#8212;those in which the flowers are
<i>campaniform</i>, or bell-shaped; those in which they are
<i>infundibuliform</i>, or funnel-shaped, as Tobacco; then the
irregular flowers, as the <i>Personatæ</i>, which resemble an ancient
mask; the <i>Labiatæ</i>, with their two lips; the <i>Cruciform</i>;
the <i>Rosaceæ</i>, with flowers like a rose; the <i>Umbelliferæ</i>;
the <i>Caryophylleæ</i>, as the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page387">387</a></span> Pink; the <i>Liliaceæ</i>, with six
petals, as the Tulip, Narcissus, Hyacinth, Lily; the
<i>Papilionaceæ</i>, which are leguminous plants, the flower of which
resembles a butterfly, as Peas and Beans; and finally, the
<i>Anomalous</i>, as Violet, Nasturtium, and others.</p>
<p>Though this system was found to be attractive, as depending, in an
evident way, on the most conspicuous part of the plant, the flower, it
is easy to see that it was much less definite than systems like that
of Rivinus, Hermann, and Ray, which were governed by number. But
Tournefort succeeded in giving to the characters of genera a degree of
rigor never before attained, and abstracted them in a separate form.
We have already seen that the reception of botanical Systems has
depended much on their arrangement into Genera.</p>
<p>Tournefort’s success was also much promoted by the author inserting
in his work a figure of a flower and fruit belonging to each genus;
and the figures, drawn by Aubriet, were of great merit. The study of
botany was thus rendered easy, for it could be learned by turning over
the leaves of a book. In spite of various defects, these advantages
gave this writer an ascendancy which lasted, from 1700, when his book
appeared, for more than half a century. For though Linnæus began to
publish in 1735, his method and his nomenclature were not generally
adopted till 1760.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">The Reform of Linnæus.</span></h3>
<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Introduction of the
Reform.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">ALTHOUGH</span>, perhaps, no man of
science ever exercised a greater sway than Linnæus, or had more
enthusiastic admirers, the most intelligent botanists always speak of
him, not as a great discoverer, but as a judicious and strenuous
<i>Reformer</i>. Indeed, in his own lists of botanical writers, he
places himself among the “Reformatores;” and it is apparent that this
is the nature of his real claim to admiration; for the doctrine of the
sexes of plants, even if he had been the first to establish it, was a
point of botanical physiology, a province of the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page388">388</a></span> science which no one
would select as the peculiar field of Linnæus’s glory; and the
formation of a system of arrangement on the basis of this doctrine,
though attended with many advantages, was not an improvement of any
higher order than those introduced by Ray and Tournefort. But as a
Reformer of the state of Natural History in his time, Linnæus was
admirable for his skill, and unparalleled in his success. And we have
already seen, in the instance of the reform of mineralogy, as
attempted by Mohs and Berzelius, that men of great talents and
knowledge may fail in such an undertaking.</p>
<p>It is, however, only by means of the knowledge which he displays,
and of the beauty and convenience of the improvements which he
proposes, that any one can acquire such an influence as to procure his
suggestions to be adopted. And even if original circumstances of birth
or position could invest any one with peculiar prerogatives and powers
in the republic of science, Karl Linné began his career with no such
advantages. His father was a poor curate in Smaland, a province of
Sweden; his boyhood was spent in poverty and privation; it was with
great difficulty that, at the age of twenty-one, he contrived to
subsist at the University of Upsal, whither a strong passion for
natural history had urged him. Here, however, he was so far fortunate,
that Olaus Rudbeck, the professor of botany, committed to him the care
of the Botanic Garden.<a id="fnanchor86-16" href="#note86-16"><span
class="fnanchor">86</span></a> The perusal of the works of Vaillant
and Patrick Blair suggested to him the idea of an arrangement of
plants, formed upon the sexual organs, the stamens and pistils; and of
such an arrangement he published a sketch in 1731, at the age of
twenty-four.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note86-16"
href="#fnanchor86-16">86</a></span> Sprengel, ii. 232.</div>
<p>But we must go forwards a few years in his life, to come to the
period to which his most important works belong. University and family
quarrels induced him to travel; and, after various changes of scene,
he was settled in Holland, as the curator of the splendid botanical
garden of George Clifford, an opulent banker. Here it was<a
id="fnanchor87-16" href="#note87-16"><span
class="fnanchor">87</span></a> that he laid the foundation of his
future greatness. In the two years of his residence at <span
class="correction" title="corrected from Harlecamp in the 3rd edition
additions">Hartecamp</span>, he published nine works. The first, the
<i>Systema Naturæ</i>, which contained a comprehensive sketch of the
whole domain of Natural History, excited general astonishment, by the
acuteness of the observations, the happy talent of combination, and
the clearness of the systematic views. Such a work could not fail to
procure considerable respect for its author. His <i>Hortus
Cliffortiana</i> <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page389">389</a></span> and <i>Musa Cliffortiana</i> added to
this impression. The weight which he had thus acquired, he proceeded
to use for the improvement of botany. His <i>Fundamenta Botanica</i>
and <i>Bibliotheca Botanica</i> appeared in 1736; his <i>Critica
Botanica</i> and <i>Genera Plantarum</i> in 1737; his <i>Classes
Plantarum</i> in 1738; his <i>Species Plantarum</i> was not published
till 1753; and all these works appeared in many successive editions,
materially modified.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note87-16"
href="#fnanchor87-16">87</a></span> Ibid. 234.</div>
<p>This circulation of his works showed that his labors were producing
their effect. His reputation grew; and he was soon enabled to exert a
personal, as well as a literary, influence, on students of natural
history. He became Botanist Royal, President of the Academy of
Sciences at Stockholm, and Professor in the University of Upsal; and
this office he held for thirty-six years with unrivalled credit;
exercising, by means of his lectures, his constant publications, and
his conversation, an extraordinary power over a multitude of zealous
naturalists, belonging to every part of the world.</p>
<p>In order to understand more clearly the nature and effect of the
reforms introduced by Linnæus into botany, I shall consider them under
the four following heads;&#8212;<i>Terminology</i>,
<i>Nomenclature</i>, <i>Artificial System</i>, and <i>Natural
System</i>.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Linnæan Reform of Botanical
Terminology.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">It</span> must be recollected that I
designate as <i>Terminology</i>, the system of <i>terms</i> employed
in the <i>description</i> of objects of natural history; while by
<i>Nomenclature</i>, I mean the collection of the <i>names</i> of
<i>species</i>. The reform of the descriptive part of botany was one
of the tasks first attempted by Linnæus; and his terminology was the
instrument by which his other improvements were effected.</p>
<p>Though most readers, probably, entertain, at first, a persuasion
that a writer ought to content himself with the use of common words in
their common sense, and feel a repugnance to technical terms and
arbitrary rules of phraseology, as pedantic and troublesome; it is
soon found, by the student of any branch of science that, without
technical terms and fixed rules, there can be no certain or
progressive knowledge. The loose and infantine grasp of common
language cannot hold objects steadily enough for scientific
examination, or lift them from one stage of generalization to another.
They must be secured by the rigid mechanism of a scientific
phraseology. This necessity had been felt in all the sciences, from
the earliest periods of their progress. But the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page390">390</a></span> conviction had never
been acted upon so as to produce a distinct and adequate descriptive
botanical language. Jung, indeed,<a id="fnanchor88-16"
href="#note88-16"><span class="fnanchor">88</span></a> had already
attempted to give rules and precepts which should answer this purpose;
but it was not till the <i>Fundamenta Botanica</i> appeared, that the
science could be said to possess a fixed and complete terminology.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note88-16"
href="#fnanchor88-16">88</a></span> <i>Isagoge Phytoscopica</i>,
1679.</div>
<p>To give an account of such a terminology, is, in fact, to give a
description of a dictionary and grammar, and is therefore what cannot
here be done in detail. Linnæus’s work contains about a thousand terms
of which the meaning and application are distinctly explained; and
rules are given, by which, in the use of such terms, the botanist may
avoid all obscurity, ambiguity, unnecessary prolixity and complexity,
and even inelegance and barbarism. Of course the greater part of the
words which Linnæus thus recognized had previously existed in
botanical writers; and many of them had been defined with technical
precision. Thus Jung<a id="fnanchor89-16" href="#note89-16"><span
class="fnanchor">89</span></a> had already explained what was a
<i>composite</i>, what a <i>pinnate</i> leaf; what kind of a bunch of
flowers is a <i>spike</i>, a <i>panicle</i>, an <i>umbel</i>, a
<i>corymb</i>, respectively. Linnæus extended such distinctions,
retaining complete clearness in their separation. Thus, with him,
composite leaves are further distinguished as <i>digitate</i>,
<i>pinnate</i>, <i>bipinnate</i>, <i>pedate</i>, and so on; pinnate
leaves are <i>abruptly</i> so, or <i>with an odd</i> one, or <i>with a
tendril</i>; they are pinnate <i>oppositely</i>, <i>alternately</i>,
<i>interruptedly</i>, <i>articulately</i>, <i>decursively</i>. Again,
the <i>inflorescence</i>, as the mode of assemblage of the flowers is
called, may be a <i>tuft</i> (fasciculus), a <i>head</i> (capitulum),
a <i>cluster</i> (racemus), a <i>bunch</i> (thyrsus), a
<i>panicle</i>, a <i>spike</i>, a <i>catkin</i> (amentum), a
<i>corymb</i>, an <i>umbel</i>, a <i>cyme</i>, a <i>whorl</i>
(verticillus). And the rules which he gives, though often apparently
arbitrary and needless, are found, in practice, to be of great service
by their fixity and connexion. By the good fortune of having had a
teacher with so much delicacy of taste as Linnæus, in a situation of
so much influence, Botany possesses a descriptive language which will
long stand as a model for all other subjects.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note89-16"
href="#fnanchor89-16">89</a></span> Sprengel, ii. 28.</div>
<p>It may, perhaps, appear to some persons, that such a terminology as
we have here described must be enormously cumbrous; and that, since
the terms are arbitrarily invested with their meaning, the invention
of them requires no knowledge of nature. With respect to the former
doubt, we may observe, that technical description is, in reality, the
only description which is clearly intelligible; but that technical
language cannot be understood without being learnt as any other <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page391">391</a></span> language is learnt;
that is, the reader must connect the terms immediately with his own
sensations and notions, and not mediately, through a verbal
explanation; he must not have to guess their meaning, or to discover
it by a separate act of interpretation into more familiar language as
often as they occur. The language of botany must be the botanist’s
most familiar tongue. When the student has thus learnt to
<em>think</em> in botanical language, it is no idle distinction to
tell him that a <em>bunch</em> of grapes is not a <em>cluster</em>;
that is, a <em>thyrsus</em> not a <em>raceme</em>. And the terminology
of botany is then felt to be a useful implement, not an oppressive
burden. It is only the schoolboy that complains of the irksomeness of
his grammar and vocabulary. The accomplished student possesses them
without effort or inconvenience.</p>
<p>As to the other question, whether the construction of such a
botanical grammar and vocabulary implies an extensive and accurate
acquaintance with the facts of nature, no one can doubt who is
familiar with any descriptive science. It is true, that a person might
construct an arbitrary scheme of distinctions and appellations, with
no attention to natural objects; and this is what shallow and
self-confident persons often set about doing, in some branch of
knowledge with which they are imperfectly acquainted. But the
slightest attempt to use such a phraseology leads to confusion; and
any continued use of it leads to its demolition. Like a garment which
does not fit us, if we attempt to work in it we tear it in pieces.</p>
<p>The formation of a good descriptive language is, in fact, an
inductive process of the same kind as those which we have already
noticed in the progress of natural history. It requires the
<i>discovery of fixed characters</i>, which discovery is to be marked
and fixed, like other inductive steps, by appropriate <i>technical
terms</i>. The characters must be so far fixed, that the things which
they connect must have a more permanent and real association than the
things which they leave unconnected. If one bunch of grapes were
really a racemus, and another a thyrsus, according to the definition
of these terms, this part of the Linnæan language would lose its
value; because it would no longer enable us to assert a general
proposition with respect to one kind of plants.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Linnæan Reform of Botanical
Nomenclature.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">In</span> the ancient writers each
recognized kind of plants had a distinct name. The establishment of
Genera led to the practice of designating <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page392">392</a></span> Species by the name of the genus, with
the addition of a “phrase” to distinguish the species. These phrases,
(expressed in Latin in the ablative case,) were such as not only to
mark, but to describe the species, and were intended to contain such
features of the plant as were sufficient to distinguish it from others
of the same genus. But in this way the designation of a plant often
became a long and inconvenient assemblage of words. Thus different
kinds of Rose were described as,</p>
<ul class="lsoff">
<li>Rosa campestris, spinis carens, biflora (<i>Rosa alpina</i>.)</li>
<li>Rosa aculeata, foliis odoratis subtus rubiginosis (<i>R.
eglanteria</i>.)</li>
<li>Rosa carolina fragrans, foliis medio tenus serratis (<i>R.
carolina</i>.)</li>
<li>Rosa sylvestris vulgaris, flore odorato incarnato (<i>R.
canina</i>.)</li></ul>
<p class="noind">And several others. The prolixity of these
appellations, their variety in every different author, the
insufficiency and confusion of the distinctions which they contained,
were felt as extreme inconveniences. The attempt of Bauhin to remedy
this evil by a Synonymy, had, as we have <a
href="#v2page381">seen</a>, failed at the time, for want of any
directing principle; and was become still more defective by the lapse
of years and the accumulation of fresh knowledge and new books. Haller
had proposed to distinguish the species of each genus by the numbers
1, 2, 3, and so on; but botanists found that their memory could not
deal with such arbitrary abstractions. The need of some better
nomenclature was severely felt.</p>
<p>The remedy which Linnæus finally introduced was the use of
<i>trivial</i> names; that is, the designation of each species by the
name of the genus along with a <em>single</em> conventional word,
imposed without any general rule. Such names are added above in
parentheses, to the specimens of the names previously in use. But
though this remedy was found to be complete and satisfactory, and is
now universally adopted in every branch of natural history, it was not
one of the reforms which Linnæus at first proposed. Perhaps he did not
at first see its full value; or, if he did, we may suppose that it
required more self-confidence than he possessed, to set himself to
introduce and establish ten thousand new names in the botanical world.
Accordingly, the first attempts of Linnæus at the improvement of the
nomenclature of botany were, the proposal of fixed and careful rules
for the generic name, and for the descriptive phrase. Thus, in his
<i>Critica Botanica</i>, he gives many precepts concerning the
selection of the names of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page393">393</a></span> genera, intended to secure convenience
or elegance. For instance, that they are to be single words;<a
id="fnanchor90-16" href="#note90-16"><span
class="fnanchor">90</span></a> he substitutes <i>atropa</i> for
<i>bella donna</i>, and <i>leontodon</i> for <i>dens leonis</i>; that
they are not to depend upon the name of another genus,<a
id="fnanchor91-16" href="#note91-16"><span
class="fnanchor">91</span></a> as <i>acriviola</i>,
<i>agrimonoides</i>; that they are not<a id="fnanchor92-16"
href="#note92-16"><span class="fnanchor">92</span></a> to be
“sesquipedalia;” and, says he, any word is sesquipedalian to me, which
has more than twelve letters, as <i>kalophyllodendron</i>, for which
he substitutes <i>calophyllon</i>. Though some of these rules may seem
pedantic, there is no doubt that, taken altogether, they tend
exceedingly, like the labors of purists in other languages, to exclude
extravagance, caprice, and barbarism in botanical speech.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note90-16"

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note92-16"
href="#fnanchor92-16">92</a></span> Ib. 252.</div>
<p>The precepts which he gives for the matter of the “descriptive
phrase,” or, as it is termed in the language of the Aristotelian
logicians, the “differentia,” are, for the most part, results of the
general rule, that the most fixed characters which can be found are to
be used; this rule being interpreted according to all the knowledge of
plants which had then been acquired. The language of the rules was, of
course, to be regulated by the terminology, of which we have already
spoken.</p>
<p>Thus, in the <i>Critica Botanica</i>, the name of a plant is
considered as consisting of a generic word and a specific phrase; and
these are, he says,<a id="fnanchor93-16" href="#note93-16"><span
class="fnanchor">93</span></a> the right and left hands of the plant.
But he then speaks of another kind of name; the <i>trivial</i> name,
which is opposed to the scientific. Such names were, he says,<a
id="fnanchor94-16" href="#note94-16"><span
class="fnanchor">94</span></a> those of his predecessors, and
especially of the most ancient of them. Hitherto<a id="fnanchor95-16"
href="#note95-16"><span class="fnanchor">95</span></a> no rules had
been given for their use. He manifestly, at this period, has small
regard for them. “Yet,” he says, “trivial names may, perhaps, be used
on this account,&#8212;that the <i>differentia</i> often turns out too
long to be convenient in common use, and may require change as new
species are discovered. However,” he continues, “in this work we set
such names aside altogether, and attend only to the
<i>differentiæ</i>.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note93-16"
href="#fnanchor93-16">93</a></span> Ib. 266.</div>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note95-16"
href="#fnanchor95-16">95</a></span> Ib. 260.</div>
<p>Even in the <i>Species Plantarum</i>, the work which gave general
currency to these trivial names, he does not seem to have yet dared to
propose so great a novelty. They only stand in the margin of the work.
“I have placed them there,” he says in his Preface, “that, without
circumlocution, we may call every herb by a single name; I have done
this without selection, which would require more time. And I beseech
all sane botanists to avoid most religiously ever <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page394">394</a></span> proposing a trivial
name without a sufficient specific distinction, lest the science
should fall into its former barbarism.”</p>
<p>It cannot be doubted, that the general reception of these trivial
names of Linnæus, as the current language among botanists, was due, in
a very great degree, to the knowledge, care, and skill with which his
characters, both of genera and of species, were constructed. The
rigorous rules of selection and expression which are proposed in the
<i>Fundamenta Botanica</i> and <i>Critica Botanica</i>, he himself
conformed to; and this scrupulosity was employed upon the results of
immense labor. “In order that I might make myself acquainted with the
species of plants,” he says, in the preface to his work upon them, “I
have explored the Alps of Lapland, the whole of Sweden, a part of
Norway, Denmark, Germany, Belgium, England, France: I have examined
the Botanical Gardens of Paris, Oxford, Chelsea, <span
class="correction" title="corrected from Harlecamp in the 3rd edition

dried plants from various countries: Lagerström many from the East
Indies; Gronovius most of the Virginian; Gmelin all the Siberian;
Burmann those of the Cape.” And in consistency with this habit of
immense collection of materials, is his maxim,<a id="fnanchor96-16"
href="#note96-16"><span class="fnanchor">96</span></a> that “a person
is a better botanist in proportion as he knows more species.” It will
easily be seen that this maxim, like Newton’s declaration that
discovery requires patient thought alone, refers only to the exertions
of which the man of genius is conscious; and leaves out of sight his
peculiar endowments, which he does not see because they are part of
his power of vision. With the taste for symmetry which dictated the
<i>Critica Botanica</i>, and the talent for classification which
appears in the <i>Genera Plantarum</i>, and the <i>Systema Naturæ</i>,
a person must undoubtedly rise to higher steps of classificatory
knowledge and skill, as he became acquainted with a greater number of
facts.</p>

<p>The acknowledged superiority of Linnæus in the knowledge of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page395">395</a></span> matter of his
science, induced other persons to defer to him in what concerned its
form; especially when his precepts were, for the most part,
recommended strongly both by convenience and elegance. The trivial
names of the <i>Species Plantarum</i> were generally received; and
though some of the details may have been altered, the immense
advantage of the scheme ensures its permanence.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 4.&#8212;<i>Linnæus’s Artificial System.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">We</span> have already seen, that,
from the time of Cæsalpinus, botanists had been endeavoring to frame a
systematic arrangement of plants. All such arrangements were
necessarily both artificial and natural: they were <i>artificial</i>,
inasmuch as they depended upon assumed principles, the number, form,
and position of certain parts, by the application of which the whole
vegetable kingdom was imperatively subdivided; they were
<i>natural</i>, inasmuch as the justification of this division was,
that it brought together those plants which were naturally related. No
system of arrangement, for instance, would have been tolerated which,
in a great proportion of cases, separated into distant parts of the
plan the different species of the same genus. As far as the main body
of the genera, at least, all systems are natural.</p>
<p>But beginning from this line, we may construct our systems with two
opposite purposes, according as we endeavor to carry our assumed
principle of division rigorously and consistently through the system,
or as we wish to associate natural families of a wider kind than
genera. The former propensity leads to an artificial, the latter to a
natural method. Each is a <i>System of Plants</i>; but in the first,
the emphasis is thrown on the former word of the title, in the other,
on the latter.</p>
<p>The strongest recommendation of an artificial system, (besides its
approaching to a natural method,) is, that it shall be capable of easy
use; for which purpose, the facts on which it depends must be apparent
in their relations, and universal in their occurrence. The system of
Linnæus, founded upon the number, position, and other circumstances of
the stamina and pistils, the reproductive organs of the plants,
possessed this merit in an eminent degree, as far as these characters
are concerned; that is, as far as the classes and orders. In its
further subdivision into genera, its superiority was mainly due to the
exact observation and description, which we have already had to notice
as talents which Linnæus peculiarly possessed.</p>
<p>The Linnæan system of plants was more definite than that of <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page396">396</a></span> Tournefort, which was
governed by the corolla; for number is more definite than irregular
form. It was more readily employed than any of those which depend on
the fruit, for the flower is a more obvious object, and more easily
examined. Still, it can hardly be doubted, that the circumstance which
gave the main currency to the system of Linnæus was its physiological
signification: it was the <i>Sexual System</i>. The relation of the
parts to which it directed the attention, interested both the
philosophical faculty and the imagination. And when, soon after the
system had become familiar in our own country, the poet of <i>The
Botanic Garden</i> peopled the bell of every flower with “Nymphs” and
“Swains,” his imagery was felt to be by no means forced and
far-fetched.</p>
<p>The history of the doctrine of the sexes of plants, as a point of
physiology, does not belong to this place; and the Linnæan system of
classification need not be longer dwelt upon for our present purpose.
I will only explain a little further what has been said, that it is,
up to a certain point, a natural system. Several of Linnæus’s classes
are, in a great measure, natural associations, kept together in
violation of his own artificial rules. Thus the class
<i>Diadelphia</i>, in which, by the system, the filaments of the
stamina should be bound together in two parcels, does, in fact,
contain many genera which are<i> monadelphous</i>, the filaments of
the stamina all cohering so as to form one bundle only; as in
<i>Genista</i>, <i>Spartium</i>, <i>Anthyllis</i>, <i>Lupinus</i>,
&amp;c. And why is this violation of rule? Precisely because these
genera all belong to the natural tribe of Papilionaceous plants, which
the author of the system could not prevail upon himself to tear
asunder. Yet in other cases Linnæus was true to his system, to the
injury of natural alliances, as he was, for instance, in another
portion of this very tribe of <i>Papilionaceæ</i>; for there are
plants which undoubtedly belong to the tribe, but which have ten
separate stamens; and these he placed in the order <i>Decandria</i>.
Upon the whole, however, he inclines rather to admit transgression of
art than of nature.</p>
<p>The reason of this inclination was, that he rightly considered an
artificial method as instrumental to the investigation of a natural
one; and to this part of his views we now proceed.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 5.&#8212;<i>Linnæus’s Views on a Natural
Method.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> admirers of Linnæus, the
English especially, were for some time in the habit of putting his
Sexual System in opposition to the Natural Method, which about the
same time was attempted in France. And <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page397">397</a></span> as they often appear to have imagined
that the ultimate object of botanical methods was to know the name of
plants, they naturally preferred the Swedish method, which is
excellent as a <i>finder</i>. No person, however, who wishes to know
botany as a science, that is, as a body of general truths, can be
content with making names his ultimate object. Such a person will be
constantly and irresistibly led on to attempt to catch sight of the
natural arrangement of plants, even before he discovers, as he will
discover by pursuing such a course of study, that the knowledge of the
natural arrangement is the knowledge of the essential construction and
vital mechanism of plants. He will consider an artificial method as a
means of arriving at a natural method. Accordingly, however much some
of his followers may have overlooked this, it is what Linnæus himself
always held and taught. And though what he executed with regard to
this object was but little,<a id="fnanchor97-16"
href="#note97-16"><span class="fnanchor">97</span></a> the distinct
manner in which he presented the relations of an artificial and
natural method, may justly be looked upon as one of the great
improvements which he introduced into the study of his science.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note97-16"
href="#fnanchor97-16">97</a></span> The natural orders which he
proposed are a bare enumeration of genera, and have not been generally
followed.</div>
<p>Thus in the <i>Classes Plantarum</i> (1747), he speaks of the
difficulty of the task of discovering the natural orders, and of the
attempts made by others. “Yet,” he adds, “I too have labored at this,
have done something, have much still to do, and shall labor at the
object as long as I live.” He afterwards proposed sixty-seven orders,
as the fragments of a natural method, always professing their
imperfection.<a id="fnanchor98-16" href="#note98-16"><span
class="fnanchor">98</span></a> And in others of his works<a
id="fnanchor99-16" href="#note99-16"><span
class="fnanchor">99</span></a> he lays down some antitheses on the
subject after his manner. “The natural orders teach us the nature of
plants; the artificial orders enable us to recognize plants. The
natural orders, without a key, do not constitute a Method; the Method
ought to be available without a master.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note98-16"
href="#fnanchor98-16">98</a></span> <i>Phil. Bot.</i> p. 80.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note99-16"
href="#fnanchor99-16">99</a></span> <i>Genera Plantarum</i>, 1764. See
<i>Prælect. in Ord. Nat.</i> p. xlviii.</div>
<p>That extreme difficulty must attend the formation of a Natural
Method, may be seen from the very indefinite nature of the Aphorisms
upon this subject which Linnæus has delivered, and which the best
botanists of succeeding times have assented to. Such are
these;&#8212;the Natural Orders must be formed by attention, not to
one or two, but to <em>all</em> the parts of plants;&#8212;the same
organs are of great importance in regulating the divisions of one part
of the system, and <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page398">398</a></span> of small importance in another part;<a
id="fnanchor100-16" href="#note100-16"><span
class="fnanchor">100</span></a>&#8212;the Character does not
constitute the Genus, but the Genus the Character;&#8212;the Character
is necessary, not to make the Genus, but to recognize it. The
vagueness of these maxims is easily seen; the rule of attending to all
the parts, implies, that we are to estimate their relative importance,
either by physiological considerations (and these again lead to
arbitrary rules, as, for instance, the superiority of the function of
nutrition to that of reproduction), or by a sort of latent naturalist
instinct, which Linnæus in some passages seems to recognize. “The
Habit of a plant,” he says,<a id="fnanchor101-16"
href="#note101-16"><span class="fnanchor">101</span></a> “must be
secretly consulted. A practised botanist will distinguish, at the
first glance, the plants of different quarters of the globe, and yet
will be at a loss to tell by what mark he detects them. There is, I
know not what look,&#8212;sinister, dry, obscure in African plants;
superb and elevated, in the Asiatic; smooth and cheerful, in the
American; stunted and indurated, in the Alpine.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note100-16"
href="#fnanchor100-16">100</a></span> <i>Phil. Bot.</i> p. 172.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note101-16"
href="#fnanchor101-16">101</a></span> Ib. p. 171.</div>
<p>Again, the rule that the same parts are of very different value in
different Orders, not only leaves us in want of rules or reasons which
may enable us to compare the marks of different Orders, but destroys
the systematic completeness of the natural arrangement. If some of the
Orders be regulated by the flower and others by the fruit, we may have
plants, of which the flower would place them in one Order, and the
fruit in another. The answer to this difficulty is the maxim already
stated;&#8212;that no Character <em>makes</em> the Order; and that if a
Character do not enable us to recognize the Order, it does not answer
its purpose, and ought to be changed for another.</p>
<p>This doctrine, that the Character is to be employed as a servant
and not as a master, was a stumbling-block in the way of those
disciples who looked only for dogmatical and universal rules. One of
Linnæus’s pupils, Paul Dietrich Giseke, has given us a very lively
account of his own perplexity on having this view propounded to him,
and of the way in which he struggled with it. He had complained of the
want of intelligible grounds, in the collection of natural orders
given by Linnæus. Linnæus<a id="fnanchor102-16"
href="#note102-16"><span class="fnanchor">102</span></a> wrote in
answer, “You ask me for the characters of the Natural Orders: I
confess I cannot give them.” Such a reply naturally increased Giseke’s
difficulties. But afterwards, in 1771, he had the good fortune to
spend some time at Upsal; and he narrates a conversation which he held
with the great <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page399">399</a></span>
teacher on this subject, and which I think may serve to show the
nature of the difficulty;&#8212;one by no means easily removed, and by
the general reader, not even readily comprehended with distinctness.
Giseke began by conceiving that an Order <em>must</em> have that
attribute from which its name is derived;&#8212;that the
<i>Umbellatæ</i> must have their flower disposed in an umbel. The
“mighty master” smiled,<a id="fnanchor103-16" href="#note103-16"><span
class="fnanchor">103</span></a> and told him not to look at names, but
at nature. “But” (said the pupil) “what is the use of the name, if it
does not mean what it professes to mean?” “It is of small import”
(replied Linnæus) “<em>what</em> you <em>call</em> the Order, if you
take a proper series of plants and give it some name, which is clearly
understood to apply to the plants which you have associated. In such
cases as you refer to, I followed the logical rule, of borrowing a
name <i>a potiori</i>, from the principal member. Can you” (he added)
“give me the character of any single Order?” <i>Giseke.</i> “Surely,
the character of the <i>Umbellatæ</i> is, that they have an umbel?”
<i>Linnæus.</i> “Good; but there are plants which have an umbel, and
are not of the <i>Umbellatæ</i>.” <i>G.</i> “I remember. We must
therefore add, that they have two naked seeds.” <i>L.</i> “Then,
<i>Echinophora</i>, which has only one seed, and <i>Eryngium</i>,
which has not an umbel, will not be <i>Umbellatæ</i>; and yet they are
of the Order.” <i>G.</i> “I would place <i>Eryngium</i> among the
<i>Aggregatæ</i>. <i>L.</i> “No; both are beyond dispute
<i>Umbellatæ</i>. <i>Eryngium</i> has an involucrum, five stamina, two
pistils, &amp;c. Try again for your Character.” <i>G.</i> “I would
transfer such plants to the end of the Order, and make them form the
transition to the next Order. <i>Eryngium</i> would connect the
<i>Umbellatæ</i> with the <i>Aggregatæ</i>.” <i>L.</i> “Ah! my good
friend, the <i>Transition</i> from Order to Order is one thing; the
<i>Character</i> of an Order is another. The Transitions I could
indicate; but a Character of a Natural Order is impossible. I will not
give my reasons for the distribution of Natural Orders which I have
published. You or some other person, after twenty or after fifty
years, will discover them, and see I was in the right.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note102-16"

Pref. p. xv.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note103-16"
href="#fnanchor103-16">103</a></span> “Subrisit ὁ πανυ.”</div>
<p>I have given a portion of this curious conversation in order to
show that the attempt to establish Natural Orders leads to convictions
which are out of the domain of the systematic grounds on which they
profess to proceed. I believe the real state of the case to be that
the systematist, in such instances, is guided by an unformed and
undeveloped apprehension of physiological functions. The ideas of the
form, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page400">400</a></span> number,
and figure of parts are, in some measure, overshadowed and superseded
by the rising perception of organic and vital relations; and the
philosopher who aims at a Natural Method, while he is endeavoring
merely to explore the apartment in which he had placed himself, that
of Arrangement, is led beyond it, to a point where another light
begins, though dimly, to be seen; he is brought within the influence
of the ideas of Organization and Life.</p>
<p>The sciences which depend on these ideas will be the subject of our
consideration hereafter. But what has been said may perhaps serve to
explain the acknowledged and inevitable imperfection of the
unphysiological Linnæan attempts towards a natural method. “Artificial
Glasses are,” Linnæus says, “a substitute for Natural, till Natural
are detected.” But we have not yet a Natural Method. “Nor,” he says,
in the conversation above cited, “can we have a Natural Method; for a
Natural Method implies Natural Classes and Orders; and these Orders
must have Characters.” “And they,” he adds in another place,<a
id="fnanchor104-16" href="#note104-16"><span
class="fnanchor">104</span></a> “who, though they cannot obtain a
complete Natural Method, arrange plants according to the fragments of
such a method, to the rejection of the Artificial, seem to me like
persons who pull down a convenient vaulted room, and set about
building another, though they cannot turn the vault which is to cover
it.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note104-16"
href="#fnanchor104-16">104</a></span> <i>Gen. Plant. in Prælect.</i>
p. xii.</div>
<p>How far these considerations deterred other persons from turning
their main attention to a natural method, we shall shortly see; but in
the mean time, we must complete the history of the Linnæan Reform.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 6.&#8212;<i>Reception and Diffusion of the Linnæan
Reform.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">We</span> have already seen that
Linnæus received, from his own country, honors and emoluments which
mark his reputation as established, as early as 1740; and by his
publications, his lectures, and his personal communications, he soon
drew round him many disciples, whom he impressed strongly with his own
doctrines and methods. It would seem that the sciences of
classification tend, at least in modern times more than other
sciences, to collect about the chair of the teacher a large body of
zealous and obedient pupils; Linnæus and Werner were by far the most
powerful heads of schools of any men who appeared in the course of the
last century. Perhaps one reason of this is, that in these sciences,
consisting of such an enormous multitude of species, of descriptive
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page401">401</a></span> particulars,
and of previous classifications, the learner is dependent upon the
teacher more completely, and for a longer time than in other subjects
of speculation: he cannot so soon or so easily cast off the aid and
influence of the master, to pursue reasonings and hypotheses of his
own. Whatever the cause may be, the fact is, that the reputation and
authority of Linnæus, in the latter part of his life, were immense. He
enjoyed also royal favor, for the King and Queen of Sweden were both
fond of natural history. In 1753, Linnæus received from the hand of
his sovereign the knighthood of the Polar Star, an honor which had
never before been conferred for literary merit; and in 1756, was
raised to the rank of Swedish nobility by the title of Von Linné; and
this distinction was confirmed by the Diet in 1762. He lived, honored
and courted, to the age of seventy-one; and in 1778 was buried in the
cathedral of Upsal, with many testimonials of public respect and
veneration.</p>
<p>De Candolle<a id="fnanchor105-16" href="#note105-16"><span
class="fnanchor">105</span></a> assigns, as the causes of the
successes of the Linnæan system,&#8212;the specific names,&#8212;the
characteristic phrase,&#8212;the fixation of descriptive
language,&#8212;the distinction of varieties and species,&#8212;the
extension of the method to all the kingdoms of nature,&#8212;and the
practice of introducing into it the species most recently discovered.
This last course Linnæus constantly pursued; thus making his works the
most valuable for matter, as they were the most convenient in form.
The general diffusion of his methods over Europe may be dated,
perhaps, a few years after 1760, when the tenth and the succeeding
editions of the <i>Systema Naturæ</i> were in circulation, professing
to include every species of organized beings. But his pupils and
correspondents effected no less than his books, in giving currency to
his system. In Germany,<a id="fnanchor106-16" href="#note106-16"><span
class="fnanchor">106</span></a> it was defended by Ludwig, Gesner,
Fabricius. But Haller, whose reputation in physiology was as great as
that of Linnæus in methodology, rejected it as too merely artificial.
In France, it did not make any rapid or extensive progress: the best
French botanists were at this time occupied with the solution of the
great problem of the construction of a Natural Method. And though the
rhetorician Rousseau charmed, we may suppose, with the elegant
precision of the <i>Philosophia Botanica</i>, declared it to be the
most philosophical work he had ever read in his life, Buffon and
Andanson, describers and philosophers of a more ambitious school, felt
a repugnance to the rigorous rules, and limited, but finished,
undertakings of the Swedish naturalist. To resist his <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page402">402</a></span> criticism and his
influence, they armed themselves with dislike and contempt.</p>

<p>In England the Linnæan system was very favorably
received:&#8212;perhaps the more favorably, for being a strictly
artificial system. For the indefinite and unfinished form which almost
inevitably clings to a natural method, appears to be peculiarly
distasteful to our countrymen. It might seem as if the suspense and
craving which comes with knowledge confessedly incomplete were so
disagreeable to them, that they were willing to avoid it, at any rate
whatever; either by rejecting system altogether, or by accepting a
dogmatical system without reserve. The former has been their course in
recent times with regard to Mineralogy; the latter was their
proceeding with respect to the Linnæan Botany. It is in this country
alone, I believe, that <i>Wernerian</i> and <i>Linnæan</i> Societies have been
instituted. Such appellations somewhat remind us of the Aristotelian
and Platonic schools of ancient Greece. In the same spirit it was,
that the Artificial System was at one time here considered, not as
subsidiary and preparatory to the Natural Orders, but as opposed to
them. This was much as if the disposition of an army in a review
should be considered as inconsistent with another arrangement of it in
a battle.</p>
<p>When Linnæus visited England in 1736, Sloane, then the patron of
natural history in this country, is said to have given him a cool
reception, such as was perhaps most natural from an old man to a young
innovator; and Dillenius, the Professor at Oxford, did not accept the
sexual system. But as Pulteney, the historian of English Botany, says,
when his works became known, “the simplicity of the classical
characters, the uniformity of the generic notes, all confined to the
parts of the fructification, and the precision which marked the
specific distinctions, merits so new, soon commanded the assent of the
unprejudiced.”</p>
<p>Perhaps the progress of the introduction of the Linnæan System into
England will be best understood from the statement of T. Martyn, who
was Professor of Botany in the University of Cambridge, from 1761 to
1825. “About the year 1750,” he says,<a id="fnanchor107-16"
href="#note107-16"><span class="fnanchor">107</span></a> “I was a
pupil of the school of our great countryman Ray; but the rich vein of
knowledge, the profoundness and precision, which I remarked everywhere
in the <i>Philosophia Botanica</i>, (published in 1751,) withdrew me
from my first master, and I became a decided convert to that system of
botany which has since been generally received. In 1753, the
<i>Species</i> <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page403">403</a></span>
<i>Plantarum</i>, which first introduced the specific names, made me a
Linnæan completely.” In 1763, he introduced the system in his lectures
at Cambridge, and these were the first Linnæan lectures in England.
Stillingfleet had already, in 1757, and Lee, in 1760, called the
attention of English readers to Linnæus. Sir J. Hill, (the king’s
gardener at Kew,) in his <i>Flora Britannica</i>, published in 1760,
had employed the classes and generic characters, but not the
nomenclature; but the latter was adopted by Hudson, in 1762, in the
<i>Flora Anglica</i>.</p>

href="#fnanchor107-16">107</a></span> Pref. to <i>Language of
Botany</i>, 3rd edit. 1807.</div>
<p>Two young Swedes, pupils of Linnæus, Dryander and Solander, settled
in England, and were in intimate intercourse with the most active
naturalists, especially with Sir Joseph Banks, of whom the former was
librarian, and the latter a fellow-traveller in Cook’s celebrated
voyage. James Edward Smith was also one of the most zealous disciples
of the Linnæan school; and, after the death of Linnæus, purchased his
Herbariums and Collections. It is related,<a id="fnanchor108-16"
href="#note108-16"><span class="fnanchor">108</span></a> as a curious
proof of the high estimation in which Linnæus was held, that when the
Swedish government heard of this bargain, they tried, though too late,
to prevent these monuments of their countryman’s labor and glory being
carried from his native land, and even went so far as to send a
frigate in pursuit of the ship which conveyed them to England. Smith
had, however, the triumph of bringing them home in safety. On his
death they were purchased by the Linnæan Society. Such relics serve,
as will easily be imagined, not only to warm the reverence of his
admirers, but to illustrate his writings: and since they have been in
this country, they have been the object of the pilgrimage of many a
botanist, from every part of Europe.</p>

<p>I have purposely confined myself to the history of the Linnæan
system in the cases in which it is most easily applicable, omitting
all consideration of more obscure and disputed kinds of vegetables, as
ferns, mosses, fungi, lichens, sea-weeds, and the like. The nature and
progress of a classificatory science, which it is our main purpose to
bring into view, will best be understood by attending, in the first
place, to the cases in which such a science has been pursued with the
most decided success; and the advances which have been made in the
knowledge of the more obscure vegetables, are, in fact, advances in
artificial classification, only in as far as they are advances in
natural classification, and in physiology.</p>
<p>To these subjects we now proceed. <span class="pagenum"><a

<h3 class="space-above">CHAPTER V.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Progress towards a Natural System of
Botany.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">WE</span> have already said, that the
formation of a Natural System of classification must result from a
comparison of <em>all</em> the resemblances and differences of the
things classed; but that, in acting upon this maxim, the naturalist is
necessarily either guided by an obscure and instinctive feeling, which
is, in fact, an undeveloped recognition of physiological relations, or
else acknowledges physiology for his guide, though he is obliged to
assume arbitrary rules in order to interpret its indications. Thus all
Natural Classification of organized beings, either begins or soon ends
in Physiology; and can never advance far without the aid of that
science. Still, the progress of the Natural Method in botany went to
such a length before it was grounded entirely on the anatomy of
plants, that it will be proper, and I hope instructive, to attempt a
sketch of it here.</p>
<p>As I have already had occasion to remark, the earlier systems of
plants were natural; and they only ceased to be so, when it appeared
that the problem of constructing a <i>system</i> admitted of a very
useful solution, while the problem of devising a <i>natural system</i>
remained insoluble. But many botanists did not so easily renounce the
highest object of their science. In France, especially, a succession
of extraordinary men labored at it with no inconsiderable success: and
they were seconded by worthy fellow-laborers in Germany and
elsewhere.</p>
<p>The precept of taking into account all the parts of plants
according to their importance, may be applied according to arbitrary
rules. We may, for instance, assume that the fruit is the most
important part; or we may make a long list of parts, and look for
agreement in the greatest possible number of these, in order to
construct our natural orders. The former course was followed by
Gærtner;<a id="fnanchor109-16" href="#note109-16"><span
class="fnanchor">109</span></a> the latter by Adanson. Gærtner’s
principles, deduced from the dissection of more than a thousand kinds
of fruits,<a id="fnanchor110-16" href="#note110-16"><span
class="fnanchor">110</span></a> exercised, in the sequel, a great and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page405">405</a></span> permanent
influence on the formation of natural classes. Adanson’s attempt, bold
and ingenious, belonged, both in time and character, to a somewhat
earlier stage of the subject.<a id="fnanchor111-16"
href="#note111-16"><span class="fnanchor">111</span></a> Enthusiastic
and laborious beyond belief but self-confident, and contemptuous of
the labors of others, Michael Adanson had collected, during five years
spent in Senegal, an enormous mass of knowledge and materials; and had
formed plans for the systems which he conceived himself thus empowered
to reach, far beyond the strength and the lot of man.<a
id="fnanchor112-16" href="#note112-16"><span
class="fnanchor">112</span></a> In his <i>Families of Plants</i>,
however, all agree that his labors were of real value to the science.
The method which he followed is thus described by his eloquent and
philosophical eulogist.<a id="fnanchor113-16" href="#note113-16"><span

<p>Considering each organ by itself, he formed, by pursuing its
various modifications, a system of division, in which he arranged all
known species according to that organ alone. Doing the same for
another organ, and another, and so for many, he constructed a
collection of systems of arrangement, each artificial,&#8212;each
founded upon one assumed organ. The species which come together in all
these systems are, of all, naturally the nearest to each other; those
which are separated in a few of the systems, but contiguous in the
greatest number, are naturally near to each other, though less near
than the former; those which are separated in a greater number, are
further removed from each other in nature; and they are the more
removed, the fewer are the systems in which they are associated.</p>
<p>Thus, by this method, we obtain the means of estimating precisely
the degree of natural affinity of all the species which our systems
include, independent of a physiological knowledge of the influence of
the organs. But the method has, Cuvier adds, the inconvenience of
presupposing another kind of knowledge, which, though it belongs only
to descriptive natural history, is no less difficult to
obtain;&#8212;the knowledge, namely, of all species, and of all the
organs of each. A single one neglected, may lead to relations the most
false; and Adanson himself, in spite of the immense number of his
observations, exemplifies this in some instances.</p>
<p>We may add, that in the division of the structure into organs, and
in the estimation of the gradations of these in each artificial
system, there is still room for arbitrary assumption.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the two Jussieus had presented to the world a
“Natural Method,” which produced a stronger impression than the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page406">406</a></span> “Universal Method” of
Adanson. The first author of the system was Bernard de Jussieu, who
applied it in the arrangement of the garden of the Trianon, in 1759,
though he never published upon it. His nephew, Antoine Laurent de
Jussieu, in his <i>Treatise of the Arrangement of the Trianon</i>,<a
id="fnanchor114-16" href="#note114-16"><span
class="fnanchor">114</span></a> gave an account of the principles and
orders of his uncle, which he adopted when he succeeded him; and, at a
later period, published his <i>Genera Plantarum secundum Ordines
Naturales disposita</i>; a work, says Cuvier, which perhaps forms as
important an epoch in the sciences of observation, as the
<i>Chimie</i> of Lavoisier does in the sciences of experiment. The
object of the Jussieus was to obtain a system which should be governed
by the natural affinities of the plants, while, at the same time, the
characters by which the orders were ostensibly determined, should be
as clear, simple, and precise, as those of the best artificial system.
The main points in these characters were the number of the cotyledons,
and the structure of the seed: and subordinate to this, the insertion
of the stamina, which they distinguished as <i>epigynous</i>,
<i>perigynous</i>, and <i>hypogynous</i>, according as they were
inserted over, about, or under, the germen. And the classes which were
formed by the Jussieus, though they have since been modified by
succeeding writers, have been so far retained by the most profound
botanists, notwithstanding all the new care and new light which have
been bestowed upon the subject, as to show that what was done at
first, was a real and important step in the solution of the
problem.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note114-16"
href="#fnanchor114-16">114</a></span> <i>Mém. Ac. P.</i> 1774.</div>
<p>The merit of the formation of this natural method of plants must be
divided between the two Jussieus. It has been common to speak of the
nephew, Antoine Laurent, as only the publisher of his uncle’s work.<a
id="fnanchor115-16" href="#note115-16"><span
class="fnanchor">115</span></a> But this appears, from a recent
statement,<a id="fnanchor116-16" href="#note116-16"><span
class="fnanchor">116</span></a> to be highly unjust. Bernard left
nothing in writing but the catalogues of the garden of the Trianon,
which he had arranged according to his own views; but these catalogues
consist merely of a series of names without explanation or reason
added. The nephew, in 1773, undertook and executed for himself the
examination of a natural family, the <i>Ranunculaceæ</i>; and he was
wont to relate (as his son informs us) that it <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page407">407</a></span> was this employment
which first opened his eyes and rendered him a botanist. In the memoir
which he wrote, he explained fully the relative importance of the
characters of plants, and the subordination of some to
others;&#8212;an essential consideration, which Adanson’s scheme had
failed to take account of. The uncle died in 1777; and his nephew, in
speaking of him, compares his arrangement to the <i>Ordines
Naturales</i> of Linnæus: “Both these authors,” he says, “have
satisfied themselves with giving a catalogue of genera which approach
each other in different points, without explaining the motives which
induced them to place one order before another, or to arrange a genus
under a certain order. These two arrangements may be conceived as
problems which their authors have left for botanists to solve. Linnæus
published his; that of M. de Jussieu is only known by the manuscript
catalogues of the garden of the Trianon.”</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note116-16"
href="#fnanchor116-16">116</a></span> By Adrien de Jussieu, son of
Antoine Laurent, in the <i>Annales des Sc. Nat.</i>, Nov. 1834.</div>
<p>It was not till the younger Jussieu had employed himself for
nineteen years upon botany, that he published, in 1789, his <i>Genera
Plantarum</i>; and by this time he had so entirely formed his scheme
in his head, that he began the impression without having written the
book, and the manuscript was never more than two pages in advance of
the printer’s type.</p>
<p>When this work appeared, it was not received with any enthusiasm;
indeed, at that time, the revolution of states absorbed the thoughts
of all Europe, and left men little leisure to attend to the
revolutions of science. The author himself was drawn into the vortex
of public affairs, and for some years forgot his book. The method made
its way slowly and with difficulty: it was a long time before it was
comprehended and adopted in France, although the botanists of that
country had, a little while before, been so eager in pursuit of a
natural system. In England and Germany, which had readily received the
Linnæan method, its progress was still more tardy.</p>
<p>There is only one point, on which it appears necessary further to
dwell. A main and fundamental distinction in all natural systems, is
that of the Monocotyledonous and Dicotyledonous plants; that is,
plants which unfold themselves from an embryo with two little leaves,
or with one leaf only. This distinction produces its effects in the
systems which are regulated by numbers; for the flowers and fruit of
the monocotyledons are generally referrible to some law in which the
number <i>three</i> prevails; a type which rarely occurs in
dicotyledons, these affecting most commonly an arrangement founded on
the number <i>five</i>. But it appears, when we attempt to rise
towards a natural <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page408">408</a></span> method, that this division according to
the cotyledons is of a higher order than the other divisions according
to number; and corresponds to a distinction in the general structure
and organization of the plant. The apprehension of the due rank of
this distinction has gradually grown clearer. Cuvier<a
id="fnanchor117-16" href="#note117-16"><span
class="fnanchor">117</span></a> conceives that he finds such a
division clearly marked in Lobel, in 1581, and employed by Ray as the
basis of his classification a century later. This difference has had
its due place assigned it in more recent systems of arrangement; but
it is only later still that its full import has been distinctly
brought into view. Desfontaines discovered<a id="fnanchor118-16"
href="#note118-16"><span class="fnanchor">118</span></a> that the
ligneous fibre is developed in an opposite manner in vegetables with
one and with two cotyledons;&#8212;towards the inside in the former
case, and towards the outside in the latter; and hence these two great
classes have been since termed <i>endogenous</i> and <i>exogenous</i>.

<p>Thus this division, according to the cotyledons, appears to have
the stamp of reality put upon it, by acquiring a physiological
meaning. Yet we are not allowed to forget, even at this elevated point
of generalization, that <em>no one</em> character can be imperative in
a natural method. Lamarck, who employed his great talents on botany,
before he devoted himself exclusively to other branches of natural
history, published his views concerning methods, systems,<a
id="fnanchor119-16" href="#note119-16"><span
class="fnanchor">119</span></a> and characters. His main principle is,
that no single part of a plant, however essential, can be an absolute
rule for classification; and hence he blames the Jussieuian method, as
giving this inadmissible authority to the cotyledons. Roscoe<a
id="fnanchor120-16" href="#note120-16"><span
class="fnanchor">120</span></a> further urges that some plants, as
<i>Orchis morio</i>, and <i>Limodorum verecundum</i>, have no visible
cotyledons. Yet De Candolle, who labored along with Lamarck, in the
new edition of the <i>Flore Française</i>, has, as we have already
intimated, been led, by the most careful application of the wisest
principles, to a system of Natural Orders, of which Jussieu’s may be
looked upon as the basis; and we shall find the greatest botanists, up
to the most recent period, recognizing, and employing themselves in
improving, Jussieu’s Natural Families; so that in the progress of this
part of our knowledge, vague and perplexing as it is, we have no
exception to our general aphorism, that no real acquisition in science
is ever discarded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page409">409</a></span> The
reception of the system of Jussieu in this country was not so ready
and cordial as that of Linnæus. As we have already noticed, the two
systems were looked upon as rivals. Thus Roscoe, in 1810,<a
id="fnanchor121-16" href="#note121-16"><span
class="fnanchor">121</span></a> endeavored to show that Jussieu’s
system was not more natural than the Linnæan, and was inferior as an
artificial system: but he argues his points as if Jussieu’s characters
were the grounds of his distribution; which, as we have said, is to
mistake the construction of a natural system. In 1803, Salisbury<a
id="fnanchor122-16" href="#note122-16"><span
class="fnanchor">122</span></a> had already assailed the machinery of
the system, maintaining that there are no cases of perigynous stamens,
as Jussieu assumes; but this he urges with great expressions of
respect for the author of the method. And the more profound botanists
of England soon showed that they could appreciate and extend the
natural method. Robert Brown, who had accompanied Captain Flinders to
New Holland in 1801, and who, after examining that country, brought
home, in 1805, nearly four thousand species of plants, was the most
distinguished example of this. In his preface to the <i>Prodromus
Floræ Novæ Hollandiæ</i>, he says, that he found himself under the
necessity of employing the natural method, as the only way of avoiding
serious error, when he had to deal with so many new genera as occur in
New Holland; and that he has, therefore, followed the method of
Jussieu; the greater part of whose orders are truly natural, “although
their arrangement in classes, as is,” he says, “conceded by their
author, no less candid than learned, is often artificial, and, as
appears to me, rests on doubtful grounds.”</p>

<p>From what has already been said, the reader will, I trust, see what
an extensive and exact knowledge of the vegetable world, and what
comprehensive views of affinity, must be requisite in a person who has
to modify the natural system so as to make it suited to receive and
arrange a great number of new plants, extremely different from the
genera on which the arrangement was first formed, as the New Holland
genera for the most part were. He will also see how impossible it must
be to convey by extract or description any notion of the nature of
these modifications: it is enough to say, that they have excited the
applause of botanists wherever the science is studied, and that they
have induced M. de Humboldt and his fellow-laborers, themselves
botanists of the first rank, to dedicate one of their works to him in
terms of the strongest admiration.<a id="fnanchor123-16"

<p>We have, I think, been led, by our survey of the history of Botany,
to this point;&#8212;that a Natural Method directs us to the study of
Physiology, as the only means by which we can reach the object. This
conviction, which in botany comes at the end of a long series of
attempts at classification, offers itself at once in the natural
history of animals, where the physiological signification of the
resemblances and differences is so much more obvious. I shall not,
therefore, consider any of these branches of natural history in detail
as examples of mere classification. They will come before us, if at
all, more properly when we consider the classifications which depend
on the functions of organs, and on the corresponding modifications
which they necessarily undergo; that is, when we trace the results of
Physiology. But before we proceed to sketch the history of that part
of our knowledge, there are a few points in the progress of Zoology,
understood as a mere classificatory science, which appear to me
sufficiently instructive to make it worth our while to dwell upon
them.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [Mr. Lindley’s recent work, <i>The Vegetable Kingdom</i>
(1846), may be looked upon as containing the best view of the recent
history of Systematic Botany. In the Introduction to this work, Mr.
Lindley has given an account of various recent works on the subject;
as Agardh’s <i>Classes Plantarum</i> (1826); Perleb’s <i>Lehrbuch der
Naturgeschichte der Pflanzenreich</i> (1826); Dumortier’s <i>Florula
Belgica</i> (1827); Bartling’s <i>Ordines Naturales Plantarum</i>
(1830); Hess’s <i>Uebersicht der Phanerogenischen Natürlichen
Pflanzenfamilien</i> (1832); Schulz’s <i>Natürliches System des
Pflanzenreich’s</i> (1832); Horaninow’s <i>Primæ Lineæ Systematis
Naturæ</i> (1834); Fries’s <i>Corpus Florarum provincialium Sueciæ</i>
(1835); Martins’s <i>Conspectus Regni Vegetablis secundum Characteres
Morphologicos</i> (1835); Sir Edward F. Bromhead’s System, as
published in the <i>Edinburgh Journal</i> and other Journals
(1836&#8211;1840); Endlicher’s <i>Genera Plantarum secundum Ordines
Naturales disposita</i> (1836&#8211;1840); Perleb’s <i>Clavis Classicum
Ordinum et Familiarum</i> (1838); Adolphe Brongniart’s <i>Enumération
des Genres de Plantes</i> (1843); Meisner’s <i>Plantarum vascularium
Genera secundum Ordines Naturales digesta</i> (1843); Horaninow’s
<i>Tetractys Naturæ, seu Systema quinquemembre omnium Naturalium</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page411">411</a></span> (1843); Adrien
de Jussieu’s <span class="correction" title="emended from Couérs
Elmentaire"><i>Cours Elémentaire</i></span> <i>d’Histoire Naturelle.
Botanique</i> (1844).</p>
<p>Mr. Lindley, in this as in all his works, urges strongly the
superior value of natural as compared with artificial systems; his
principles being, I think, nearly such as I have attempted to
establish in the <i>Philosophy of the Sciences</i>, Book viii.,
Chapter ii. He states that the leading idea which has been kept in
view in the compilation of his work is this maxim of Fries: “Singula
sphæra (sectio) <em>ideam quandam</em> exponit, indeque ejus character
notione simplici optime exprimitur;” and he is hence led to think that
the true characters of all natural assemblages are extremely
simple.</p>
<p>One of the leading features in Mr. Lindley’s system is that he has
thrown the Natural Orders into groups subordinate to the higher
divisions of Classes and Sub-classes. He had already attempted this,
in imitation of Agardh and Bartling, in his <i>Nixus Plantarum</i>
(1838). The groups of Natural Orders were there called <i>Nixus</i>
(tendencies); and they were denoted by names ending in <i>ales</i>;
but these groups were further subordinated to <i>Cohorts</i>. Thus the
first member of the arrangement was Class 1. <span
class="sc">Exogenæ</span>. Sub-class 1. <span
class="sc">Polypetalæ</span>. Cohort 1. <span
class="sc">Albuminosæ</span>. <i>Nixus</i> 1. <i>Ranales</i>. Natural
Orders included in this <i>Nixus</i>, Ranunculaceæ, Saraceniceæ,
Papaveraceæ, &amp;c. In the <i>Vegetable Kingdom</i>, the groups of
Natural Orders are termed <i>Alliances</i>. In this work, the
Sub-classes of the <span class="sc">Exogens</span> are four: <span
class="sc">i. Diclinous</span>; <span class="sc">ii.
Hypogynous</span>; <span class="sc">iii. Perigynous</span>;  <span
class="sc">iv. Epigynous</span>; and the Alliances are subordinated to
these without the intervention of <i>Cohorts</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Lindley has also, in this as in other works, given English
names for the Natural Orders. Thus for <i>Nymphaceæ</i>,
<i>Ranunculaceæ</i>, <i>Tamaricaceæ</i>, <i>Zygophyllaceæ</i>,
<i>Eleatrinaceæ</i>, he substitutes Water-Lilies, Crowfoots,
Tamarisks, Bean-Capers, and Water-Peppers; for <i>Malvaceæ</i>,
<i>Aurantiaceæ</i>, <i>Gentianaceæ</i>, <i>Primulaceæ</i>,
<i>Urtiaceæ</i>, <i>Euphorbiaceæ</i>, he employs Mallow-worts,
Citron-worts, Gentian-worts, Prim-worts, Nettle-worts, Spurge-worts;
and the terms Orchids, Hippurids, Amaryllids, Irids, Typhads, Arads,
Cucurbits, are taken as English equivalents for <i>Orchidaceæ</i>,
<i>Haloragaceæ</i>, <i>Amaryllidaceæ</i>, <i>Iridaceæ</i>,
<i>Typhaceæ</i>, <i>Araceæ</i>, <i>Cucurbitaceæ</i>. All persons who
wish success to the study of botany in England must rejoice to see it
tend to assume this idiomatic shape.] </p>

classification. It has appeared, in the survey which we have had to
give, that this science, no less than those which we first considered,
has been formed by a series of inductive processes, and has, in its
history, Epochs at which, by such processes, decided advances were
made. The important step in such cases is, the seizing upon some
artificial mark which conforms to natural resemblances;&#8212;some
basis of arrangement and nomenclature by means of which true
propositions of considerable generality can be enunciated. The advance
of other classificatory sciences, as well as botany, must consist of
such steps; and their course, like that of botany, must (if we attend
only to the real additions made to knowledge,) be gradual and
progressive, from the earliest times to the present.</p>
<p>To exemplify this continued and constant progression in the whole
range of Zoology, would require vast knowledge and great labor; and
is, perhaps, the less necessary, after we have dwelt so long on the
history of Botany, considered in the same point of view. But there are
a few observations respecting Zoology in general which we are led to
make in consequence of statements recently promulgated; for these
statements seem to represent the history of Zoology as having followed
a course very different from that which we have just ascribed to the
classificatory sciences in general. It is held by some naturalists,
that not only the formation of a systematic classification in Zoology
dates as far back as Aristotle; but that his classification is, in
many respects, superior to some of the most admired and recent
attempts of modern times.</p>
<p>If this were really the case, it would show that at least the idea
of a Systematic Classification had been formed and developed long
previous to the period to which we have assigned such a step; and it
would be difficult to reconcile such an early maturity of Zoology with
the conviction, which we have had impressed upon us by the other <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page413">413</a></span> parts of our history,
that not only labor but time, not only one man of genius but several,
and those succeeding each other, are requisite to the formation of any
considerable science.</p>
<p>But, in reality, the statements to which we refer, respecting the
scientific character of Aristotle’s Zoological system, are altogether
without foundation; and this science confirms the lessons taught us by
all the others. The misstatements respecting Aristotle’s doctrines are
on this account so important, and are so curious in themselves, that I
must dwell upon them a little.</p>
<p>Aristotle’s nine Books <i>On Animals</i> are a work enumerating the
differences of animals in almost all conceivable respects;&#8212;in
the organs of sense, of motion, of nutrition, the interior anatomy,
the exterior covering, the manner of life, growth, generation, and
many other circumstances. These differences are very philosophically
estimated. “The corresponding parts of animals,” he says,<a
id="fnanchor126-16" href="#note126-16"><span
class="fnanchor">126</span></a> “besides the differences of quality
and circumstance, differ in being more or fewer, greater or smaller,
and, speaking generally, in excess and defect. Thus some animals have
crustaceous coverings, others hard shells; some have long beaks, some
short; some have many wings, some have few; Some again have parts
which others want, as crests and spurs.” He then makes the following
important remark: “Some animals have parts which correspond to those
of others, not as being the same in species, nor by excess and defect,
but by <em>analogy</em>; thus a claw is analogous to a thorn, and a
nail to a hoof, and a hand to the nipper of a lobster, and a feather
to a scale; for what a feather is in a bird, that is a scale in a
fish.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note126-16"
href="#fnanchor126-16">126</a></span> Lib. i. c. i.</div>
<p>It will not, however, be necessary, in order to understand
Aristotle for our present purpose, that we should discuss his notion
of Analogy. He proceeds to state his object,<a id="fnanchor127-16"
href="#note127-16"><span class="fnanchor">127</span></a> which is, as
we have said, to describe the differences of animals in their
structure and habits. He then observes, that for structure, we may
take Man for our type,<a id="fnanchor128-16" href="#note128-16"><span
class="fnanchor">128</span></a> as being best known to us; and the
remainder of the first Book is occupied with a description of man’s
body, beginning from the head, and proceeding to the extremities.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note127-16"
href="#fnanchor127-16">127</a></span> Lib. i. c. ii.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note128-16"
href="#fnanchor128-16">128</a></span> c. iii.</div>
<p>In the next Book, (from which are taken the principal passages in
which his modern commentators detect his system,) he proceeds to
compare the differences of parts in different animals, according to
the order which he had observed in man. In the first chapter he speaks
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page414">414</a></span> of the head and
neck of animals; in the second, of the parts analogous to arms and
hands; in the third, of the breast and paps, and so on; and thus he
comes, in the seventh chapter, to the legs, feet, and toes: and in the
eleventh, to the teeth, and so to other parts.</p>
<p>The construction of a classification consists in the selection of
certain parts, as those which shall eminently and peculiarly determine
the place of each species in our arrangement. It is clear, therefore,
that such an enumeration of differences as we have described,
supposing it complete, contains the materials of all possible
classifications. But we can with no more propriety say that the author
of such an enumeration of differences is the author of any
classification which can be made by means of them, than we can say
that a man who writes down the whole alphabet writes down the solution
of a given riddle or the answer to a particular question.</p>
<p>Yet it is on no other ground than this enumeration, so far as I can
discover, that Aristotle’s “System” has been so decidedly spoken of,<a
id="fnanchor129-16" href="#note129-16"><span
class="fnanchor">129</span></a> and exhibited in the most formal
tabular shape. The authors of this <i>Systema Aristotelicum</i>, have
selected, I presume, the following passages from the work <i>On
Animals</i>, as they might have selected any other; and by arranging
them according to a subordination unknown to Aristotle himself have
made for him a scheme which undoubtedly bears a great resemblance to
the most complete systems of modern times.</p>

<p>Book I., chap. v.&#8212;“Some animals are viviparous, some
oviparous, some vermiparous. The viviparous are such as man, and the
horse, and all those animals which have hair; and of aquatic animals,
the whale kind, as the dolphin and cartilaginous fishes.”</p>
<p>Book II., chap. vii.&#8212;“Of quadrupeds which have blood and are
viviparous, some are (as to their extremities,) many-cloven, as the
hands and feet of man. For some are many-toed, as the lion, the dog,
the panther; some are bifid, and have hoofs instead of nails, as the
sheep, the goat, the elephant, the hippopotamus; and some have
undivided feet, as the solid-hoofed animals, the horse and ass. The
swine kind share both characters.”</p>
<p>Chap. ii.&#8212;“Animals have also great differences in the teeth,
both when compared with each other and with man. For all quadrupeds
which have blood and are viviparous, have teeth. And in the first
place, some are ambidental,<a id="fnanchor130-16"

in both jaws;) and some <span class="pagenum"><a

the upper jaw. Some have neither front teeth nor horns, as the camel;
some have tusks,<a id="fnanchor131-16" href="#note131-16"><span

serrated<a id="fnanchor132-16" href="#note132-16"><span

and the ox; for the animals which vary their cutting-teeth have all
serrated teeth. No animal has both tusks and horns; nor has any animal
with serrated teeth either of those weapons. The greater part have the
front teeth cutting, and those within broad.”</p>

<p>These passages undoubtedly contain most of the differences on which
the asserted Aristotelian classification rests; but the classification
is formed by using the characters drawn from the teeth, in order to
subdivide those taken from the feet; whereas in Aristotle these two
sets of characters stand side by side, along with dozens of others;
any selection of which, employed according to any arbitrary method of
subordination, might with equal justice be called Aristotle’s
system.</p>
<p>Why, for instance, in order to form subdivisions of animals, should
we not go on with Aristotle’s continuation of the second of the above
quoted passages, instead of capriciously leaping to the third? “Of
these some have horns, some have none . . . Some have a
fetlock-joint,<a id="fnanchor134-16" href="#note134-16"><span
class="fnanchor">134</span></a> some have none . . . Of those which
have horns, some have them solid throughout, as the stag; others, for
the most part, hollow . . . Some cast their horns, some do not.” If it
be replied, that we could not, by means of such characters, form a
tenable zoological system; we again ask by what right we assume
Aristotle to have made or attempted a systematic arrangement, when
what he has written, taken in its natural order, does not admit of
being construed into a system.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note134-16"
href="#fnanchor134-16">134</a></span> Ἀστράγαλον.</div>
<p>Again, what is the object of any classification? This, at least,
among others. To enable the person who uses it to study and describe
more conveniently the objects thus classified. If, therefore,
Aristotle had formed or adopted any system of arrangement, we should
see it in the order of the subjects in his work. Accordingly, so far
as he has a system, he professes to make this use of it. At the
beginning of the fifth Book, where he is proceeding to treat of the
different modes of generation of animals, he says, “As we formerly
made a Division of animals according to their kinds, we must now, in
the same manner, give a general survey of their History (θεωρίαν).
Except, indeed, that in the former case we made our commencement by a
description <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page416">416</a></span> of
man, but in the present instance we must speak of him last, because he
requires most study. We must begin then with those animals which have
shells; we must go on to those which have softer coverings, as
crustacea, soft animals, and insects; after these, fishes, both
viviparous and oviparous; then birds; then land animals, both
viviparous and oviparous.”</p>
<p>It is clear from this passage that Aristotle had certain wide and
indefinite views of classification, which though not very exact, are
still highly creditable to him; but it is equally clear that he was
quite unconscious of the classification that has been ascribed to him.
If he had adopted that or any other system, this was precisely the
place in which he must have referred to and employed it.</p>
<p>The honor due to the stupendous accumulation of zoological
knowledge which Aristotle’s works contain, cannot be tarnished by our
denying him the credit of a system which he never dreamt of and which,
from the nature of the progress of science, could not possibly be
constructed at that period. But, in reality, we may exchange the
mistaken claims which we have been contesting for a better, because a
truer praise. Aristotle does show, as far as could be done at his
time, a perception of the need of groups, and of names of groups, in
the study of the animal kingdom; and thus may justly be held up as the
great figure in the Prelude to the Formation of Systems which took
place in more advanced scientific times.</p>
<p>This appears, in some measure, from the passage last quoted. For
not only is there, in that, a clear recognition of the value and
object of a method in natural history; but the general arrangement of
the animal kingdom there proposed has considerable scientific merit,
and is, for the time, very philosophical. But there are passages in
his work in which he shows a wish to carry the principle of
arrangement more into detail. Thus, in the first Book, before
proceeding to his survey of the differences of animals,<a
id="fnanchor135-16" href="#note135-16"><span
class="fnanchor">135</span></a> after speaking of such classes as
Quadrupeds. Birds, Fishes, Cetaceous, Testaceous, Crustaceous Animals,
Mollusks, Insects, he says, (chap. vii.)</p>
<p class="eq">“Animals cannot be divided into large genera, in which
one kind includes many kinds. For some kinds are unique, and have no
difference of species, as <i>man</i>. Some have such kinds, but have
no names for them. Thus all quadrupeds which have not wings, have
blood. But of these, some are viviparous, some oviparous. Those which
are <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page417">417</a></span> viviparous
have not all hair; those which are oviparous have scales.” We have
here a manifestly intentional subordination of characters: and a kind
of regret that we have not names for the classes here indicated; such,
for instance, as viviparous quadrupeds having hair. But he follows the
subject into further detail. “Of the class of viviparous quadrupeds,”
he continues, “there are many genera,<a id="fnanchor136-16"
href="#note136-16"><span class="fnanchor">136</span></a> but these
again are without names, except specific names, such as <i>man</i>,
<i>lion</i>, <i>stag</i>, <i>horse</i>, <i>dog</i>, and the like. Yet
there is a genus of animals that have names, as the horse, the ass,
the <i>oreus</i>, the <i>ginnus</i>, the <i>innus</i>, and the animal
which in Syria is called <i>heminus</i> (mule); for these are called
<i>mules</i>, from their resemblance only; not being mules, for they
breed of their own kind. Wherefore,” he adds, that is, because we do
not possess recognized genera and generic names of this kind, “we must
take the species separately, and study the nature of each.”</p>

<p>These passages afford us sufficient ground for placing Aristotle at
the head of those naturalists to whom the first views of the necessity
of a zoological system are due. It was, however, very long before any
worthy successor appeared, for no additional step was made till modern
times. When Natural History again came to be studied in Nature, the
business of Classification, as we have seen, forced itself upon men’s
attention, and was pursued with interest in animals, as in plants. The
steps of its advance were similar in the two cases;&#8212;by
successive naturalists, various systems of artificial marks were
selected with a view to precision and convenience;&#8212;and these
artificial systems assumed the existence of certain natural groups,
and of a natural system to which they gradually tended. But there was
this difference between botany and zoology:&#8212;the reference to
physiological principles, which, as we have remarked, influenced the
natural systems of vegetables in a latent and obscure manner,
botanists being guided by its light, but hardly aware that they were
so, affected the study of systematic zoology more directly and
evidently. For men can neither overlook the general physiological
features of animals, nor avoid being swayed by them in their judgments
of the affinities of different species. Thus the classifications of
zoology tended more and more to a union with comparative anatomy, as
the science was more and more improved.<a id="fnanchor137-16"
href="#note137-16"><span class="fnanchor">137</span></a> But
comparative anatomy belongs to the subject of the next Book; and
anything it may be proper to say respecting its influence upon
zoological arrangements, will properly find a place there.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note137-16"
href="#fnanchor137-16">137</a></span> Cuvier, <i>Leç. d’Anat.
Comp.</i> vol. i. p. 17.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page418">418</a></span> It will
appear, and indeed it hardly requires to be proved, that those steps
in systematic zoology which are due to the light thrown upon the
subject by physiology, are the result of a long series of labors by
various naturalists, and have been, like other advances in science,
led to and produced by the general progress of such knowledge. We can
hardly expect that the classificatory sciences can undergo any
material improvement which is not of this kind. Very recently,
however, some authors have attempted to introduce into these sciences
certain principles which do not, at first sight, appear as a
continuation and extension of the previous researches of comparative
anatomists. I speak, in particular, of the doctrines of a <i>Circular
Progression</i> in the series of affinity; of a <i>Quinary
Division</i> of such circular groups; and of a relation of
<i>Analogy</i> between the members of such groups, entirely distinct
from the relation of <i>Affinity</i>.</p>
<p>The doctrine of Circular Progression has been propounded
principally by Mr. Macleay; although, as he has shown,<a
id="fnanchor138-16" href="#note138-16"><span
class="fnanchor">138</span></a> there are suggestions of the same kind
to be found in other writers. So far as this view negatives the
doctrine of a mere linear progression in nature, which would place
each genus in contact only with the preceding and succeeding ones, and
so far as it requires us to attend to more varied and ramified
resemblances, there can be no doubt that it is supported by the result
of all the attempts to form natural systems. But whether that
assemblage of circles of arrangement which is now offered to
naturalists, be the true and only way of exhibiting the natural
relations of organized bodies, is a much more difficult question, and
one which I shall not here attempt to examine; although it will be
found, I think, that those analogies of science which we have had to
study, would not fail to throw some light upon such an inquiry. The
prevalence of an invariable numerical law in the divisions of natural
groups, (as the number <i>five</i> is asserted to prevail by Mr.
Macleay, the number <i>ten</i> by Fries, and other numbers by other
writers), would be a curious fact, if established; but it is easy to
see that nothing short of the most consummate knowledge of natural
history, joined with extreme clearness of view and calmness of
judgment, could enable any one to pronounce on the attempts which have
been made to establish such a principle. But the doctrine of a
relation of <i>Analogy</i> distinct from Affinity, in the manner which
has recently been taught, seems to be obviously at variance with that
gradual approximation of the classificatory to the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page419">419</a></span> physiological
sciences, which has appeared to us to be the general tendency of real
knowledge. It seems difficult to understand how a reference to such
relations as those which are offered as examples of analogy<a
id="fnanchor139-16" href="#note139-16"><span
class="fnanchor">139</span></a> can be otherwise than a retrograde
step in science.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">The Progress of Ichthyology.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IF</span> it had been already
observed and admitted that sciences of the same kind follow, and must
follow, the same course in the order of their development, it would be
unnecessary to give a history of any special branch of Systematic
Zoology; since botany has already afforded us a sufficient example of
the progress of the classificatory sciences. But we may be excused for
introducing a sketch of the advance of one department of zoology,
since we are led to the attempt by the peculiar advantage we possess
in having a complete history of the subject written with great care,
and brought up to the present time, by a naturalist of unequalled
talents and knowledge. I speak of Cuvier’s <i>Historical View of
Ichthyology</i>, which forms the first chapter of his great work on
that part of natural history. The place and office in the progress of
this science, which is assigned to each person by Cuvier, will
probably not be lightly contested. It will, therefore, be no small
confirmation of the justice of the views on which the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page420">420</a></span> distribution of the
events in the history of botany was founded, if Cuvier’s
representation of the history of ichthyology offers to us obviously a
distribution almost identical.</p>
<p>We shall find that this is so;&#8212;that we have, in zoology as in
botany, a period of unsystematic knowledge; a period of misapplied
erudition; an epoch of the discovery of fixed characters; a period in
which many systems were put forward; a struggle of an artificial and a
natural method; and a gradual tendency of the natural method to a
manifestly physiological character. A few references to Cuvier’s
history will enable us to illustrate these and other analogies.</p>
<p><i>Period of Unsystematic Knowledge.</i>&#8212;It would be easy to
collect a number of the fabulous stories of early times, which formed
a portion of the imaginary knowledge of men concerning animals as well
as plants. But passing over these, we come to a long period and a
great collection of writers, who, in various ways, and with various
degrees of merit, contributed to augment the knowledge which existed
concerning fish, while as yet there was hardly ever any attempt at a
classification of that province of the animal kingdom. Among these
writers, Aristotle is by far the most important. Indeed he carried on
his zoological researches under advantages which rarely fall to the
lot of the naturalist; if it be true, as Athenæus and Pliny state,<a
id="fnanchor140-16" href="#note140-16"><span
class="fnanchor">140</span></a> that Alexander gave him sums which
amounted to nine hundred talents, to enable him to collect materials
for his history of animals, and put at his disposal several thousands
of men to be employed in hunting, fishing, and procuring information
for him. The works of his on Natural History which remain to us are,
nine Books <i>Of the History of Animals</i>; four, <i>On the Parts of
Animals</i>; five, <i>On the Generation of Animals</i>; one, <i>On the
Going of Animals</i>; one, <i>Of the Sensations, and the Organs of
them</i>; one, <i>On Sleeping and Waking</i>; one, <i>On the Motion of
Animals</i>; one, <i>On the Length and Shortness of Life</i>; one,
<i>On Youth and Old Age</i>; one, <i>On Life and Death</i>; one, <i>On
Respiration</i>. The knowledge of the external and internal
conformation of animals, their habits, instincts, and uses, which
Aristotle displays in these works, is spoken of as something wonderful
even to the naturalists of our own time. And he may be taken as a
sufficient representative of the whole of the period of which we
speak; for he is, says Cuvier,<a id="fnanchor141-16"
href="#note141-16"><span class="fnanchor">141</span></a> not only the
first, but the only one of the ancients who has treated of the natural
history of fishes (the province to which <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page421">421</a></span> we now confine ourselves,) in a
scientific point of view, and in a way which shows genius.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note140-16"

Poissons</i>, i. 13.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note141-16"
href="#fnanchor141-16">141</a></span> Cuv. p. 18.</div>
<p>We may pass over, therefore, the other ancient authors from whose
writings Cuvier, with great learning and sagacity, has levied
contributions to the history of ichthyology; as Theophrastus, Ovid,
Pliny, Oppian, Athenæus, Ælian, Ausonius, Galen. We may, too, leave
unnoticed the compilers of the middle ages, who did little but
abstract and disfigure the portions of natural history which they
found in the ancients. Ichthyological, like other knowledge, was
scarcely sought except in books, and on that very account was not
understood when it was found.</p>
<p><i>Period of Erudition.</i>&#8212;Better times at length came, and
men began to observe nature for themselves. The three great authors
who are held to be the founders of modern ichthyology, appeared in the
middle of the sixteenth century; these were Bélon, Rondelet, and
Salviani, who all published about 1555. All the three, very different
from the compilers who filled the interval from Aristotle to them,
themselves saw and examined the fishes which they describe, and have
given faithful representations of them. But, resembling in that
respect the founders of modern botany, Briassavola, Ruellius, Tragus,
and others, they resembled them in this also, that they attempted to
make their own observations a commentary upon the ancient writers.
Faithful to the spirit of their time, they are far more careful to
make out the names which each fish bore in the ancient world, and to
bring together scraps of their history from the authors in whom these
names occur, than to describe them in a lucid manner; so that without
their figures, says Cuvier, it would be almost as difficult to
discover their species as those of the ancients.</p>
<p>The difficulty of describing and naming species so that they can be
recognized, is little appreciated at first, although it is in reality
the main-spring of the progress of the sciences of classification.
Aristotle never dreamt that the nomenclature which was in use in his
time could ever become obscure;<a id="fnanchor142-16"
href="#note142-16"><span class="fnanchor">142</span></a> hence he has
taken no precaution to enable his readers to recognize the species of
which he speaks; and in him and in other ancient authors, it requires
much labor and great felicity of divination to determine what the
names mean. The perception of this difficulty among modern naturalists
led to systems, and to nomenclature founded upon system; but these did
not come into <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page422">422</a></span>
being immediately at the time of which we speak; nor till the evil had
grown to a more inconvenient magnitude.</p>

<p><i>Period of Accumulation of Materials. Exotic
Collections.</i>&#8212;The fishes of Europe were for some time the
principal objects of study; but those of distant regions soon came
into notice.<a id="fnanchor143-16" href="#note143-16"><span
class="fnanchor">143</span></a> In the seventeenth century the Dutch
conquered Brazil, and George Margrave, employed by them, described the
natural productions of the country, and especially the fishes.
Bontius, in like manner, described some of those of Batavia. Thus
these writers correspond to Romphius and Rheede in the history of
botany. Many others might be mentioned; but we must hasten to the
formation of systems, which is our main object of attention.</p>

<p><i>Epoch of the Fixation of Characters. Ray and
Willoughby.</i>&#8212;In botany, as we have seen, though Ray was one
of the first who invented a connected system, he was preceded at a
considerable interval by Cæsalpinus, who had given a genuine solution
of the same problem. It is not difficult to assign reasons why a sound
classification should be discovered for plants at an earlier period
than for fishes. The vastly greater number of the known species, and
the facilities which belong to the study of vegetables, give the
botanist a great advantage; and there are numerical relations of a
most definite kind (for instance, the number of parts of the
seed-vessel employed by Cæsalpinus as one of the bases of his system),
which are tolerably obvious in plants, but which are not easily
discovered in animals. And thus we find that in ichthyology, Ray, with
his pupil and friend Willoughby, appears as the first founder of a
tenable system.<a id="fnanchor144-16" href="#note144-16"><span
class="fnanchor">144</span></a></p>

<p>The first great division in this system is into
<i>cartilaginous</i> and <i>bony</i> fishes; a primary division, which
had been recognized by Aristotle, and is retained by Cuvier in his
latest labors. The subdivisions are determined by the general form of
the fish (as long or flat), by the teeth, the presence or absence of
ventral fins, the number of dorsal fins, and the nature of the spines
of the fins, as soft or prickly. Most of these characters have
preserved their importance in later systems; especially the last,
which, under the terms <i>malacopterygian</i> and
<i>acanthopterygian</i>, holds a place in the best recent
arrangements. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page423">423</a></span></p>
<p>That this system was a true first approximation to a solution of
the problem, appears to be allowed by naturalists. Although, says
Cuvier,<a id="fnanchor145-16" href="#note145-16"><span
class="fnanchor">145</span></a> there are in it no genera well defined
and well limited, still in many places the species are brought
together very naturally, and in such a way that a few words of
explanation would suffice to form, from the groups thus presented to
us, several of the genera which have since been received. Even in
botany, as we have seen, genera were hardly maintained with any degree
of precision, till the binary nomenclature of Linnæus made this
division a matter of such immense convenience.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note145-16"
href="#fnanchor145-16">145</a></span> Cuvier, p. 57.</div>
<p>The amount of this convenience, the value of a brief and sure
nomenclature, had not yet been duly estimated. The work of Willoughby
forms an epoch,<a id="fnanchor146-16" href="#note146-16"><span
class="fnanchor">146</span></a> and a happy epoch, in the history of
ichthyology; for the science, once systematized, could distinguish the
new from the old, arrange methodically, describe clearly. Yet, because
Willoughby had no nomenclature of his own, and no fixed names for his
genera, his immediate influence was not great. I will not attempt to
trace this influence in succeeding authors, but proceed to the next
important step in the progress of system.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note146-16"
href="#fnanchor146-16">146</a></span> p. 58.</div>
<p><i>Improvement of the System. Artedi.</i>&#8212;Peter Artedi was a
countryman and intimate friend of Linnæus; and rendered to ichthyology
nearly the same services which Linnæus rendered to botany. In his
<i>Philosophia Ichthyologica</i>, he analysed<a id="fnanchor147-16"
href="#note147-16"><span class="fnanchor">147</span></a> all the
interior and exterior parts of animals; he created a precise
terminology for the different forms of which these parts are
susceptible; he laid down rules for the nomenclature of genera and
species; besides his improvements of the subdivisions of the class. It
is impossible not to be struck with the close resemblance between
these steps, and those which are due to the <i>Fundamenta
Botanica</i>. The latter work appeared in 1736, the former was
published by Linnæus, after the death of the author, in 1738; but
Linnæus had already, as early as 1735, made use of Artedi’s
manuscripts in the ichthyological part of his <i>Systema Naturæ</i>.
We cannot doubt that the two young naturalists (they were nearly of
the same age), must have had a great influence upon each other’s views
and labors; and it would be difficult now to ascertain what portion of
the peculiar merits of the Linnæan reform was derived from Artedi. But
we may remark that, in ichthyology at least, Artedi appears to have
been a naturalist of more original views and profounder philosophy
than his friend and editor, who afterwards himself took up the
subject. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page424">424</a></span> The
reforms of Linnæus, in all parts of natural history, appear as if they
were mainly dictated by a love of elegance, symmetry, clearness, and
definiteness; but the improvement of the ichthyological system by
Artedi seems to have been a step in the progress to a natural
arrangement. His genera,<a id="fnanchor148-16"
href="#note148-16"><span class="fnanchor">148</span></a> which are
forty-five in number, are so well constituted, that they have almost
all been preserved; and the subdivisions which the
constantly-increasing number of species has compelled his successors
to introduce, have very rarely been such that they have led to the
transposition of his genera.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note147-16"
href="#fnanchor147-16">147</a></span> p. 20.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note148-16"
href="#fnanchor148-16">148</a></span> Cuvier, p. 71.</div>
<p>In its bases, however, Artedi’s was an artificial system. His
characters were positive and decisive, founded in general upon the
number of rays of the membrane of the gills, of which he was the first
to mark the importance;&#8212;upon the relative position of the fins,
upon their number, upon the part of the mouth where the teeth are
found, upon the conformation of the scales. Yet, in some cases, he has
recourse to the interior anatomy.</p>
<p>Linnæus himself at first did not venture to deviate from the
footsteps of a friend, who, in this science, had been his master. But
in 1758, in the tenth edition of the <i>Systema Naturæ</i>, he chose
to depend upon himself and devised a new ichthyological method. He
divided some genera, united others, gave to the species trivial names
and characteristic phrases, and added many species to those of Artedi.
Yet his innovations are for the most part disapproved of by Cuvier; as
his transferring the <i>chondropterygian</i> fishes of Artedi to the
class of reptiles, under the title of <i>Amphybia nantes</i>; and his
rejecting the distinction of acanthopterygian and malacopterygian,
which, as we have seen, had prevailed from the time of Willoughby, and
introducing in its stead a distribution founded on the presence or
absence of the ventral fins, and on their situation with regard to the
pectoral fins. “Nothing,” says Cuvier, “more breaks the true
connexions of genera than these orders of <i>apodes</i>,
<i>jugulares</i>, <i>thoracici</i>, and <i>abdominales</i>.”</p>
<p>Thus Linnæus, though acknowledging the value and importance of
natural orders, was not happy in his attempts to construct a system
which should lead to them. In his detection of good characters for an
artificial system he was more fortunate. He was always attentive to
number, as a character; and he had the very great merit<a
id="fnanchor149-16" href="#note149-16"><span
class="fnanchor">149</span></a> of introducing into the classification
the number of rays of the fins of each species. This mark is one of
great importance and use. And this, as well as <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page425">425</a></span> other branches of
natural history, derived incalculable advantages from the more general
merits of the illustrious Swede;<a id="fnanchor150-16"
href="#note150-16"><span class="fnanchor">150</span></a>&#8212;the
precision of the characters, the convenience of a well-settled
terminology, the facility afforded by the binary nomenclature. These
recommendations gave him a pre-eminence which was acknowledged by
almost all the naturalists of his time, and displayed by the almost
universal adoption of his nomenclature, in zoology, as well as in
botany; and by the almost exclusive employment of his distributions of
classes, however imperfect and artificial they might be.</p>

<p>And even<a id="fnanchor151-16" href="#note151-16"><span
class="fnanchor">151</span></a> if Linnæus had had no other merit than
the impulse he gave to the pursuit of natural science, this alone
would suffice to immortalize his name. In rendering natural history
easy, or at least in making it appear so, he diffused a general taste
for it. The great took it up with interest; the young, full of ardor,
rushed forwards in all directions, with the sole intention of
completing his system. The civilized world was eager to build the
edifice which Linnæus had planned.</p>

href="#fnanchor151-16">151</a></span> Ib. p. 88.</div>
<p>This spirit, among other results, produced voyages of natural
historical research, sent forth by nations and sovereigns. George the
Third of England had the honor of setting the example in this noble
career, by sending out the expeditions of Byron, Wallis, and Carteret,
in 1765. These were followed by those of Bougainville, Cook, Forster,
and others. Russia also scattered several scientific expeditions
through her vast dominions; and pupils of Linnæus sought the icy
shores of Greenland and Iceland, in order to apply his nomenclature to
the productions of those climes. But we need not attempt to convey any
idea of the vast stores of natural historical treasures which were
thus collected from every part of the globe.</p>
<p>I shall not endeavor to follow Cuvier in giving an account of the
great works of natural history to which this accumulation of materials
gave rise; such as the magnificent work of Bloch on Fishes, which
appeared in 1782&#8211;1785; nor need I attempt, by his assistance, to
characterize or place in their due position the several systems of
classification proposed about this time. But in the course of these
various essays, the distinction of the artificial and natural methods
of classification came more clearly into view than before; and this is
a point so important to the philosophy of the subject, that we must
devote a few words to it. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page426">426</a></span></p>
<p><i>Separation of the Artificial and Natural Methods in
Ichthyology.</i>&#8212;It has already been said that all so-called
<i>artificial methods</i> of classification must be natural, at least
as to the narrowest members of the system; thus the artificial Linnæan
method is natural as to species, and even as to genera. And on the
other hand, all proposed natural methods, so long as they remain
unmodified, are artificial as to their characteristic marks. Thus a
Natural Method is an attempt to provide positive and distinct
<em>characters</em> for the <em>wider</em> as well as for the narrower
<em>natural groups</em>. These considerations are applicable to
zoology as well as to botany. But the question, how we know natural
groups before we find marks for them, was, in botany, as we have seen,
susceptible only of vague and obscure answers:&#8212;the mind forms
them, it was said, by taking the aggregate of all the characters; or
by establishing a subordination of characters. And each of these
answers had its difficulty, of which the solution appeared to be, that
in attempting to form natural orders we are really guided by a latent
undeveloped estimate of physiological relations. Now this principle,
which was so dimly seen in the study of vegetables, shines out with
much greater clearness when we come to the study of animals, in which
the physiological relations of the parts are so manifest that they
cannot be overlooked, and have so strong an attraction for our
curiosity that we cannot help having our judgments influenced by them.
Hence the superiority of natural systems in zoology would probably be
far more generally allowed than in botany; and no arrangement of
animals which, in a large number of instances, violated strong and
clear natural affinities, would be tolerated because it answered the
purpose of enabling us easily to find the name and place of the animal
in the artificial system. Every system of zoological arrangement may
be supposed to aspire to be a natural system. But according to the
various habits of the minds of systematizers, this object was pursued
more or less steadily and successfully; and these differences came
more and more into view with the increase of knowledge and the
multiplication of attempts.</p>
<p>Bloch, whose ichthyological labors have been mentioned, followed in
his great work the method of Linnæus. But towards the end of his life
he had prepared a general system, founded upon one single numerical
principle;&#8212;the number of fins; just as the sexual system of
Linnæus is founded upon the number of stamina; and he made his
subdivisions according to the position of the ventral and pectoral
fins; the same character which Linnæus had employed for his primary
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page427">427</a></span> division. He
could not have done better, says Cuvier,<a id="fnanchor152-16"
href="#note152-16"><span class="fnanchor">152</span></a> if his object
had been to turn into ridicule all artificial methods, and to show to
what absurd combinations they may lead.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note152-16"
href="#fnanchor152-16">152</a></span> p. 108.</div>
<p>Cuvier himself who always pursued natural systems with a singularly
wise and sagacious consistency, attempted to improve the
ichthyological arrangements which had been proposed before him. In his
<i>Règne Animal</i>, published in 1817, he attempts the problem of
arranging this class; and the views suggested to him, both by his
successes and his failures, are so instructive and philosophical, that
I cannot illustrate the subject better than by citing some of
them.</p>
<p>“The class of fishes,” he says,<a id="fnanchor153-16"
href="#note153-16"><span class="fnanchor">153</span></a> “is, of all,
that which offers the greatest difficulties, when we wish to subdivide
it into orders, according to fixed and obvious characters. After many
trials, I have determined on the following distribution, which in some
instances is wanting in precision, but which possesses the advantage
of keeping the natural families entire.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note153-16"
href="#fnanchor153-16">153</a></span> <i>Règne Animal</i>, vol. ii. p.
110.</div>
<p>“Fish form two distinct series;&#8212;that of
<i>chondropterygians</i> or <i>cartilaginous fish</i>, and that of
<i>fish</i> properly so called.</p>
<p>“The <i>first</i> of these series has for its character, that the
palatine bones replace, in it, the bones of the upper jaw: moreover
the whole of its structure has evident analogies, which we shall
explain.</p>
<p>“It divides itself into three <span class="sc">orders</span>:</p>
<p>“The <span class="sc">Cyclostomes</span>, in which the jaws are
soldered (<i>soudées</i>) into an immovable ring, and the bronchiæ are
open in numerous holes.</p>
<p>“The <span class="sc">Selacians</span>, which have the bronchiæ
like the preceding, but not the jaws.</p>
<p>“The <span class="sc">Sturonians</span>, in which the bronchiæ are
open as usual by a slit furnished with an operculum.</p>
<p>“The second series, or that of <i>ordinary fishes</i>, offers me,
in the first place, a primary division, into those of which the
maxillary bone and the palatine arch are dovetailed (<i>engrenés</i>)
to the skull. Of these I make an order of <span
class="sc">Pectognaths</span>, divided into two families; the
<i>gymnodonts</i> and the <i>scleroderms</i>.</p>
<p>“After these I have the fishes with complete jaws, but with
bronchiæ which, instead of having the form of combs, as in all the
others, have the form of a series of little tufts (<i>houppes</i>). Of
these I again form an order, which I call <span
class="sc">Lophobranchs</span>, which only includes one family. <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page428">428</a></span></p>
<p>“There then remains an innumerable quantity of fishes, to which we
can no longer apply any characters except those of the exterior organs
of motion. After long examination, I have found that the least bad of
these characters is, after all, that employed by Ray and Artedi, taken
from the nature of the first rays of the dorsal and of the anal fin.
Thus ordinary fishes are divided into <span
class="sc">Malacopterygians</span>, of which all the rays are soft,
except sometimes the first of the dorsal fin or the
pectorals;&#8212;and <span class="sc">Acanthopterygians</span>, which
have always the first portion of the dorsal, or of the first dorsal
when there are two, supported by spinous rays, and in which the anal
has also some such rays, and the ventrals, at least, each one.</p>
<p>“The former may be subdivided without inconvenience, according to
their ventral fins, which are sometimes situate behind the abdomen,
sometimes adherent to the apparatus of the shoulder, or, finally, are
sometimes wanting altogether.</p>
<p>“We thus arrive at the three orders of <span class="sc">Abdominal
Malacopterygians</span>, of <span class="sc">Subbrachians</span>, and
of <span class="sc">Apodes</span>; each of which includes some natural
families which we shall explain: the first, especially, is very
numerous.</p>
<p>“But this basis of division is absolutely impracticable with the
Acanthopterygians; and the problem of establishing among these any
other subdivision than that of the natural families has hitherto
remained for me insoluble. Fortunately several of these families offer
characters almost as precise as those which we could give to true
orders.</p>
<p>“In truth, we cannot assign to the families of fishes, ranks as
marked, as for example, to those of mammifers. Thus the
Chondropterygians on the one hand hold to reptiles by the organs of
the senses, and by those of generation in some; and they are related
to mollusks and worms by the imperfection of the skeleton in
others.</p>
<p>“As to Ordinary Fishes, if any part of the organization is found
more developed in some than in others, there does not result from this
any pre-eminence sufficiently marked, or of sufficient influence upon
their whole system, to oblige us to consult it in the methodical
arrangement.</p>
<p>“We shall place them, therefore, nearly in the order in which we
have just explained their characters.”</p>
<p>I have extracted the whole of this passage, because, though it is
too technical to be understood in detail by the general reader, those
who have followed with any interest the history of the attempts at a
natural classification in any department in nature, will see here a
fine example of the problems which such attempts propose, of the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page429">429</a></span> difficulties which it
may present, and of the reasonings, labors, cautions, and varied
resources, by means of which its solution is sought, when a great
philosophical naturalist girds himself to the task. We see here, most
instructively, how different the endeavor to frame such a natural
system, is from the procedure of an artificial system, which carries
imperatively through the whole of a class of organized beings, a
system of marks either arbitrary, or conformable to natural affinities
in a partial degree. And we have not often the advantage of having the
reasons for a systematic arrangement so clearly and fully indicated,
as is done here, and in the descriptions of the separate orders.</p>
<p>This arrangement Cuvier adhered to in all its main points, both in
the second edition of the <i>Règne Animal</i>, published in 1821, and
in his <i>Histoire Naturelle des Poissons</i>, of which the first
volume was published in 1828, but which unfortunately was not
completed at the time of his death. It may be supposed, therefore, to
be in accordance with those views of zoological philosophy, which it
was the business of his life to form and to apply; and in a work like
the present, where, upon so large a question of natural history, we
must be directed in a great measure by the analogy of the history of
science, and by the judgments which seem most to have the character of
wisdom, we appear to be justified in taking Cuvier’s ichthyological
system as the nearest approach which has yet been made to a natural
method in that department.</p>
<p>The true natural method is only one: artificial methods, and even
good ones, there may be many, as we have seen in botany; and each of
these may have its advantages for some particular use. On some methods
of this kind, on which naturalists themselves have hardly yet had time
to form a stable and distinct opinion, it is not our office to decide.
But judging, as I have already said, from the general analogy of the
natural sciences, I find it difficult to conceive that the
ichthyological method of M. Agassiz, recently propounded with an
especial reference to fossil fishes, can be otherwise than an
artificial method. It is founded entirely on one part of the animal,
its scaly covering, and even on a single scale. It does not conform to
that which almost all systematic ichthyologists hitherto have
considered as a permanent natural distinction of a high order; the
distinction of bony and cartilaginous fishes; for it is stated that
each order contains examples of both.<a id="fnanchor154-16"
href="#note154-16"><span class="fnanchor">154</span></a> I do not know
what general anatomical or physiological <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page430">430</a></span> truths it brings into view; but they
ought to be very important and striking ones, to entitle them to
supersede those which led Cuvier to his system. To this I may add,
that the new ichthyological classification does not seem to form, as
we should expect that any great advance towards a natural system would
form, a connected sequel to the past history of ichthyology;&#8212;a
step to which anterior discoveries and improvements have led, and in
which they are retained.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note154-16"
href="#fnanchor154-16">154</a></span> Dr. Buckland’s <i>Bridgewater
Treatise</i>, p. 270.</div>
<p>But notwithstanding these considerations, the method of M. Agassiz
has probably very great advantages for his purpose; for in the case of
fossil fish, the parts which are the basis of his system often remain,
when even the skeleton is gone. And we may here again refer to a
principle of the classificatory sciences which we cannot make too
prominent;&#8212;all arrangements and nomenclatures are good, which
enable us to assert general propositions. Tried by this test, we
cannot fail to set a high value on the arrangement of M. Agassiz; for
propositions of the most striking generality respecting fossil remains
of fish, of which geologists before had never dreamt, are enunciated
by means of his groups and names. Thus only the two first orders, the
<i>Placoïdians</i> and <i>Ganoïdians</i>, existed before the
commencement of the cretaceous formation: the third and fourth orders,
the <i>Ctenoïdians</i> and <i>Cycloïdians</i>, which contain
three-fourths of the eight thousand known species of living Fishes,
appear for the first time in the cretaceous formation: and other
geological relations of these orders, no less remarkable, have been
ascertained by M. Agassiz.</p>
<p>But we have now, I trust, pursued these sciences of classification
sufficiently far; and it is time for us to enter upon that higher
domain of Physiology to which, as we have said. Zoology so
irresistibly directs us.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [I have retained the remarks which I ventured at first to
make on the System of M. Agassiz; but I believe the opinion of the
most philosophical ichthyologists to be that Cuvier’s System was too
exclusively based on the internal skeleton, as Agassiz’s was on the
external skeleton. In some degree both systems have been superseded,
while all that was true in each has been retained. Mr. Owen, in his
<i>Lectures on Vertebrata</i> (1846), takes Cuvierian characters from
the endo-skeleton, Agassizian ones from the exo-skeleton, Linnæan ones
from the ventral fins, Müllerian ones from the air-bladder, and
combines them by the light of his own researches, with the view of
forming a system more truly natural than any preceding one.</p>
<p>As I have said above, naturalists, in their progress towards a
Natural <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page431">431</a></span> System,
are guided by physiological relations, latently in Botany, but
conspicuously in Zoology. From the epoch of Cuvier’s <i>Règne
Animal</i>, the progress of Systematic Zoology is inseparably
dependent on the progress of Comparative Anatomy. Hence I have placed
Cuvier’s Classification of animal forms in the next Book, which treats
of Physiology.]</p>

<h3 class="space-above">INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<h4 class="five"><i>Of the Organical Sciences</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THOUGH</span> the general notion of
<em>life</em> is acknowledged by the most profound philosophers to be
dim and mysterious, even up to the present time; and must, in the
early stages of human speculation, have been still more obscure and
confused; it was sufficient, even then, to give interest and connexion
to men’s observations upon their own bodies and those of other
animals. It was seen, that in living things, certain peculiar
processes were constantly repeated, as those of breathing and of
taking food, for example; and that a certain conformation of the parts
of the animal was subservient to these processes; and thus were
gradually formed the notions of <i>Function</i> and of
<i>Organization</i>. And the sciences of which these notions formed
the basis are clearly distinguishable from all those which we have
hitherto considered. We conceive an <em>organized</em> body to be one
in which the parts are there for the sake of the whole, in a manner
different from any mechanical or chemical connexion; we conceive a
<i>function</i> to be not merely a process of change, but of change
connected with the general vital process. When mechanical or chemical
processes occur in the living body, they are instrumental to, and
directed by, the peculiar powers of life. The sciences which thus
consider organization and vital functions may be termed
<i>organical</i> sciences.</p>
<p>When men began to speculate concerning such subjects, the general
mode of apprehending the process in the cases of some functions,
appeared to be almost obvious; thus it was conceived that the growth
of animals arose from their frame appropriating to itself a part of
the substance of the food through the various passages of the body.
Under the influence of such general conceptions, speculative men were
naturally led to endeavor to obtain more clear and definite views of
the course of each of such processes, and of the mode in which the
separate parts contributed to it. Along with the observation of the
living person, the more searching examination which could be carried
on in the dead body, and the comparison of various kinds of animals,
soon showed that this pursuit was rich in knowledge and in interest.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page436">436</a></span> Moreover,
besides the interest which the mere speculative faculty gave to this
study, the Art of Healing added to it a great practical value; and the
effects of diseases and of medicines supplied new materials and new
motives for the reasonings of the philosopher.</p>
<p>In this manner anatomy or physiology may be considered as a science
which began to be cultivated in the earliest periods of civilization.
Like most other ancient sciences, its career has been one of perpetual
though variable progress; and as in others, so in this, each step has
implied those which had been previously made, and cannot be understood
aright except we understand them. Moreover, the steps of this advance
have been very many and diverse; the cultivators of anatomy have in
all ages been numerous and laborious; the subject is one of vast
extent and complexity; almost every generation had added something to
the current knowledge of its details; and the general speculations of
physiologists have been subtle, bold, and learned. It must, therefore,
be difficult or impossible for a person who has not studied the
science with professional diligence and professional advantages, to
form just judgments of the value of the discoveries of various ages
and persons, and to arrange them in their due relation to each other.
To this we may add, that though all the discoveries which have been
made with respect to particular functions or organizations are
understood to be subordinate to one general science, the Philosophy of
Life, yet the principles and doctrines of this science nowhere exist
in a shape generally received and assented to among physiologists; and
thus we have not, in this science, the advantage which in some others
we have possessed;&#8212;of discerning the true direction of its first
movements, by knowing the point to which they ultimately
tend;&#8212;of running on beyond the earlier discoveries, and thus
looking them in the face, and reading their true features. With these
disadvantages, all that we can have to say respecting the history of
Physiology must need great indulgence on the part of the reader.</p>
<p>Yet here, as in other cases, we may, by guiding our views by those
of the greatest and most philosophical men who have made the subject
their study, hope to avoid material errors. Nor can we well evade
making the attempt. To obtain some simple and consistent view of the
progress of physiological science, is in the highest degree important
to the completion of our views of the progress of physical science.
For the physiological or organical sciences form a class to which the
classes already treated of, the mechanical, chemical, and
classificatory sciences, are subordinate and auxiliary. Again, another
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page437">437</a></span> circumstance
which makes physiology an important part of our survey of human
knowledge is, that we have here a science which is concerned, indeed,
about material combinations, but in which we are led almost beyond the
borders of the material world, into the region of sensation and
perception, thought and will. Such a contemplation may offer some
suggestions which may prepare us for the transition from physical to
metaphysical speculations.</p>
<p>In the survey which we must, for such purposes, take of the
progress of physiology, it is by no means necessary that we should
exhaust the subject, and attempt to give the history of every branch
of the knowledge of the phenomena and laws of living creatures. It
will be sufficient, if we follow a few of the lines of such
researches, which may be considered as examples of the whole. We see
that life is accompanied and sustained by many processes, which at
first offer themselves to our notice as separate functions, however
they may afterwards be found to be connected and identified; such are
feeling, digestion, respiration, the action of the heart and pulse,
generation, perception, voluntary motion. The analysis of any one of
these functions may be pursued separately. And since in this, as in
all genuine sciences, our knowledge becomes real and scientific, only
in so far as it is verified in particular facts, and thus established
in general propositions, such an original separation of the subjects
of research is requisite to a true representation of the growth of
real knowledge. The loose hypotheses and systems, concerning the
connexion of different vital faculties and the general nature of
living things, which have often been promulgated, must be excluded
from this part of our plan. We do not deny all value and merit to such
speculations; but they cannot be admitted in the earlier stages of the
history of physiology, treated of as an inductive science. If the
doctrine so propounded have a solid and permanent truth, they will
again come before us when we have travelled through the range of more
limited truths, and are prepared to ascend with security and certainty
into the higher region of general physiological principles. If they
cannot be arrived at by such a road, they are then, however plausible
and pleasing, no portion of that real and progressive science with
which alone our history is concerned.</p>
<p>We proceed, therefore, to trace the establishment of some of the
more limited but certain doctrines of physiology. <span

<h3 class="space-above">CHAPTER I.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Discovery of the Organs of Voluntary
Motion.</span></h3>
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Knowledge of Galen and his
Predecessors.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IN</span> the earliest conceptions
which men entertained of their power of moving their own members, they
probably had no thought of any mechanism or organization by which this
was effected. The foot and the hand, no less than the head, were seen
to be endowed with life; and this pervading life seemed sufficiently
to explain the power of motion in each part of the frame, without its
being held necessary to seek out a special seat of the will, or
instruments by which its impulses were made effective. But the
slightest inspection of dissected animals showed that their limbs were
formed of a curious and complex collection of cordage, and
communications of various kinds, running along and connecting the
bones of the skeleton. These cords and communications we now
distinguish as muscles, nerves, veins, arteries, &amp;c.; and among
these, we assign to the muscles the office of moving the parts to
which they are attached, as cords move the parts of a machine. Though
this action of the muscles on the bones may now appear very obvious,
it was, probably, not at first discerned. It is observed that Homer,
who describes the wounds which are inflicted in his battles with so
much apparent anatomical precision, nowhere employs the word
<i>muscle</i>. And even Hippocrates of Cos, the most celebrated
physician of antiquity, is held to have had no distinct conception of
such an organ.<a id="fnanchor1-17" href="#note1-17"><span
class="fnanchor">1</span></a> He always employs the word <i>flesh</i>
when he means <i>muscle</i>, and the first explanation of the latter
word (μῦς) occurs in a spurious work ascribed to him. For nerves,
sinews, ligaments,<a id="fnanchor2-17" href="#note2-17"><span
class="fnanchor">2</span></a> he used indiscriminately the same terms;
(τόνος or νεῦρον;) and of these nerves (νεῦρα) he asserts that they
contract the limbs. Nor do we find much more distinctness on this
subject even in Aristotle, a generation or two later. “The origin of
the νεῦρα,” he says,<a id="fnanchor3-17" href="#note3-17"><span
class="fnanchor">3</span></a> “is from the heart; they connect <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page439">439</a></span> the bones, and
surround the joints.” It is clear that he means here the muscles, and
therefore it is with injustice that he has been accused of the gross
error of deriving the nerves from the heart. And he is held to have
really had the merit<a id="fnanchor4-17" href="#note4-17"><span
class="fnanchor">4</span></a> of discovering the nerves of sensation,
which he calls the “canals of the brain” (πόροι τοῦ ἐγκεφάλου); but
the analysis of the mechanism of motion is left by him almost
untouched. Perhaps his want of sound mechanical notions, and his
constant straining after verbal generalities, and systematic
classifications of the widest kind, supply the true account of his
thus missing the solution of one of the simplest problems of
Anatomy.</p>

<p>In this, however, as in other subjects, his immediate predecessors
were far from remedying the deficiencies of his doctrines. Those who
professed to study physiology and medicine were, for the most part,
studious only to frame some general system of abstract principles,
which might give an appearance of connexion and profundity to their
tenets. In this manner the successors of Hippocrates became a medical
school, of great note in its day, designated as the <i>Dogmatic</i>
school;<a id="fnanchor5-17" href="#note5-17"><span
class="fnanchor">5</span></a> in opposition to which arose an
<i>Empiric</i> sect, who professed to deduce their modes of cure, not
from theoretical dogmas, but from experience. These rival parties
prevailed principally in Asia Minor and Egypt, during the time of
Alexander’s successors,&#8212;a period rich in names, but poor in
discoveries; and we find no clear evidence of any decided advance in
anatomy, such as we are here attempting to trace.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note5-17"
href="#fnanchor5-17">5</a></span> Sprengel, <i>Gesch. Arz.</i> i.
583.</div>
<p>The victories of Lucullus and Pompeius, in Greece and Asia, made
the Romans acquainted with the Greek philosophy; and the consequence
soon was, that shoals of philosophers, rhetoricians, poets, and
physicians<a id="fnanchor6-17" href="#note6-17"><span
class="fnanchor">6</span></a> streamed from Greece, Asia Minor, and
Egypt, to Rome and Italy, to traffic their knowledge and their arts
for Roman wealth. Among these, was one person whose name makes a great
figure in the history of medicine, Asclepiades of Prusa in Bithynia.
This man appears to have been a quack, with the usual endowments of
his class;&#8212;boldness, singularity, a contemptuous rejection of
all previously esteemed opinions, a new classification of diseases, a
new list of medicines, and the assertion of some wonderful cures. He
would not, on such accounts, deserve a place in the history of
science, but that he became the founder of a new school, the
<i>Methodic</i>, which professed to hold itself separate both from the
Dogmatics and the Empirics.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note6-17"
href="#fnanchor6-17">6</a></span> Sprengel, <i>Gesch. Arz.</i> ii.
5.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page440">440</a></span> I have
noticed these schools of medicine, because, though I am not able to
state distinctly their respective merits in the cultivation of
anatomy, a great progress in that science was undoubtedly made during
their domination, of which the praise must, I conceive, be in some way
divided among them. The amount of this progress we are able to
estimate, when we come to the works of Galen, who flourished under the
Antonines, and died about <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 203. The
following passage from his works will show that this progress in
knowledge was not made without the usual condition of laborious and
careful experiment, while it implies the curious fact of such
experiment being conducted by means of family tradition and
instruction, so as to give rise to a <em>caste</em> of dissectors. In
the opening of his Second Book <i>On Anatomical Manipulations</i>, he
speaks thus of his predecessors: “I do not blame the ancients, who did
not write books on anatomical manipulation; though I praise Marinus,
who did. For it was superfluous for them to compose such records for
themselves or others, while they were, from their childhood, exercised
by their parents in dissecting, just as familiarly as in writing and
reading; so that there was no more fear of their forgetting their
anatomy, than of forgetting their alphabet. But when grown men, as
well as children, were taught, this thorough discipline fell off; and,
the art being carried out of the family of the Asclepiads, and
declining by repeated transmission, books became necessary for the
student.”</p>
<p>That the general structure of the animal frame, as composed of
bones and muscles, was known with great accuracy before the time of
Galen, is manifest from the nature of the mistakes and deficiencies of
his predecessors which he finds it necessary to notice. Thus he
observes, that some anatomists have made one muscle into two, from its
having two heads;&#8212;that they have overlooked some of the muscles
in the face of an ape, in consequence of not skinning the animal with
their own hands;&#8212;and the like. Such remarks imply that the
current knowledge of this kind was tolerably complete. Galen’s own
views of the general mechanical structure of an animal are very clear
and sound. The skeleton, he observes, discharges<a id="fnanchor7-17"
href="#note7-17"><span class="fnanchor">7</span></a> the office of the
pole of a tent, or the walls of a house. With respect to the action of
the muscles, his views were anatomically and mechanically correct; in
some instances, he showed what this action was, by severing the
muscle.<a id="fnanchor8-17" href="#note8-17"><span
class="fnanchor">8</span></a> He himself added considerably to the
existing knowledge of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page441">441</a></span> this subject; and his discoveries and
descriptions, even of very minute parts of the muscular system, are
spoken of with praise by modern anatomists.<a id="fnanchor9-17"
href="#note9-17"><span class="fnanchor">9</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note9-17"
href="#fnanchor9-17">9</a></span> Sprengel, ii. 150.</div>
<p>We may consider, therefore, that the doctrine of the muscular
system, as a collection of cords and sheets, by the contraction of
which the parts of the body are moved and supported, was firmly
established, and completely followed into detail, by Galen and his
predecessors. But there is another class of organs connected with
voluntary motion, the nerves, and we must for a moment trace the
opinions which prevailed respecting these. Aristotle, as we have said,
noticed some of the nerves of sensation. But Herophilus, who lived in
Egypt in the time of the first Ptolemy, distinguished nerves as the
organs of the will,<a id="fnanchor10-17" href="#note10-17"><span
class="fnanchor">10</span></a> and Rufus, who lived in the time of
Trajan,<a id="fnanchor11-17" href="#note11-17"><span
class="fnanchor">11</span></a> divides the nerves into sensitive and
motive, and derives them all from the brain. But this did not imply
that men had yet distinguished the nerves from the muscles. Even Galen
maintained that every muscle consists of a bundle of nerves and
sinews.<a id="fnanchor12-17" href="#note12-17"><span
class="fnanchor">12</span></a> But the important points, the necessity
of the nerve, and the origination of all this apparatus of motion from
the brain, he insists upon with great clearness and force. Thus he
proved the necessity experimentally, by cutting through some of the
bundles of nerves,<a id="fnanchor13-17" href="#note13-17"><span
class="fnanchor">13</span></a> and thus preventing the corresponding
motions. And it is, he says,<a id="fnanchor14-17"
href="#note14-17"><span class="fnanchor">14</span></a> allowed by all,
both physicians and philosophers, that where the origin of the nerve
is, there the seat of the soul (ἡγημονικὸν τῆς ψυχῆς) must be: now
this, he adds, is in the brain, and not in the heart.</p>

<p>Thus the general construction and arrangement of the organization
by which voluntary motion is effected, was well made out at the time
of Galen, and is found distinctly delivered in his works. We cannot,
perhaps, justly ascribe any large portion of the general discovery to
him: indeed, the conception of the mechanism of the skeleton and
muscles was probably so gradually unfolded in the minds of anatomical
students, that it would be difficult, even if we knew the labors of
each person, to select one, as peculiarly the author of the discovery.
But it is clear that all those who did materially contribute to the
establishment of this doctrine, must have possessed the qualifications
which we find in Galen for such a task; namely, clear mechanical views
of what the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page442">442</a></span>
tensions of collections of strings could do, and an exact practical
acquaintance with the muscular cordage which exists in the animal
frame;&#8212;in short, in this as in other instances of real advance
in science, there must have been clear ideas and real facts, unity of
thought and extent of observation, brought into contact.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Recognition of Final Causes in
Physiology. Galen.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">There</span> is one idea which the
researches of the physiologist and the anatomist so constantly force
upon him, that he cannot help assuming it as one of the guides of his
speculations; I mean, the idea of a <i>purpose</i>, or, as it is
called in Aristotelian phrase, a <i>final cause</i>, in the
arrangements of the animal frame. It is impossible to doubt that the
motive nerves run along the limbs, <em>in order that</em> they may
convey to the muscles the impulses of the will; and that the muscles
are attached to the bones, <em>in order that</em> they may move and
support them. This conviction prevails so steadily among anatomists,
that even when the use of any part is altogether unknown, it is still
taken for granted that it has some use. The developement of this
conviction,&#8212;of a purpose in the parts of animals,&#8212;of a
function to which each portion of the organization is
subservient,&#8212;contributed greatly to the progress of physiology;
for it constantly urged men forwards in their researches respecting
each organ, till some definite view of its purpose was obtained. The
assumption of hypothetical final causes in Physics may have been, as
Bacon asserts it to have been, prejudicial to science; but the
assumption of unknown final causes in Physiology, has given rise to
the science. The two branches of speculation, Physics and Physiology,
were equally led, by every new phenomenon, to ask their question,
“Why?” But, in the former case, “why” meant “through what cause?” in
the latter, “for what end?” And though it may be possible to introduce
into physiology the doctrine of efficient causes, such a step can
never obliterate the obligations which the science owes to the
pervading conception of a purpose contained in all organization.</p>
<p>This conception makes its appearance very early. Indeed, without
any special study of our structure, the thought, that we are fearfully
and wonderfully made, forces itself upon men, with a mysterious
impressiveness, as a suggestion of our Maker. In this bearing, the
thought is developed to a considerable extent in the well-known
passage in Xenophon’s <i>Conversations of Socrates</i>. Nor did it
ever lose its hold on sober-minded and instructed men. The Epicureans,
indeed, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page443">443</a></span> held
that the eye was not made for seeing, nor the ear for hearing; and
Asclepiades, whom we have already mentioned as an impudent pretender,
adopted this wild dogma.<a id="fnanchor15-17" href="#note15-17"><span
class="fnanchor">15</span></a> Such assertions required no labor. “It
is easy,” says Galen,<a id="fnanchor16-17" href="#note16-17"><span
class="fnanchor">16</span></a> “for people like Asclepiades, when they
come to any difficulty, to say that Nature has worked to no purpose.”
The great anatomist himself pursues his subject in a very different
temper. In a well-known passage, he breaks out into an enthusiastic
scorn of the folly of the atheistical notions.<a id="fnanchor17-17"
href="#note17-17"><span class="fnanchor">17</span></a> “Try,” he says,
“if you can imagine a shoe made with half the skill which appears in
the skin of the foot.” Some one had spoken of a structure of the human
body which he would have preferred to that which it now has. “See,”
Galen exclaims, after pointing out the absurdity of the imaginary
scheme, “see what brutishness there is in this wish. But if I were to
spend more words on such cattle, reasonable men might blame me for
desecrating my work, which I regard as a religious hymn in honor of
the Creator.”</p>

<p>Galen was from the first highly esteemed as an anatomist. He was
originally of Pergamus; and after receiving the instructions of many
medical and philosophical professors, and especially of those of
Alexandria, which was then the metropolis of the learned and
scientific world, he came to Rome, where his reputation was soon so
great as to excite the envy and hatred of the Roman physicians. The
emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus would have retained him near
them; but he preferred pursuing his travels, directed principally by
curiosity. When he died, he left behind him numerous works, all of
them of great value for the light they throw on the history of anatomy
and medicine; and these were for a long period the storehouse of all
the most important anatomical knowledge which the world possessed. In
the time of intellectual barrenness and servility, among the Arabians
and the Europeans of the dark ages, the writings of Galen had almost
unquestioned authority;<a id="fnanchor18-17" href="#note18-17"><span
class="fnanchor">18</span></a> and it was only by an uncommon effort
of independent thinking that Abdollatif ventured to assert, that even
Galen’s assertions must give way to the evidence of the senses. In
more modern times, when Vesalius, in the sixteenth century, accused
Galen of mistakes, he drew upon himself the hostility of the whole
body of physicians. Yet the mistakes were such as might have <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page444">444</a></span> been pointed out and
confessed<a id="fnanchor19-17" href="#note19-17"><span
class="fnanchor">19</span></a> without acrimony, if, in times of
revolution, mildness and moderation were possible; but an impatience
of the superstition of tradition on the part of the innovators, and an
alarm of the subversion of all recognized truths on the part of the
established teachers, inflame and pervert all such discussions.
Vesalius’s main charge against Galen is, that his dissections were
performed upon animals, and not upon the human body. Galen himself
speaks of the dissection of apes as a very familiar employment, and
states that he killed them by drowning. The natural difficulties
which, in various ages, have prevented the unlimited prosecution of
human dissection, operated strongly among the ancients, and it would
have been difficult, under such circumstances, to proceed more
judiciously than Galen did.</p>

<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Prelude to the
Discovery.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> blood-vessels, the veins
and arteries, are as evident and peculiar in their appearance as the
muscles; but their function is by no means so obvious. Hippocrates<a
id="fnanchor20-17" href="#note20-17"><span
class="fnanchor">20</span></a> did not discriminate Veins and
Arteries; both are called by the same name (φλέβες) and the word from
which artery comes (ἀρτηρίη) means, in his works, the windpipe.
Aristotle, scanty as was his knowledge of the vessels of the body, has
yet the merit of having traced the origin of all the veins to the
heart. He expressly contradicts those of his predecessors who had
derived the veins from the head;<a id="fnanchor21-17"
href="#note21-17"><span class="fnanchor">21</span></a> and refers to
dissection for the proof. If the book <i>On the Breath</i> be genuine
(which is doubted), Aristotle was aware of the distinction between
veins and arteries. “Every artery,” <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page445">445</a></span> it is there asserted, “is accompanied by
a vein; the former are filled only with breath or air.”<a
id="fnanchor22-17" href="#note22-17"><span
class="fnanchor">22</span></a> But whether or no this passage be
Aristotle’s, he held opinions equally erroneous; as, that the windpipe
conveys air into the heart.<a id="fnanchor23-17"
href="#note23-17"><span class="fnanchor">23</span></a> Galen<a
id="fnanchor24-17" href="#note24-17"><span
class="fnanchor">24</span></a> was far from having views respecting
the blood-vessels, as sound as those which he entertained concerning
the muscles. He held the liver to be the origin of the veins, and the
heart of the arteries. He was, however, acquainted with their
junctions, or <i>anastomoses</i>. But we find no material advance in
the knowledge of this subject, till we overleap the blank of the
middle ages, and reach the dawn of modern science.</p>

<p>The father of modern anatomy is held to be Mondino,<a
id="fnanchor25-17" href="#note25-17"><span
class="fnanchor">25</span></a> who dissected and taught at Bologna in
1315. Some writers have traced in him the rudiments of the doctrine of
the circulation of the blood; for he says that the heart transmits
blood to the lungs. But it is allowed, that he afterwards destroys the
merit of his remark, by repeating the old assertion that the left
ventricle ought to contain spirit or air, which it generates from the
blood.</p>

Anatomy.</div>
<p>Anatomy was cultivated with great diligence and talent in Italy by
Achillini, Carpa, and Messa, and in France by Sylvius and Stephanus
(Dubois and Etienne). Yet still these empty assumptions respecting the
heart and blood-vessels kept their ground. Vesalius, a native of
Brussels, has been termed the founder of human anatomy, and his great
work <i>De Humani Corporis Fabricâ</i> is, even yet, a splendid
monument of art, as well as science. It is said that his figures were
designed by Titian; and if this be not exactly true, says Cuvier,<a
id="fnanchor26-17" href="#note26-17"><span
class="fnanchor">26</span></a> they must, at least, be from the pencil
of one of the most distinguished pupils of the great painter; for to
this day, though we have more finished drawings, we have no designs
that are more artist-like. Fallopius, who succeeded Vesalius at Padua,
made some additions to the researches of his predecessor; but in his
treatise <i>De Principio Venarum</i>, it is clearly seen<a
id="fnanchor27-17" href="#note27-17"><span
class="fnanchor">27</span></a> that the circulation of the blood was
unknown to him. Eustachius also, whom Cuvier groups with Vesalius and
Fallopius, as the three great founders of modern anatomy, wrote a
treatise on the vein <i>azygos</i><a id="fnanchor28-17"
href="#note28-17"><span class="fnanchor">28</span></a> which is a
little treatise on comparative anatomy; but the discovery of the
functions of the veins came from a different quarter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page446">446</a></span> The
unfortunate Servetus, who was burnt at Geneva as a heretic in 1553, is
the first person who speaks distinctly of the small circulation, or
that which carries the blood from the heart to the lungs, and back
again to the heart. His work entitled <i>Christianismi Restitutio</i>
was also burnt; and only two copies are known to have escaped the
flames. It is in this work that he asserts the doctrine in question,
as a collateral argument or illustration of his subject. “The
communication between the right and left ventricle of the heart, is
made,” he says, “not as is commonly believed, through the partition of
the heart, but by a remarkable artifice (<i>magno artificio</i>) the
blood is carried from the right ventricle by a long circuit through
the lungs; is elaborated by the lungs, made yellow, and transfused
from the <i>vena arteriosa</i> into the <i>arteria venosa</i>.” This
truth is, however, mixed with various of the traditional fancies
concerning the “<i>vital spirit</i>, which has its origin in the left
ventricle.” It may be doubted, also, how far Servetus formed his
opinion upon conjecture, and on a hypothetical view of the formation
of this vital spirit. And we may, perhaps, more justly ascribe the
real establishment of the pulmonary circulation as an inductive truth,
to Realdus Columbus, a pupil and successor of Vesalius at Padua, who
published a work <i>De Re Anatomicâ</i> in 1559, in which he claims
this discovery as his own.<a id="fnanchor29-17"

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note29-17"

<p>Andrew Cæsalpinus, who has <a href="#v2page373">already</a> come under our notice as one of
the fathers of modern inductive science, both by his metaphysical and
his physical speculations, described the pulmonary circulation still
more completely in his <i>Quæstiones Peripateticæ</i>, and even seemed
to be on the eve of discovering the great circulation; for he remarked
the swelling of veins below ligatures, and inferred from it a refluent
motion of blood in these vessels.<a id="fnanchor30-17"
href="#note30-17"><span class="fnanchor">30</span></a> But another
discovery of structure was needed, to prepare the way for this
discovery of function; and this was made by Fabricius of
Acquapendente, who succeeded in the grand list of great professors at
Padua, and taught there for fifty years.<a id="fnanchor31-17"
href="#note31-17"><span class="fnanchor">31</span></a> Sylvius had
discovered the existence of the valves of the veins; but Fabricius
remarked that they are all turned towards the heart. Combining this
disposition with that of the valves of the heart, and with the absence
of valves in the arteries, he might have come to the conclusion<a
id="fnanchor32-17" href="#note32-17"><span
class="fnanchor">32</span></a> that the blood moves in a different
direction in the arteries and in the veins, and might thus have
discovered the circulation: but this glory was reserved for William
Harvey: so true <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page447">447</a></span>
is it, observes Cuvier, that we are often on the brink of a discovery
without suspecting that we are so;&#8212;so true is it, we may add,
that a certain succession of time and of persons is generally
necessary to familiarize men with one thought, before they can advance
to that which is the next in order.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>The Discovery of the Circulation made by
Harvey.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">William Harvey</span> was born in
1578, at Folkestone in Kent.<a id="fnanchor33-17"
href="#note33-17"><span class="fnanchor">33</span></a> He first
studied at Cambridge: he afterwards went to Padua, where the celebrity
of Fabricius of Acquapendente attracted from all parts those who
wished to be instructed in anatomy and physiology. In this city,
excited by the discovery of the valves of the veins, which his master
had recently made, and reflecting on the direction of the valves which
are at the entrance of the veins into the heart, and at the exit of
the arteries from it, he conceived the idea of making experiments, in
order to determine what is the course of the blood in its vessels. He
found that when he tied up veins in various animals, they swelled
below the ligature, or in the part furthest from the heart; while
arteries, with a like ligature, swelled on the side next the heart.
Combining these facts with the direction of the valves, he came to the
conclusion that the blood is impelled, by the left side of the heart,
in the arteries to the extremities, and thence returns by the veins
into the right side of the heart. He showed, too, how this was
confirmed by the phenomena of the pulse, and by the results of opening
the vessels. He proved, also, that the circulation of the lungs is a
continuation of the larger circulation; and thus the whole doctrine of
the double circulation was established.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note33-17"
href="#fnanchor33-17">33</a></span> Cuv. p. 51.</div>
<p>Harvey’s experiments had been made in 1616 and 1618; it is commonly
said that he first promulgated his opinion in 1619; but the manuscript
of the lectures, delivered by him as lecturer to the College of
Physicians, is extant in the British Museum, and, containing the
propositions on which the doctrine is founded, refers them to April,
1616. It was not till 1628 that he published, at Frankfort, his
<i>Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis</i>; but he there
observes that he had for above nine years confirmed and illustrated
his opinion in his lectures, by arguments grounded upon ocular
demonstrations. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page448">448</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Reception of the Discovery.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Without</span> dwelling long upon
the circumstances of the general reception of this doctrine, we may
observe that it was, for the most part, readily accepted by his
countrymen, but that abroad it had to encounter considerable
opposition. Although, as we have seen, his predecessors had approached
so near to the discovery, men’s minds were by no means as yet prepared
to receive it. Several physicians denied the truth of the opinion,
among whom the most eminent was Riolan, professor at the Collège de
France. Other writers, as usually happens in the case of great
discoveries, asserted that the doctrine was ancient, and even that it
was known to Hippocrates. Harvey defended his opinion with spirit and
temper; yet he appears to have retained a lively recollection of the
disagreeable nature of the struggles in which he was thus involved. At
a later period of his life, Ent,<a id="fnanchor34-17"
href="#note34-17"><span class="fnanchor">34</span></a> one of his
admirers, who visited him, and urged him to publish the researches on
generation, on which he had long been engaged, gives this account of
the manner in which he received the proposal: “And would you then
advise me, (smilingly replies the doctor,) to quit the tranquillity of
this haven, wherein I now calmly spend my days, and again commit
myself to the unfaithful ocean? You are not ignorant how great
troubles my lucubrations, formerly published, have raised. Better it
is, certainly, at some time, to endeavor to grow wise at home in
private, than by the hasty divulgation of such things to the knowledge
whereof you have attained with vast labor, to stir up tempests that
may deprive you of your leisure and quiet for the future.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note34-17"
href="#fnanchor34-17">34</a></span> Epist. Dedic. to <i>Anatom.
Exercit.</i></div>
<p>His merits were, however, soon generally recognized. He was<a
id="fnanchor35-17" href="#note35-17"><span
class="fnanchor">35</span></a> made physician to James the First, and
afterwards to Charles the First, and attended that unfortunate monarch
in the civil war. He had the permission of the parliament to accompany
the king on his leaving London; but this did not protect him from
having his house plundered in his absence, not only of its furniture,
but, which he felt more, of the records of his experiments. In 1652,
his brethren of the College of Physicians placed a marble bust of him
in their hall, with an inscription recording his discoveries; and two
years later, he was nominated to the office of President of the
College, which however he <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page449">449</a></span> declined in consequence of his age and
infirmities. His doctrine soon acquired popular currency; it was, for
instance, taken by Descartes<a id="fnanchor36-17"
href="#note36-17"><span class="fnanchor">36</span></a> as the basis of
his physiology in his work <i>On Man</i>; and Harvey had the pleasure,
which is often denied to discoverers, of seeing his discovery
generally adopted during his lifetime.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 4.&#8212;<i>Bearing of the Discovery on the Progress
of Physiology.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">In</span> considering the
intellectual processes by which Harvey’s discoveries were made, it is
impossible not to notice, that the recognition of a creative purpose,
which, as we have said, appears in all sound physiological reasonings,
prevails eminently here. “I remember,” says Boyle, “that when I asked
our famous Harvey what were the things that induced him to think of a
circulation of the blood, he answered me, that when he took notice
that the valves in the veins of so many parts of the body were so
placed, that they gave a free passage to the blood towards the heart,
but opposed the passage of the venal blood the contrary way; he was
incited to imagine that so provident a cause as Nature had not placed
so many valves without design; and no design seemed more probable than
that the blood should be sent through the arteries, and return through
the veins, whose valves did not oppose its course that way.”</p>
<p>We may notice further, that this discovery implied the usual
conditions, distinct general notions, careful observation of many
facts, and the mental act of bringing together these elements of
truth. Harvey must have possessed clear views of the motions and
pressures of a fluid circulating in ramifying tubes, to enable him to
see how the position of valves, the pulsation of the heart, the
effects of ligatures, of bleeding, and of other circumstances, ought
to manifest themselves in order to confirm his view. That he referred
to a multiplied and varied experience for the evidence that it was so
confirmed, we have already said. Like all the best philosophers of his
time, he insists rigidly upon the necessity of such experience. “In
every science,” he says,<a id="fnanchor37-17" href="#note37-17"><span
class="fnanchor">37</span></a> “be it what it will, a diligent
observation is requisite, and sense itself must be frequently
consulted. We must not rely upon other men’s experience, but our own,
without which no man is a proper disciple of any part of natural
knowledge.” And by publishing his experiments, he trusts, he adds,
that he has enabled his reader “to be an equitable <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page450">450</a></span> umpire between
Aristotle and Galen;” or rather, he might have said, to see how, in
the promotion of science, sense and reason, observation and invention,
have a mutual need of each other.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note37-17"
href="#fnanchor37-17">37</a></span> <i>Generation of Animals</i>,
Pref.</div>
<p>We may observe further, that though Harvey’s glory, in the case now
before us, rested upon his having proved the reality of certain
mechanical movements and actions in the blood, this discovery, and all
other physiological truths, necessarily involved the assumption of
some peculiar agency belonging to living things, different both from
mechanical agency, and from chemical; and in short, something
<em>vital</em>, and not physical merely. For when it was seen that the
pulsation of the heart, its <i>systole</i> and <i>diastole</i>, caused
the circulation of the blood, it might still be asked, what force
caused this constantly-recurring contraction and expansion. And again,
circulation is closely connected with respiration; the blood is, by
the circulation, carried to the lungs, and is there, according to the
expression of Columbus and Harvey, mixed with air. But by what
mechanism does this <i>mixture</i> take place, and what is the real
nature of it? And when succeeding researches had enabled physiologists
to give an answer to this question, as far as chemical relations go,
and to say, that the change consists in the abstraction of the carbon
from the blood by means of the oxygen of the atmosphere; they were
still only led to ask further, how this chemical change was effected,
and how such a change of the blood fitted it for its uses. Every
function of which we explain the course, the mechanism, or the
chemistry, is connected with other functions,&#8212;is subservient to
them, and they to it; and all together are parts of the general vital
system of the animal, ministering to its life, but deriving their
activity from the life. Life is not a collection of forces, or
polarities, or affinities, such as any of the physical or chemical
sciences contemplate; it has powers of its own, which often supersede
those subordinate relations; and in the cases where men have traced
such agents in the animal frame, they have always seen, and usually
acknowledged, that these agents were ministerial to some higher
agency, more difficult to trace than these, but more truly the cause
of the phenomena.</p>
<p>The discovery of the mechanical and chemical conditions of the
vital functions, as a step in physiology, may be compared to the
discovery of the laws of phenomena in the heavens by Kepler and his
predecessors, while the discovery of the force by which they were
produced was still reserved in mystery for Newton to bring to light.
The subordinate relation of the facts, their <span class="correction"
title="emended from dependance">dependence</span> on space and time,
their reduction to order and cycle, had been fully performed; but the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page451">451</a></span> reference of
them to distinct ideas of causation, their interpretation as the
results of mechanical force, was omitted or attempted in vain. The
very notion of such Force, and of the manner in which motions were
determined by it, was in the highest degree vague and vacillating; and
a century was requisite, as we have seen, to give to the notion that
clearness and fixity which made the Mechanics of the Heavens a
possible science. In like manner, the notion of Life, and of Vital
Forces, is still too obscure to be steadily held. We cannot connect it
distinctly with severe inductions from facts. We can trace the motions
of the animal fluids as Kepler traced the motions of the planets; but
when we seek to render a reason for these motions, like him, we recur
to terms of a wide and profound, but mysterious import; to Virtues,
Influences, undefined Powers. Yet we are not on this account to
despair. The very instance to which I am referring shows us how rich
is the promise of the future. Why, says Cuvier,<a id="fnanchor38-17"
href="#note38-17"><span class="fnanchor">38</span></a> may not Natural
History one day have its Newton? The idea of the vital forces may
gradually become so clear and definite as to be available in science;
and future generations may include, in their physiology, propositions
elevated as far above the circulation of the blood, as the doctrine of
universal gravitation goes beyond the explanation of the heavenly
motions by epicycles.</p>

<p>If, by what has been said, I have exemplified sufficiently the
nature of those steps in physiology, which, like the discovery of the
Circulation, give an explanation of the process of some of the animal
functions, it is not necessary for me to dwell longer on the subject;
for to write a history, or even a sketch of the history of Physiology,
would suit neither my powers nor my purpose. Some further analysis of
the general views which have been promulgated by the most eminent
physiologists, may perhaps be attempted in treating of the Philosophy
of Inductive Science; but the estimation of the value of recent
speculations and investigations must be left to those who have made
this vast subject the study of their lives. A few brief notices may,
however, be here introduced. <span class="pagenum"><a

<h3 class="space-above">CHAPTER III.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Discovery of the Motion of the Chyle, and consequent
Speculations.</span></h3>
<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>The Discovery of the Motion
of the Chyle.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IT</span> may have been observed in
the previous course of this History of the Sciences, that the
discoveries in each science have a peculiar physiognomy: something of
a common type may be traced in the progress of each of the theories
belonging to the same department of knowledge. We may notice something
of this common form in the various branches of physiological
speculation. In most, or all of them, we have, as we have noticed the
case to be with respect to the circulation of the blood, clear and
certain discoveries of mechanical and chemical processes, succeeded by
speculations far more obscure, doubtful, and vague, respecting the
relation of these changes to the laws of life. This feature in the
history of physiology may be further instanced, (it shall be done very
briefly), in one or two other cases. And we may observe, that the
lesson which we are to collect from this narrative, is by no means
that we are to confine ourselves to the positive discovery, and reject
all the less clear and certain speculations. To do this, would be to
lose most of the chances of ulterior progress; for though it may be,
that our conceptions of the nature of organic life are not yet
sufficiently precise and steady to become the guides to positive
inductive truths, still the only way in which these peculiar
physiological ideas can be made more distinct and precise, and thus
brought more nearly into a scientific form, is by this struggle with
our ignorance or imperfect knowledge. This is the lesson we have
learnt from the history of physical astronomy and other sciences. We
must strive to refer facts which are known and understood, to higher
principles, of which we cannot doubt the existence, and of which, in
some degree, we can see the place; however dim and shadowy may be the
glimpses we have hitherto been able to obtain of their forms. We may
often fail in such attempts, but without the attempt we can never
succeed. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page453">453</a></span></p>
<p>That the food is received into the stomach, there undergoes a
change of its consistence, and is then propelled along the intestines,
are obvious facts in the animal economy. But a discovery made in the
course of the seventeenth century brought into clearer light the
sequel of this series of processes, and its connexion with other
functions. In the year 1622, Asellius or Aselli<a id="fnanchor39-17"
href="#note39-17"><span class="fnanchor">39</span></a> discovered
certain minute vessels, termed <i>lacteals</i>, which absorb a white
liquid (the <i>chyle</i>) from the bowels, and pour it into the blood.
These vessels had, in fact, been discovered by Eristratus, in the
ancient world,<a id="fnanchor40-17" href="#note40-17"><span
class="fnanchor">40</span></a> in the time of Ptolemy; but Aselli was
the first modern who attended to them. He described them in a treatise
entitled <i>De Venis Lacteis, cum figuris elegantissimis</i>, printed
at Milan in 1627, the year after the death of the author. The work is
remarkable as the first which exhibits <em>colored</em> anatomical
figures; the arteries and veins are represented in red, the lacteals
in black.</p>

<p>Eustachius,<a id="fnanchor41-17" href="#note41-17"><span
class="fnanchor">41</span></a> at an earlier period, had described (in
the horse) the thoracic duct by which the chyle is poured into the
subclavian vein, on the right side of the neck. But this description
did not excite so much notice as to prevent its being forgotten, and
rediscovered in 1550, after the knowledge of the circulation of the
blood had given more importance to such a discovery. Up to this
time,<a id="fnanchor42-17" href="#note42-17"><span
class="fnanchor">42</span></a> it had been supposed that the lacteals
carried the chyle to the liver, and that the blood was manufactured
there. This opinion had prevailed in all the works of the ancients and
moderns; its falsity was discovered by Pecquet, a French physician,
and published in 1651, in his <i>New Anatomical Experiments</i>; in
which are discovered a receptacle of the chyle, unknown till then, and
the vessel which conveys it to the subclavian vein. Pecquet himself
and other anatomists, soon connected this discovery with the doctrine,
then recently promulgated, of the circulation of the blood. In 1665,
these vessels, and the <i>lymphatics</i> which are connected with
them, were further illustrated by Ruysch in his exhibition of their
valves. (<i>Dilucidatio valvularum in vasis lymphaticis et

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Thus</span> it was shown that
aliments taken into the stomach are, by its action, made to produce
<i>chyme</i>; from the chyme, gradually changed <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page454">454</a></span> in its progress
through the intestines, <i>chyle</i> is absorbed by the lacteals; and
this, poured into the blood by the thoracic duct, repairs the waste
and nourishes the growth of the animal. But by what powers is the food
made to undergo these transformations? Can we explain them on
mechanical or on chemical principles? Here we come to a part of
physiology less certain than the discovery of vessels, or of the
motion of fluids. We have a number of opinions on this subject, but no
universally acknowledged truth. We have a collection of <i>Hypotheses
of Digestion</i> and <i>Nutrition</i>.</p>
<p>I shall confine myself to the former class; and without dwelling
long upon these, I shall mention some of them. The philosophers of the
Academy <i>del Cimento</i>, and several others, having experimented on
the stomach of gallinaceous birds, and observed the astonishing force
with which it breaks and grinds substances, were led to consider the
digestion which takes place in the stomach as a kind of
<i>trituration</i>.<a id="fnanchor43-17" href="#note43-17"><span
class="fnanchor">43</span></a> Other writers thought it was more
properly described as <i>fermentation</i>; others again spoke of it as
a <i>putrefaction</i>. Varignon gave a merely physical account of the
first part of the process, maintaining that the division of the
aliments was the effect of the disengagement of the air introduced
into the stomach, and dilated by the heat of the body. The opinion
that digestion is a <i>solution</i> of the food by the gastric juice
has been more extensively entertained.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note43-17"
href="#fnanchor43-17">43</a></span> Bourdon, <i>Physiol. Comp.</i> p.
514.</div>
<p>Spallanzani and others made many experiments on this subject. Yet
it is denied by the best physiologists, that the changes of digestion
can be adequately represented as chemical changes only. The nerves of
the stomach (the <i>pneumo-gastric</i>) are said to be essential to
digestion. Dr. Wilson Philip has asserted that the influence of these
nerves, when they are destroyed, may be replaced by a galvanic
current.<a id="fnanchor44-17" href="#note44-17"><span
class="fnanchor">44</span></a> This might give rise to a supposition
that digestion depends on galvanism. Yet we cannot doubt that all
these hypotheses,&#8212;mechanical, physical, chemical,
galvanic&#8212;are altogether insufficient. “The stomach must have,”
as Dr. Prout says,<a id="fnanchor45-17" href="#note45-17"><span
class="fnanchor">45</span></a> “the power of <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page455">455</a></span> organizing and vitalizing the different
elementary substances. It is impossible to imagine that this
organizing agency of the stomach can be chemical. This agency is
<em>vital</em>, and its nature completely unknown.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note44-17"
href="#fnanchor44-17">44</a></span> Müller (<i>Manual of
Physiology</i>, B. iii. Sect. 1, Chap. iii.) speaks of Dr. Wilson
Philip’s assertion that the nerves of the stomach being cut, and a
galvanic current kept up in them, digestion is still accomplished. He
states that he and other physiologists have repeated such experiments
on an extensive scale, and have found no effect of this kind.</div>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Examination of the Process of Reproduction in Animals
and Plants, and Consequent Speculations.</span></h3>
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>The Examination of the
Process of Reproduction in Animals.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IT</span> would not, perhaps, be
necessary to give any more examples of what has hitherto been the
general process of investigations on each branch of physiology; or to
illustrate further the combination which such researches present, of
certain with uncertain knowledge;&#8212;of solid discoveries of organs
and processes, succeeded by indefinite and doubtful speculation
concerning vital forces. But the reproduction of organized beings is
not only a subject of so much interest as to require some notice, but
also offers to us laws and principles which include both the vegetable
and the animal kingdom; and which, therefore, are requisite to render
intelligible the most general views to which we can attain, respecting
the world of organization.</p>
<p>The facts and laws of reproduction were first studied in detail in
animals. The subject appears to have attracted the attention of some
of the philosophers of antiquity in an extraordinary degree: and
indeed we may easily imagine that they hoped, by following this path,
if any, to solve the mystery of creation. Aristotle appears to have
pursued it with peculiar complacency; and his great work <i>On
animals</i> contains<a id="fnanchor46-17" href="#note46-17"><span
class="fnanchor">46</span></a> an extraordinary collection of curious
observations relative to this subject. He had learnt the modes of
reproduction of most of the animals with which he was acquainted; and
his work is still, as a writer of our own times has said,<a
id="fnanchor47-17" href="#note47-17"><span
class="fnanchor">47</span></a> “original after so many copies, and
young after two thousand years.” His observations referred principally
to the external circumstances of generation: the anatomical
examination was <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page456">456</a></span>
left to his successors. Without dwelling on the intermediate labors,
we come to modern times, and find that this examination owes its
greatest advance to those who had the greatest share in the discovery
of the circulation of the blood;&#8212;Fabricius of Acquapendente, and
Harvey. The former<a id="fnanchor48-17" href="#note48-17"><span
class="fnanchor">48</span></a> published a valuable work on the Egg
and the Chick. In this are given, for the first time, figures
representing the developement of the chick, from its almost
imperceptible beginning, to the moment when it breaks the shell.
Harvey pursued the researches of his teacher. Charles<a
id="fnanchor49-17" href="#note49-17"><span
class="fnanchor">49</span></a> the First had supplied him with the
means of making the experiments which his purpose required, by
sacrificing a great number of the deer in Windsor Park in the state of
gestation: but his principal researches were those respecting the egg,
in which he followed out the views of Fabricius. In the troubles which
succeeded the death of the unfortunate Charles the house of Harvey was
pillaged; and he lost the whole of the labors he had bestowed on the
generation of insects. His work, <i>Exercitationes de Generatione
Animalium</i>, was published at London in 1651; it is more detailed
and perfect than that of Fabricius; but the author was prevented by
the unsettled condition of the country from getting figures engraved
to accompany his descriptions.</p>

<p>Many succeeding anatomists pursued the examination of the series of
changes in generation, and of the organs which are concerned in them,
especially Malpighi, who employed the microscope in this
investigation, and whose work on the Chick was published in 1673. It
is impossible to give here any general view of the result of these
laborious series of researches: but we may observe, that they led to
an extremely minute and exact survey of all the parts of the fœtus,
its envelopes and appendages, and, of course, to a designation of
these by appropriate names. These names afterwards served to mark the
attempts which were made to carry the analogy of animal generation
into the vegetable kingdom.</p>
<p>There is one generalization of Harvey which deserves notice.<a
id="fnanchor50-17" href="#note50-17"><span
class="fnanchor">50</span></a> He was led by his researches to the
conclusion, that all living things may be properly said to come from
eggs: “Omne vivum ex ovo.” Thus not only do oviparous animals produce
by means of eggs, but in those which are viviparous, the process of
generation begins with the developement of a small vesicle, which
comes from the ovary, and which exists before the embryo: and thus
viviparous or suckling-beasts, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page457">457</a></span> notwithstanding their name, are born
from eggs, as well as birds, fishes, and reptiles.<a
id="fnanchor51-17" href="#note51-17"><span
class="fnanchor">51</span></a> This principle also excludes that
supposed production of organized beings without parents (of worms in
corrupted matter, for instance,) which was formerly called
<i>spontaneous generation</i>; and the best physiologists of modern
times agree in denying the reality of such a mode of generation.<a

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>The Examination of the Process of
Reproduction in Vegetables.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> extension of the
analogies of animal generation to the vegetable world was far from
obvious. This extension was however made;&#8212;with reference to the
embryo plant, principally by the microscopic observers, Nehemiah Grew,
Marcello Malpighi, and Antony Leeuwenhoek;&#8212;with respect to the
existence of the sexes, by Linnæus and his predecessors.</p>
<p>The microscopic labors of Grew and Malpighi were patronized by the
Royal Society of London in its earliest youth. Grew’s book, <i>The
Anatomy of Plants</i>, was ordered to be printed in 1670. It contains
plates representing extremely well the process of germination in
various seeds, and the author’s observations exhibit a very clear
conception of the relation and analogies of different portions of the
seed. On the day on which the copy of this work was laid before the
Society, a communication from Malpighi of Bologna, <i>Anatomes
Plantarum Idea</i>, stated his researches, and promised figures which
should illustrate them. Both authors afterwards went on with a long
train of valuable observations, which they published at various times,
and which contain much that has since become a permanent portion of
the science.</p>
<p>Both Grew and Malpighi were, as we have remarked, led to apply to
vegetable generation many terms which imply an analogy with the
generation of animals. Thus, Grew terms the innermost coat of the
seed, the <i>secundine</i>; speaks of the <i>navel-fibres</i>, &amp;c.
Many more such terms have been added by other writers. And, as has
been observed by a modern physiologist,<a id="fnanchor53-17"
href="#note53-17"><span class="fnanchor">53</span></a> the resemblance
is striking. Both in the vegetable seed and in the fertilized animal
egg, we have an <i>embryo</i>, <i>chalazæ</i>, a <i>placenta</i>, an
<i>umbilical cord</i>, a <i>cicatricula</i>, an <i>amnios</i>,
<i>membranes</i>, <i>nourishing vessels</i>. The <i>cotyledons</i> of
the seed are the equivalent of the <i>vitellus</i> of birds, or of the
<i>umbilical vesicle</i> of <span class="correction" title="emended
from sucking-beasts">suckling-beasts</span>: <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page458">458</a></span> the <i>albumen</i> or <i>perisperm</i>
of the grain is analogous to the <i>white of the egg</i> of birds, or
the <i>allantoid</i> of viviparous animals.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note53-17"
href="#fnanchor53-17">53</a></span> Ib. p. 384.</div>
<p><i>Sexes of Plants.</i>&#8212;The attribution of sexes to plants,
is a notion which was very early adopted; but only gradually unfolded
into distinctness and generality.<a id="fnanchor54-17"
href="#note54-17"><span class="fnanchor">54</span></a> The ancients
were acquainted with the fecundation of vegetables. Empedocles,
Aristotle, Theophrastus, Pliny, and some of the poets, make mention of
it; but their notions were very incomplete, and the conception was
again lost in the general shipwreck of human knowledge. A Latin poem,
composed in the fifteenth century by Jovianus Pontanus, the preceptor
of Alphonso, King of Naples, is the first modern work in which mention
is made of the sex of plants. Pontanus sings the loves of two
date-palms, which grew at the distance of fifteen leagues from each
other: the male at Brundusium, the female at Otranto. The distance did
not prevent the female from becoming fruitful, as soon as the palms
had raised their heads above the surrounding trees, so that nothing
intervened directly between them, or, to speak with the poet, so that
they were able to see each other.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note54-17"
href="#fnanchor54-17">54</a></span> Mirbel, <i>El.</i> ii. 538.</div>
<p>Zaluzian, a botanist who lived at the end of the fifteenth century,
says that the greater part of the species of plants are
<i>androgynes</i>, that is, have the properties of the male and of the
female united in the same plant; but that some species have the two
sexes in separate individuals; and he adduces a passage of Pliny
relative to the fecundation of the date-palm. John Bauhin, in the
middle of the seventeenth century, cites the expressions of Zaluzian;
and forty years later, a professor of Tübingen, Rudolph Jacob
Camerarius, pointed out clearly the organs of generation, and proved
by experiments on the mulberry, on maize, and on the plant called
Mercury (<i>mercurialis</i>), that when by any means the action of the
stamina upon the pistils is intercepted, the seeds are barren.
Camerarius, therefore, a philosopher in other respects of little note,
has the honor assigned him of being the author of the discovery of the
sexes of plants in modern times.<a id="fnanchor55-17"
href="#note55-17"><span class="fnanchor">55</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note55-17"
href="#fnanchor55-17">55</a></span> Mirbel, ii. 539.</div>
<p>The merit of this discovery will, perhaps, appear more considerable
when it is recollected that it was rejected at first by very eminent
botanists. Thus Tournefort, misled by insufficient experiments,
maintained that the stamina are excretory organs; and Reaumur, at the
beginning of the eighteenth century, inclined to the same doctrine.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page459">459</a></span> Upon this,
Geoffroy, an apothecary at Paris, scrutinized afresh the sexual
organs; he examined the various forms of the pollen, already observed
by Grew and Malpighi; he pointed out the excretory canal, which
descends through the style, and the <i>micropyle</i>, or minute
orifice in the coats of the ovule, which is opposite to the extremity
of this canal; though he committed some mistakes with regard to the
nature of the pollen. Soon afterwards, Sebastian Vaillant, the pupil
of Tournefort, but the corrector of his error on this subject,
explained in his public lectures the phenomenon of the fecundation of
plants, described the explosion of the anthers, and showed that the
<i>florets</i> of composite flowers, though formed on the type of an
<i>androgynous</i> flower, are sometimes male, sometimes female, and
sometimes neuter.</p>
<p>But though the sexes of plants had thus been noticed, the subject
drew far more attention when Linnæus made the sexual parts the basis
of his classification. Camerarius and Burkard had already entertained
such a thought, but it was Linnæus who carried into effect, and thus
made the notion of the sexes of vegetables almost as familiar to us as
that of the sexes of animals.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>The Consequent
Speculations.&#8212;Hypotheses of Generation.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> views of the processes of
generation, and of their analogies throughout the whole of the organic
world, which were thus established and diffused, form an important and
substantial part of our physiological knowledge. That a number of
curious but doubtful hypotheses should be put forward, for the purpose
of giving further significance and connexion to these discoveries, was
to be expected. We must content ourselves with speaking of these very
briefly. We have such hypotheses in the earliest antiquity of Greece;
for as we have already said, the speculations of cosmogony were the
source of the Greek philosophy; and the laws of generation appeared to
offer the best promise of knowledge respecting the mystery of
creation. Hippocrates explained the production of a new animal by the
<i>mixture of seed</i> of the parents; and the offspring was male or
female as the seminal principle of the father or of the mother was the
more powerful. According to Aristotle, the mother supplied the
<i>matter</i>, and the father the <i>form</i>. Harvey’s doctrine was,
that the ovary of the female is fertilized by a <i>seminal
contagion</i> produced by the seed of the male. But an opinion which
obtained far more general reception was, that <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page460">460</a></span> the <i>embryo pre-existed</i> in the
mother, before any union of the sexes.<a id="fnanchor56-17"
href="#note56-17"><span class="fnanchor">56</span></a> It is easy to
see that this doctrine is accompanied with great difficulties;<a
id="fnanchor57-17" href="#note57-17"><span
class="fnanchor">57</span></a> for if the mother, at the beginning of
life, contain in her the embryos of all her future children; these
embryos again must contain the children which they are capable of
producing; and so on indefinitely; and thus each female of each
species contains in herself the germs of infinite future generations.
The perplexity which is involved in this notion of an endless series
of creatures, thus encased one within another, has naturally driven
inquirers to attempt other suppositions. The microscopic researches of
Leeuwenhoek and others led them to the belief that there are certain
animalcules contained in the seed of the male, which are the main
agents in the work of reproduction. This system ascribes almost
everything to the male, as the one last mentioned does to the female.
Finally, we have the system of Buffon;&#8212;the famous hypothesis of
<i>organic molecules</i>. That philosopher asserted that he found, by
the aid of the microscope, all nature full of moving globules, which
he conceived to be, not animals as Leeuwenhoek imagined, but bodies
capable of producing, by their combination, either animals or
vegetables, in short, all organized bodies. These globules he called
<i>organic molecules</i>.<a id="fnanchor58-17" href="#note58-17"><span
class="fnanchor">58</span></a> And if we inquire how these organic
molecules, proceeding from all parts of the two parents, unite into a
whole, as perfect as either of the progenitors, Buffon answers, that
this is the effect of the <i>interior mould</i>; that is, of a system
of internal laws and tendencies which determine the form of the result
as an external mould determines the shape of the cast.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note56-17"
href="#fnanchor56-17">56</a></span> Bourdon, p. 204.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note57-17"

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note58-17"
href="#fnanchor58-17">58</a></span> Ib. p. 219.</div>
<p>An admirer of Buffon, who has well shown the untenable character of
this system, has urged, as a kind of apology for the promulgation of
the hypothesis,<a id="fnanchor59-17" href="#note59-17"><span
class="fnanchor">59</span></a> that at the period when its author
wrote, he could not present his facts with any hope of being attended
to, if he did not connect them by some common tie, some dominant idea
which might gratify the mind; and that, acting under this necessity,
he did well to substitute for the extant theories, already
superannuated and confessedly imperfect, conjectures more original and
more probable. Without dissenting from this view, we may observe, that
Buffon’s theory, like those which preceded it, is excusable, and even
deserving of admiration, so far as it groups the facts consistently;
because in doing this, it exhibits the necessity, which the
physiological speculator ought to feel, of aspiring to definite and
solid general principles; and that thus, though <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page461">461</a></span> the theory may not be
established as true, it may be useful by bringing into view the real
nature and application of such principles.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note59-17"
href="#fnanchor59-17">59</a></span> Ib. p. 221.</div>
<p>It is, therefore, according to our views, unphilosophical to derive
despair, instead of hope, from the imperfect success of Buffon and his
predecessors. Yet this is what is done by the writer to whom we refer.
“For me,” says he,<a id="fnanchor60-17" href="#note60-17"><span
class="fnanchor">60</span></a> “I vow that, after having long
meditated on the system of Buffon,&#8212;a system so remarkable, so
ingenious, so well matured, so wonderfully connected in all its parts,
at first sight so probable;&#8212;I confess that, after this long
study, and the researches which it requires, I have conceived in
consequence, a distrust of myself a skepticism, a disdain of
hypothetical systems, a decided predilection and exclusive taste for
pure and rational observation, in short, a disheartening, which I had
never felt before.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note60-17"
href="#fnanchor60-17">60</a></span> Bourdon, p. 274.</div>
<p>The best remedy of such feelings is to be found in the history of
science. Kepler, when he had been driven to reject the solid epicycles
of the ancients, or a person who had admired Kepler as M. Bourdon
admires Buffon, but who saw that his magnetic virtue was an untenable
fiction, might, in the same manner, have thrown up all hope of a sound
theory of the causes of the celestial motions. But astronomers were
too wise and too fortunate to yield to such despondency. The
predecessors of Newton substituted a solid science of Mechanics for
the vague notions of Kepler; and the time soon came when Newton
himself reduced the motions of the heavens to a Law as distinctly
conceived as the Motions had been before.</p>

<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>The Examination of the
Nervous System.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IT</span> is hardly necessary to
illustrate by further examples the manner in which anatomical
observation has produced conjectural and hypothetical attempts to
connect structure and action with some <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page462">462</a></span> higher principle, of a more peculiarly
physiological kind. But it may still be instructive to notice a case
in which the principle, which is thus brought into view, is far more
completely elevated above the domain of matter and mechanism than in
those we have yet considered;&#8212;a case where we have not only
Irritation, but Sensation;&#8212;not only Life, but Consciousness and
Will. A part of science in which suggestions present themselves,
brings us, in a very striking manner, to the passage from the physical
to the hyperphysical sciences.</p>
<p>We have seen already (<a href="#v2page438">chap. i</a>.) that Galen
and his predecessors had satisfied themselves that the nerves are the
channels of perception; a doctrine which had been distinctly taught by
Herophilus<a id="fnanchor61-17" href="#note61-17"><span
class="fnanchor">61</span></a> in the Alexandrian school. Herophilus,
however, still combined, under the common name of Nerves, the Tendons;
though he distinguished such Nerves from those which arise from the
brain and the spinal marrow, and which are subservient to the will. In
Galen’s time this subject had been prosecuted more into detail. That
anatomist has left a Treatise expressly upon <i>The Anatomy of the
Nerves</i>; in which he describes the successive <i>Pairs</i> of
Nerves: thus, the First Pair are the visual nerves: and we see, in the
language which Galen uses, the evidence of the care and interest with
which he had himself examined them. “These nerves,” he says, “are not
resolved into many fibres, like all the other nerves, when they reach
the organs to which they belong; but spread out in a different and
very remarkable manner, which it is not easy to describe or to
believe, without actually seeing it.” He then gives a description of
the retina. In like manner he describes the Second Pair, which is
distributed to the muscles of the eyes; the Third and Fourth Pairs,
which go to the tongue and palate; and so on to the Seventh Pair. This
division into Seven Pairs was established by Marinus,<a
id="fnanchor62-17" href="#note62-17"><span
class="fnanchor">62</span></a> but Vesalius found it to be incomplete.
The examination which is the basis of the anatomical enumeration of
the Nerves at present recognized was that of Willis. His book,
entitled <i>Cerebri Anatome, cui accessit Nervorum descriptio et
usus</i>, appeared at London in 1664. He made important additions to
the knowledge of this subject.<a id="fnanchor63-17"
href="#note63-17"><span class="fnanchor">63</span></a> Thus he is the
first who describes in a distinct manner what has been called the
<i>Nervous Centre</i>,<a id="fnanchor64-17" href="#note64-17"><span
class="fnanchor">64</span></a> the pyramidal eminences which,
according to more recent anatomists, are the communication of the
brain with the spinal marrow: and of which the <i>Decussation</i>,
described by Santorini, affords the explanation of the action of a
part <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page463">463</a></span> of the
brain upon the nerves of the opposite side. Willis proved also that
the <i>Rete Mirabile</i>, the remarkable net-work of arteries at the
base of the brain, observed by the ancients in ruminating animals,
does not exist in man. He described the different Pairs of Nerves with
more care than his predecessors; and his mode of numbering them is
employed up to the present time. He calls the Olfactory Nerves the
First Pair; previously to him, these were not reckoned a Pair: and
thus the optic nerves were, as we have seen, called the first. He
added the Sixth and the Ninth Pairs, which the anatomists who preceded
him did not reckon. Willis also examined carefully the different
<i>Ganglions</i>, or knots which occur upon the nerves. He traced them
wherever they were to be found, and he gave a general figure of what
Cuvier calls the <i>nervous skeleton</i>, very superior to that of
Vesalius, which was coarse and inexact. Willis also made various
efforts to show the connexion of the parts of the brain. In the
earlier periods of anatomy, the brain had been examined by slicing it,
so as to obtain a section. Varolius endeavored to unravel it, and was
followed by Willis. Vicq d’Azyr, in modern times, has carried the
method of section to greater perfection than had before been given
it;<a id="fnanchor65-17" href="#note65-17"><span
class="fnanchor">65</span></a> as Vieussens and Gall have done with
respect to the method of Varolius and Willis. Recently Professor
Chaussier<a id="fnanchor66-17" href="#note66-17"><span
class="fnanchor">66</span></a> makes three kinds of Nerves:&#8212;the
<i>Encephalic</i>, which proceed from the head, and are twelve on each
side;&#8212;the <i>Rachidian</i>, which proceed from the spinal
marrow, and are thirty on each side;&#8212;and <i>Compound Nerves</i>,
among which is the <i>Great Sympathetic</i> Nerve.</p>

<p>One of the most important steps ever made in our knowledge of the
nerves is, the distinction which Bichat is supposed to have
established, of a <i>ganglionic system</i>, and a <i>cerebral
system</i>. And we may add, to the discoveries in nervous anatomy, the
remarkable one, made in our own time, that the two offices&#8212;of
conducting the motive impressions from the central seat of the will to
the muscles, and of propagating sensations from the surface of the
body and the external organs of sense to the sentient
mind&#8212;reside in two distinct portions of the nervous
substance:&#8212;a discovery which has been declared<a
id="fnanchor67-17" href="#note67-17"><span
class="fnanchor">67</span></a> to be “doubtless the most important
accession to physiological (anatomical) knowledge since the time of
Harvey.” This doctrine was first published and taught by Sir Charles
Bell: after an interval of some <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page464">464</a></span> years, it was more distinctly delivered
in the publications of Mr. John Shaw, Sir C. Bell’s pupil. Soon
afterwards it was further confirmed, and some part of the evidence
corrected, by Mr. Mayo, another pupil of Sir C. Bell, and by M.
Majendie.<a id="fnanchor68-17" href="#note68-17"><span

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note68-17"
href="#fnanchor68-17">68</a></span> As authority for the expressions
which I have now used in the text, I will mention Müller’s <i>Manual
of Physiology</i> (4th edition, 1844). In Book iii. Section 2, Chap.
i., “On the Nerves of Sensation and Motion,” Müller says, “Charles
Bell was the first who had the ingenious thought that the posterior
roots of the nerves of the spine&#8212;those which are furnished with
a ganglion&#8212;govern sensation only; that the anterior roots are
appointed for motion; and that the primitive fibres of these roots,
after being united in a single nervous cord, are mingled together in
order to supply the wants of the skin and muscles. He developed this
idea in a little work (<i>An Idea of a new Anatomy of the Brain</i>,
London, 1811), which was not intended to travel beyond the circle of
his friends.” Müller goes on to say, that eleven years later, Majendie
prosecuted the same theory. But Mr. Alexander Shaw, in 1839, published
<i>A Narrative of the Discoveries of Sir Charles Bell in the Nervous
System</i>, in which it appears that Sir Charles Bell had further
expounded his views in his lectures to his pupils (p. 89), and that
one of these, Mr. John Shaw, had in various publications, in 1821 and
1822, further insisted upon the same views; especially in a Memoir
<i>On Partial Paralysis</i> (p. 75). MM. Mayo and Majendie both
published Memoirs in August, 1822; and these and subsequent works
confirmed the doctrine of Bell. Mr. Alexander Shaw states (p. 97),
that a mistake of Sir Charles Bell’s, in an experiment which he had
made to prove his doctrine, was discovered through the joint labors of
M. Majendie and Mr. Mayo.</div>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>The Consequent Speculations. Hypotheses
respecting Life, Sensation, and Volition.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">I shall</span> not attempt to
explain the details of these anatomical investigations; and I shall
speak very briefly of the speculations which have been suggested by
the obvious subservience of the nerves to life, sensation, and
volition. Some general inferences from their distribution were
sufficiently obvious; as, that the seat of sensation and volition is
in the brain. Galen begins his work, <i>On the Anatomy of the
Nerves</i>, thus: “That none of the members of the animal either
exercises voluntary motion, or receives sensation, and that if the
nerve be cut, the part immediately becomes inert and insensible, is
acknowledged by all physicians. But that the origin of the nerves is
partly from the brain, and partly from the spinal marrow, I proceed to
explain.” And in his work <i>On the Doctrines of Plato and
Hippocrates</i>, he proves at <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page465">465</a></span> great length<a id="fnanchor69-17"
href="#note69-17"><span class="fnanchor">69</span></a> that the brain
is the origin of sensation and motion, refuting the opinions of
earlier days, as that of Chrysippus,<a id="fnanchor70-17"
href="#note70-17"><span class="fnanchor">70</span></a> who placed the
<i>hegemonic</i> or master-principle of the soul, in the heart. But
though Galen thought that the rational soul resides in the brain, he
was disposed to agree with the poets and philosophers, according to
whom the heart is the seat of courage and anger, and the liver the
seat of love.<a id="fnanchor71-17" href="#note71-17"><span
class="fnanchor">71</span></a> The faculties of the soul were by
succeeding physiologists confined to the brain; but the disposition
still showed itself, to attribute to them distinct localities. Thus
Willis<a id="fnanchor72-17" href="#note72-17"><span
class="fnanchor">72</span></a> places the imagination in the <i>corpus
callosum</i>, the memory in the folds of the <i>hemispheres</i>, the
perception in the <i>corpus striatum</i>. In more recent times, a
system founded upon a similar view has been further developed by Gall
and his followers. The germ of Gall’s system may be considered as
contained in that of Willis; for Gall represents the hemispheres as
the folds of a great membrane which is capable of being unwrapped and
spread out, and places the different faculties of man in the different
regions of this membrane. The chasm which intervenes between matter
and motion on the one side, and thought and feeling on the other, is
brought into view by all such systems; but none of the hypotheses
which they involve can effectually bridge it over.</p>

<p>The same observation may be made respecting the attempts to explain
the manner in which the nerves operate as the instruments of sensation
and volition. Perhaps a real step was made by Glisson,<a
id="fnanchor73-17" href="#note73-17"><span
class="fnanchor">73</span></a> professor of medicine in the University
of Cambridge, who distinguished in the fibres of the muscles of motion
a peculiar property, different from any merely mechanical or physical
action. His work <i>On the Nature of the Energetic Substance, or on
the Life of Nature and of its Three First Faculties, The Perceptive,
Appetitive, and Motive</i>, which was published in 1672, is rather
metaphysical than physiological. But the principles which he
establishes in this treatise he applies more specially to physiology
in a treatise <i>On the Stomach and Intestines</i> (Amsterdam, 1677).
In this he ascribes to the fibres of the animal body a peculiar power
which he calls <i>Irritability</i>. He divides <i>irritation</i> into
natural, vital, and animal; and he points out, though briefly, the
gradual differences of irritability in different organs. “It is hardly
comprehensible,” says Sprengel,<a id="fnanchor74-17"
href="#note74-17"><span class="fnanchor">74</span></a> “how this <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page466">466</a></span> lucid and excellent
notion of the Cambridge teacher was not accepted with greater
alacrity, and further unfolded by his contemporaries.” It has,
however, since been universally adopted.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note73-17"

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note74-17"
href="#fnanchor74-17">74</a></span> Spr. iv. 47.</div>
<p>But though the discrimination of muscular irritability as a
peculiar power might be a useful step in physiological research, the
explanations hitherto offered, of the way in which the nerves operate
on this irritability, and discharge their other offices, present only
a series of hypotheses. Glisson<a id="fnanchor75-17"
href="#note75-17"><span class="fnanchor">75</span></a> assumed the
existence of certain vital spirits, which, according to him, are a
mild, sweet fluid, resembling the spirituous part of white of egg, and
residing in the nerves.&#8212;This hypothesis, of a very subtle humor
or spirit existing in the nerves, was indeed very early taken up.<a
id="fnanchor76-17" href="#note76-17"><span
class="fnanchor">76</span></a> This nervous spirit had been compared
to air by Erasistratus, Asclepiades, Galen, and others. The chemical
tendencies of the seventeenth century led to its being described as
acid, sulphureous or nitrous. At the end of that century, the
hypothesis of an <i>ether</i> attracted much notice as a means of
accounting for many phenomena; and this ether was identified with the
nervous fluid. Newton himself inclines to this view, in the remarkable
Queries which are annexed to his <i>Opticks</i>. After ascribing many
physical effects to his ether, he adds (Query 23), “Is not vision
performed chiefly by the vibrations of this medium, excited in the
bottom of the eye by the rays of light, and propagated through the
solid, pellucid, and uniform capillamenta of the nerves into the place
of sensation?” And (Query 24), “Is not animal motion performed by the
vibrations of this medium, excited in the brain by the power of the
will, and propagated from thence through the capillamenta of the
nerves into the muscles for contracting and dilating them?” And an
opinion approaching this has been adopted by some of the greatest of
modern physiologists; as Haller, who says,<a id="fnanchor77-17"
href="#note77-17"><span class="fnanchor">77</span></a> that, though it
is more easy to find what this nervous spirit is not than what it is,
he conceives that, while it must be far too fine to be perceived by
the sense, it must yet be more gross than fire, magnetism, or
electricity; so that it may be contained in vessels, and confined by
boundaries. And Cuvier speaks to the same effect:<a id="fnanchor78-17"
href="#note78-17"><span class="fnanchor">78</span></a> “There is a
great probability that it is by an imponderable fluid that the nerve
acts on the fibre, and that this nervous fluid is drawn from the
blood, and secreted by the medullary matter.”</p>

<p>Without presuming to dissent from such authorities on a point of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page467">467</a></span> anatomical
probability, we may venture to observe, that these hypotheses do not
tend at all to elucidate the physiological principle which is here
involved; for this principle cannot be mechanical, chemical, or
physical, and therefore cannot be better understood by embodying it in
a fluid; the difficulty we have in conceiving what the moving force
<em>is</em>, is not got rid of by explaining the machinery by which it is
merely <em>transferred</em>. In tracing the phenomena of sensation and
volition to their cause, it is clear that we must call in some
peculiar and hyperphysical principle. The hypothesis of a fluid is not
made more satisfactory by attenuating the fluid; it becomes subtle,
spirituous, ethereal, imponderable, to no purpose; it must cease to be
a fluid, before its motions can become sensation and volition. This,
indeed, is acknowledged by most physiologists; and strongly stated by
Cuvier.<a id="fnanchor79-17" href="#note79-17"><span
class="fnanchor">79</span></a> “The impression of external objects
upon the <span class="sc">me</span>, the production of a sensation, of
an image, is a mystery impenetrable for our thoughts.” And in several
places, by the use of this peculiar phrase, “<i>the me</i>,” (<i>le
moi</i>) for the sentient and volent faculty, he marks, with peculiar
appropriateness and force, that phraseology borrowed from the world of
matter will, in this subject, no longer answer our purpose. We have
here to go from Nouns to Pronouns, from Things to Persons. We pass
from the Body to the Soul, from Physics to Metaphysics. We are come to
the borders of material philosophy; the next step is into the domain
of Thought and Mind. Here, therefore, we begin to feel that we have
reached the boundaries of our present subject. The examination of that
which lies beyond them must be reserved for a philosophy of another
kind, and for the labors of the future; if we are ever enabled to make
the attempt to extend into that loftier and wider scene, the
principles which we gather on the ground we are now laboriously
treading.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note79-17"
href="#fnanchor79-17">79</a></span> <i>Règne Animal</i>, Introd. p.
47.</div>
<p>Such speculations as I have quoted respecting the nervous fluid,
proceeding from some of the greatest philosophers who ever lived,
prove only that hitherto the endeavor to comprehend the mystery of
perception and will, of life and thought, have been fruitless and
vain. Many anatomical truths have been discovered, but, so far as our
survey has yet gone, no genuine physiological principle. All the
trains of physiological research which we have followed have begun in
exact examination of organization and function, and have ended in wide
conjectures and arbitrary hypotheses. The stream of knowledge in all
such cases is <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page468">468</a></span>
clear and lively at its outset; but, instead of reaching the great
ocean of the general truths of science, it is gradually spread abroad
among sands and deserts till its course can be traced no longer.</p>
<p>Hitherto, therefore, we must consider that we have had to tell the
story of the <em>failures</em> of physiological speculation. But of
late there have come into view and use among physiologists certain
principles which may be considered as peculiar to organized subjects;
and of which the introduction forms a real advance in organical
science. Though these have hitherto been very imperfectly developed,
we must endeavor to exhibit, in some measure, their history and
bearing.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [In order to show that I am not unaware how imperfect the
sketch given in this work is, as a History of Physiology, I may refer
to the further discussions on these subjects contained in the
<i>Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences</i>, Book ix. I have there
(Chap. ii.) noticed the successive <i>Biological Hypotheses</i> of the
Mystical, the Iatrochemical, and Iatromathematical Schools, the
Vital-Fluid School, and the Psychical School. I have (Chaps. iii.,
iv., v.) examined several of the attempts which have been made to
analyze the Idea of Life, to classify Vital Functions, and to form
Ideas of Separate Vital Forces. I have considered in particular, the
attempts to form a distinct conception of Assimilation and Secretion,
of Generation, and of Voluntary Motion; and I have (Chap. vi.) further
discussed the Idea of Final Causes as employed in Biology.]</p>

<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Vegetable Morphology. Göthe.
De Candolle.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">BEFORE</span> we proceed to consider
the progress of principles which belong to animal and human life, such
as have just been pointed at, we must look round for such doctrines,
if any such there be, as apply alike to all organized beings,
conscious or unconscious, fixed or locomotive;&#8212;to the laws which
regulate vegetable as well as animal forms and functions. Though we
are very far from being able to present a <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page469">469</a></span> clear and connected code of such laws,
we may refer to one law, at least, which appears to be of genuine
authority and validity; and which is worthy our attention as an
example of a properly organical or physiological principle, distinct
from all mechanical, chemical, or other physical forces; and such as
cannot even be conceived to be resolvable into those. I speak of the
tendency which produces such results as have been brought together in
recent speculations upon <i>Morphology</i>.</p>
<p>It may perhaps be regarded as indicating how peculiar are the
principles of organic life, and how far removed from any mere
mechanical action, that the leading idea in these speculations was
first strongly and effectively apprehended, not by a laborious
experimenter and reasoner, but by a man of singularly brilliant and
creative fancy; not by a mathematician or chemist, but by a poet. And
we may add further, that this poet had already shown himself incapable
of rightly apprehending the relation of physical facts to their
principles; and had, in trying his powers on such subjects, exhibited
a signal instance of the ineffectual and perverse operation of the
method of philosophizing to which the constitution of his mind led
him. The person of whom we speak, is John Wolfgang Göthe, who is held,
by the unanimous voice of Europe, to have been one of the greatest
poets of our own, or of any time, and whose <i>Doctrine of Colors</i>
we have already had to <a href="#v2page63">describe</a>, in the
History of Optics, as an entire failure. Yet his views on the laws
which connect the forms of plants into one simple system, have been
generally accepted and followed up. We might almost be led to think
that this writer’s poetical endowments had contributed to this
scientific discovery;&#8212;the love of beauty of form, by fixing the
attention upon the symmetry of plants; and the creative habit of
thought, by making constant developement of a familiar process.<a

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page470">470</a></span> But though
we cannot but remark the peculiarity of our being indebted to a poet
for the discovery of a scientific principle, we must not forget that
he himself held, that in making this step, he had been guided, not by
his invention, but by observation. He repelled, with extreme
repugnance, the notion that he had substituted fancy for fact, or
imposed ideal laws on actual things. While he was earnestly pursuing
his morphological speculations, he attempted to impress them upon
Schiller. “I expounded to him, in as lively a manner as possible, the
metamorphosis of plants, drawing on paper, with many characteristic
strokes, a symbolic plant before his eyes. He heard me,” Göthe says,<a
id="fnanchor81-17" href="#note81-17"><span
class="fnanchor">81</span></a> “with much interest and distinct
comprehension; but when I had done, he shook his head, and said, ‘That
is not Experience; that is an Idea:’ I stopt with some degree of
irritation; for the point which separated us was marked most
luminously by this expression.” And in the same work he relates his
botanical studies and his habit of observation, from which it is
easily seen that no common amount of knowledge and notice of details,
were involved in the course of thought which led him to the principle
of the Metamorphosis of Plants.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note81-17"
href="#fnanchor81-17">81</a></span><i> Zur Morphologie</i>, p.
24.</div>
<p>Before I state the history of this principle, I may be allowed to
endeavor to communicate to the reader, to whom this subject is new,
some conception of the principle itself. This will not be difficult,
if he will imagine to himself a flower, for instance, a common
wild-rose, or the blossom of an apple-tree, as consisting of a series
of parts disposed in <i>whorls</i>, placed one over another on an
<i>axis</i>. The lowest whorl is the calyx with its five sepals; above
this is the corolla with its five petals; above this are a multitude
of stamens, which may be considered as separate whorls of five each,
often repeated; above these is a whorl composed of the ovaries, or
what become the seed-vessels in the fruit, which are five united
together in the apple, but indefinite in number and separate in the
rose. Now the morphological view is <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page471">471</a></span> this;&#8212;that the members of each of
these whorls are in their nature identical, and the same as if they
were whorls of ordinary leaves, brought together by the shortening
their common axis, and modified in form by the successive elaboration
of their nutriment. Further, according to this view, a whorl of leaves
itself is to be considered as identical with several detached leaves
dispersed spirally along the axis, and brought together because the
axis is shortened. Thus all the parts of a plant are, or at least
represent, the successive metamorphoses of the same elementary member.
The root-leaves thus pass into the common leaves;&#8212;these into
bracteæ;&#8212;these into the sepals;&#8212;these into the
petals;&#8212;these into the stamens with their anthers;&#8212;these
into the ovaries with their styles and stigmas;&#8212;these ultimately
become the fruit; and thus we are finally led to the seed of a new
plant.</p>
<p>Moreover the same notion of metamorphosis may be applied to explain
the existence of flowers which are not symmetrical like those we have
just referred to, but which have an irregular corolla or calyx. The
papilionaceous flower of the pea tribe, which is so markedly
irregular, may be deduced by easy gradations from the regular flower,
(through the <i>mimoseæ</i>,) by expanding one petal, joining one or
two others, and modifying the form of the intermediate ones.</p>
<p>Without attempting to go into detail respecting the proofs of that
identity of all the different organs, and all the different forms of
plants, which is thus asserted, we may observe, that it rests on such
grounds as these;&#8212;the transformations which the parts of flowers
undergo by accidents of nutriment or exposure. Such changes,
considered as monstrosities where they are very remarkable, show the
tendencies and possibilities belonging to the organization in which
they occur. For instance, the single wild-rose, by culture, transforms
many of its numerous stamens into petals, and thus acquires the deeply
folded flower of the double garden-rose. We cannot doubt of the
reality of this change, for we often see stamens in which it is
incomplete. In other cases we find petals becoming leaves, and a
branch growing out of the centre of the flower. Some pear-trees, when
in blossom, are remarkable for their tendencies to such
monstrosities.<a id="fnanchor82-17" href="#note82-17"><span
class="fnanchor">82</span></a> Again, we find that flowers which are
usually irregular, occasionally become regular, and conversely. The
common snap-dragon (<i>Linaria vulgaris</i>) affords a curious
instance of this.<a id="fnanchor83-17" href="#note83-17"><span
class="fnanchor">83</span></a> The usual form of this plant is
“personate,” the corolla being divided into two lobes, which differ in
form, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page472">472</a></span>
together present somewhat the appearance of an animal’s face; and the
upper portion of the corolla is prolonged backwards into a tube-like
“spur.” No flower can be more irregular; but there is a singular
variety of this plants termed <i>Peloria</i>, in which the corolla is
strictly symmetrical, consisting of a conical tube, narrowed in front,
elongated behind into five equal spurs, and containing five stamens of
equal length, instead of the two unequal pairs of the didynamous
Linaria. These and the like appearances show that there is in nature a
capacity for, and tendency to, such changes as the doctrine of
metamorphosis asserts.</p>

<p>Göthe’s <i>Metamorphosis of Plants</i> was published 1790: and his
system was the result of his own independent course of thoughts. The
view which it involved was not, however, absolutely new, though it had
never before been unfolded in so distinct and persuasive a manner.
Linnæus considered the leaves, calyx, corolla, stamens, each as
evolved in succession from the other; and spoke of it as
<i>prolepsis</i> or <i>anticipation</i>,<a id="fnanchor84-17"
href="#note84-17"><span class="fnanchor">84</span></a> when the leaves
changed accidentally into bracteæ, these into a calyx, this into a
corolla, the corolla into stamens, or these into the pistil. And
Caspar Wolf apprehended in a more general manner the same principle.
“In the whole plant,” says he,<a id="fnanchor85-17"
href="#note85-17"><span class="fnanchor">85</span></a> “we see nothing
but leaves and stalk;” and in order to prove what is the situation of
the leaves in all their later forms, he adduces the cotyledons as the
first leaves.</p>

<p>Göthe was led to his system on this subject by his general views of
nature. He saw, he says,<a id="fnanchor86-17" href="#note86-17"><span
class="fnanchor">86</span></a> that a whole life of talent and labor
was requisite to enable any one to arrange the infinitely copious
organic forms of a single kingdom of nature. “Yet I felt,” he adds,
“that for me there must be another way, analogous to the rest of my
habits. The appearance of the changes, round and round, of organic
creatures had taken strong hold on my mind. Imagination and Nature
appeared to me to vie with each other which could go on most boldly
yet most consistently.” His observation of nature, directed by such a
thought, led him to the doctrine of the metamorphosis.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note86-17"
href="#fnanchor86-17">86</a></span> <i>Zur Morph.</i> i. 30.</div>
<p>In a later republication of his work (<i>Zur Morphologie</i>,
1817,) he gives a very agreeable account of the various circumstances
which affected the reception and progress of his doctrine. Willdenow<a
id="fnanchor87-17" href="#note87-17"><span
class="fnanchor">87</span></a> quoted <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page473">473</a></span> him thus:&#8212;“The life of plants is,
as Mr. Göthe very prettily says, an expansion and contraction, and
these alternations make the various periods of life.” “This
‘<i>prettily</i>,’” says Göthe, “I can be well content with, but the
‘<em>egregie</em>,’ of Usteri is much more pretty and obliging.”
Usteri had used this term respecting Göthe in an edition of
Jussieu.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note87-17"
href="#fnanchor87-17">87</a></span> <i>Zur Morph.</i> i. 121.</div>
<p>The application of the notion of metamorphosis to the explanation
of double and monstrous flowers had been made previously by
Jussieu. Göthe’s merit was, to have referred to it the <em>regular</em>
formation of the flower. And as Sprengel justly says,<a
id="fnanchor88-17" href="#note88-17"><span
class="fnanchor">88</span></a> his view had so profound a meaning,
made so strong an appeal by its simplicity, and was so fruitful in the
most valuable consequences, that it was not to be wondered at if it
occasioned further examination of the subject; although many persons
pretend to slight it. The task of confirming and verifying the
doctrine by a general application of it to all cases,&#8212;a labor so
important and necessary after the promulgation of any great
principle,&#8212;Göthe himself did not execute. At first he collected
specimens and made drawings with some such view,<a id="fnanchor89-17"
href="#note89-17"><span class="fnanchor">89</span></a> but he was
interrupted and diverted to other matters. “And now,” says he, in his
later publication, “when I look back on this undertaking, it is easy
to see that the object which I had before my eyes was, for me, in my
position, with my habits and mode of thinking, unattainable. For it
was no less than this: that I was to take that which I had stated in
general, and presented to the conception, to the mental intuition, in
words; and that I should, in a particularly visible, orderly, and
gradual manner, present it to the eye; so as to show to the outward
sense that out of the germ of this idea might grow a tree of
physiology fit to overshadow the world.”</p>

<p>Voigt, professor at Jena, was one of the first who adopted Göthe’s
view into an elementary work, which he did in 1808. Other botanists
labored in the direction which had thus been pointed out. Of those who
have thus contributed to the establishment and developement of the
metamorphic doctrine. Professor De Candolle, of Geneva, is perhaps the
most important. His Theory of Developement rests upon two main
principles, <i>abortion</i> and <i>adhesion</i>. By considering some
parts as degenerated or absent through the abortion of the buds which
might have formed them, and other parts as adhering together, he holds
that all plants may be reduced to perfect symmetry: and the actual and
constant occurrence of such incidents is shown beyond <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page474">474</a></span> all doubt. And thus
the snap-dragon, of which we have spoken above, is derived from the
Peloria, which is the normal condition of the flower, by the abortion
of one stamen, and the degeneration of two others. Such examples are
too numerous to need to be dwelt on.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Application of Vegetable
Morphology.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> doctrine, being thus
fully established, has been applied to solve different problems in
botany; for instance, to explain the structure of flowers which appear
at first sight to deviate widely from the usual forms of the vegetable
world. We have an instance of such an application in Mr. Robert
Brown’s explanation of the real structure of various plants which had
been entirely misunderstood: as, for example, the genus
<i>Euphorbia</i>. In this plant he showed that what had been held to
be a jointed filament, was a pedicel with a filament above it, the
intermediate corolla having evanesced. In <i>Orchideæ</i> (the orchis
tribe), he showed that the peculiar structure of the plant arose from
its having six stamens (two sets of three each), of which five are
usually abortive. In <i>Coniferæ</i> (the cone-bearing trees), it was
made to appear that the seed was naked, while the accompanying
appendage, corresponding to a seed-vessel, assumed all forms, from a
complete leaf to a mere scale. In like manner it was proved that the
<i>pappus</i>, or down of <i>composite</i> plants (as thistles), is a
transformed calyx.</p>
<p>Along with this successful application of a profound principle, it
was natural that other botanists should make similar attempts. Thus
Mr. Lindley was led to take a view<a id="fnanchor90-17"
href="#note90-17"><span class="fnanchor">90</span></a> of the
structure of <i>Reseda</i> (mignonette) different from that usually
entertained; which, when published, attracted a good deal of
attention, and gained some converts among the botanists of Germany and
France. But in 1833, Mr. Lindley says, with great candor, “Lately,
Professor Henslow has satisfactorily proved, in part by the aid of a
monstrosity in the common <i>Mignonette</i>, in part by a severe
application of morphological rules, that my hypothesis must
necessarily be false.” Such an agreement of different botanists
respecting the consequences of morphological rules, proves the reality
and universality of the rules.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note90-17"
href="#fnanchor90-17">90</a></span> Lindley, <i>Brit. Assoc.
Report</i>, iii. 50.</div>
<p>We find, therefore, that a principle which we may call the
<i>Principle of Developed and Metamorphosed Symmetry</i>, is firmly
established <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page475">475</a></span> and
recognized, and familiarly and successfully applied by botanists. And
it will be apparent, on reflection, that though <i>symmetry</i> is a
notion which applies to inorganic as well as to organic things, and
is, in fact, a conception of certain relations of space and position,
such <i>developement</i> and <i>metamorphosis</i> as are here spoken
of, are ideas entirely different from any of those to which the
physical sciences have led us in our previous survey; and are, in
short, genuine <i>organical</i> or <i>physiological</i>
ideas;&#8212;real elements of the philosophy of <i>life</i>.</p>
<p>We must, however imperfectly, endeavor to trace the application of
this idea in the other great department of the world of life; we must
follow the history of Animal Morphology.</p>

<span class="sc">Progress of Animal Morphology.</span></h3>
<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Rise of Comparative
Anatomy.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> most general and constant
relations of the form of the organs, both in plants and animals, are
the most natural grounds of classification. Hence the first scientific
classifications of animals are the first steps in animal morphology.
At first, a <i>zoology</i> was constructed by arranging animals, as
plants were at first arranged, according to their external parts. But
in the course of the researches of the anatomists of the seventeenth
century, it was seen that the internal structure of animals offered
resemblances and transitions of a far more coherent and philosophical
kind, and the Science of <i>Comparative Anatomy</i> rose into favor
and importance. Among the main cultivators of this science<a
id="fnanchor91-17" href="#note91-17"><span
class="fnanchor">91</span></a> at the period just mentioned, we find
Francis Redi, of Arezzo; Guichard-Joseph Duvernay, who was for sixty
years Professor of Anatomy at the Jardin du Roi at Paris, and during
this lapse of time had for his pupils almost all the greatest
anatomists of the greater part of the eighteenth century; Nehemiah
Grew, secretary to the Royal Society of London, whose <i>Anatomy of
Plants</i> we have <a href="#v2page457">already</a> noticed.</p>

<p>But Comparative Anatomy, which had been cultivated with ardor <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page476">476</a></span> to the end of the
seventeenth century, was, in some measure, neglected during the first
two-thirds of the eighteenth. The progress of botany was, Cuvier
sagaciously suggests,<a id="fnanchor92-17" href="#note92-17"><span
class="fnanchor">92</span></a> one cause of this; for that science had
made its advances by confining itself to external characters, and
rejecting anatomy; and though Linnæus acknowledged the dependence of
zoology upon anatomy<a id="fnanchor93-17" href="#note93-17"><span
class="fnanchor">93</span></a> so far as to make the number of teeth
his characters, even this was felt, in his method, as a bold step. But
his influence was soon opposed by that of Buffon, Daubenton, and
Pallas; who again brought into view the importance of comparative
anatomy in Zoology; at the same time that Haller proved how much might
be learnt from it in Physiology. John Hunter in England, the two
Monros in Scotland, Camper in Holland, and Vicq d’Azyr in France, were
the first to follow the path thus pointed out. Camper threw the glance
of genius on a host of interesting objects, but almost all that he
produced was a number of sketches; Vicq d’Azyr, more assiduous, was
stopt in the midst of a most brilliant career by a premature
death.</p>

href="#fnanchor93-17">93</a></span> Ib.</div>
<p>Such is Cuvier’s outline of the earlier history of comparative
anatomy. We shall not go into detail upon this subject; but we may
observe that such studies had fixed in the minds of naturalists the
conviction of the possibility and the propriety of considering large
divisions of the animal kingdom as modifications of one common
<i>type</i>. Belon, as early as 1555, had placed the skeleton of a man
and a bird side by side, and shown the correspondence of parts. So far
as the case of vertebrated animals extends, this correspondence is
generally allowed; although it required some ingenuity to detect its
details in some cases; for instance, to see the analogy of parts
between the head of a man and a fish.</p>
<p>In tracing these less obvious correspondencies, some curious steps
have been made in recent times. And here we must, I conceive, again
ascribe no small merit to the same remarkable man who, as we have
already had to point out, gave so great an impulse to vegetable
morphology. Göthe, whose talent and disposition for speculating on all
parts of nature were truly admirable, was excited to the study of
anatomy by his propinquity to the Duke of Weimar’s cabinet of natural
history. In 1786, he published a little essay, the object of which was
to show that in man, as well as in beasts, the upper jaw contains an
intermaxillary bone, although the sutures are obliterated. After
1790,<a id="fnanchor94-17" href="#note94-17"><span
class="fnanchor">94</span></a> animated and impelled by the same
passion for natural <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page477">477</a></span> observation and for general views, which
had produced his Metamorphosis of Plants, he pursued his speculations
on these subjects eagerly and successfully. And in 1795, he published
a <i>Sketch of a Universal Introduction into Comparative Anatomy,
beginning with Osteology</i>; in which he attempts to establish an
“osteological type,” to which skeletons of all animals may be
referred. I do not pretend that Göthe’s anatomical works have had any
influence on the progress of the science comparable with that which
has been exercised by the labors of professional anatomists; but the
ingenuity and value of the views which they contained was acknowledged
by the best authorities; and the clearer introduction and application
of the principle of developed and metamorphosed symmetry may be dated
from about this time. Göthe declares that, at an early period of these
speculations, he was convinced<a id="fnanchor95-17"
href="#note95-17"><span class="fnanchor">95</span></a> that the bony
head of beasts is to be derived from six vertebræ. In 1807, Oken
published a “Program” <i>On the Signification of the Bones of the
Skull</i>, in which he maintained that these bones are equivalent to
four vertebræ); and Meckel, in his <i>Comparative Anatomy</i>, in
1811, also resolved the skull into vertebræ. But Spix, in his
elaborate work <i>Cephalogenesis</i>, in 1815, reduced the vertebræ of
the head to three. “Oken,” he says,<a id="fnanchor96-17"
href="#note96-17"><span class="fnanchor">96</span></a> “published
opinions merely theoretical, and consequently contrary to those
maintained in this work, which are drawn from observation.” This
resolution of the head into vertebræ is assented to by many of the
best physiologists, as explaining the distribution of the nerves, and
other phenomena. Spix further extended the application of the
vertebral theory to the heads of all classes of vertebrate animals;
and Bojanus published a Memoir expressly on the vertebral structure of
the skulls of fishes in Oken’s <i>Isis</i> for 1818. Geoffroy
Saint-Hilaire presented a lithographic plate to the French Academy in
February 1824, entitled <i>Composition de la Tête <span
class="correction" title="emended from osseuze">osseuse</span> chez
l’Homme et les Animaux</i>, and developed his views of the vertebral
composition of the skull in two Memoirs published in the <i>Annales
des Sciences Naturelles</i> for 1824. We cannot fail to recognize here
the attempt to apply to the skeleton of animals the principle which
leads botanists to consider all the parts of a flower as
transformations of the same organs. How far the application of the
principle, as here proposed, is just, I must leave philosophical
physiologists to decide.</p>

<p>By these and similar researches, it is held by the best

that the skull of all vertebrate animals is pretty well reduced to a
uniform structure, and the laws of its variations nearly determined.<a

<p>The vertebrate animals being thus reduced to a single type, the
question arises how far this can be done with regard to other animals,
and how many such types there are. And here we come to one of the
important services which Cuvier rendered to natural history.</p>
<h4 id="b17-7-2"><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Distinction of the General
Types of the Forms of Animals.&#8212;Cuvier.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Animals</span> were divided by
Lamarck into vertebrate and invertebrate; and the general analogies of
all vertebrate animals are easily made manifest. But with regard to
other animals, the point is far from clear. Cuvier was the first to
give a really philosophical view of the animal world in reference to
the plan on which each animal is constructed. There are,<a
id="fnanchor98-17" href="#note98-17"><span
class="fnanchor">98</span></a> he says, four such plans;&#8212;four
forms on which animals appear to have been modelled; and of which the
ulterior divisions, with whatever titles naturalists have decorated
them, are only very slight modifications, founded on the development
or addition of some parts which do not produce any essential change in
the plan.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note98-17"
href="#fnanchor98-17">98</a></span> <i>Règne Animal</i>, p. 57.</div>
<p>These four great branches of the animal world are the
<i>vertebrata</i>, <i>mollusca</i>, <i>articulata</i>, <i>radiata</i>;
and the differences of these are so important that a slight
explanation of them may be permitted.</p>
<p>The <i>vertebrata</i> are those animals which (as man and other
sucklers, birds, fishes, lizards, frogs, serpents) have a backbone and
a skull with lateral appendages, within which the viscera are
included, and to which the muscles are attached.</p>
<p>The <i>mollusca</i>, or soft animals, have no bony skeleton; the
muscles are attached to the skin, which often includes stony plates
called <i>shells</i>; such molluscs are shell-fish; others are
cuttle-fish, and many pulpy sea-animals.</p>
<p>The <i>articulata</i> consist of <i>crustacea</i> (lobsters,
&amp;c.), <i>insects</i>, <i>spiders</i>, and <i>annulose worms</i>,
which consist of a head and a number of successive annular portions of
the body <i>jointed</i> together (to the interior of which the muscles
are attached), whence the name.</p>
<p>Finally, the <i>radiata</i> include the animals known under the
name of <i>zoophytes</i>. In the preceding three branches the organs
of motion and of sense were distributed symmetrically on the two sides
of an axis, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page479">479</a></span> so
that the animal has a right and a left side. In the radiata the
similar members radiate from the axis in a circular manner, like the
petals of a regular flower.</p>
<p>The whole value of such a classification cannot be understood
without explaining its use in enabling us to give general
descriptions, and general laws of the animal functions of the classes
which it includes; but in the present part of our work our business is
to exhibit it as an exemplification of the reduction of animals to
laws of Symmetry. The bipartite Symmetry of the form of vertebrate and
articulate animals is obvious; and the reduction of the various forms
of such animals to a common type has been effected, by attention to
their anatomy, in a manner which has satisfied those who have best
studied the subject. The molluscs, especially those in which the head
disappears, as oysters, or those which are rolled into a spiral, as
snails, have a less obvious Symmetry, but here also we can apply
certain general types. And the Symmetry of the radiated zoophytes is
of a nature quite different from all the rest, and approaching, as we
have suggested, to the kind of Symmetry found in plants. Some
naturalists have doubted whether<a id="fnanchor99-17"
href="#note99-17"><span class="fnanchor">99</span></a> these zoophytes
are not referrible to two types (<i>acrita</i> or polypes, and true
<i>radiata</i>,) rather than to one.</p>

<p>This fourfold division was introduced by Cuvier.<a
id="fnanchor100-17" href="#note100-17"><span
class="fnanchor">100</span></a> Before him, naturalists followed
Linnæus, and divided non-vertebrate animals into two classes, insects
and worms. “I began,” says Cuvier, “to attack this view of the
subject, and offered another division, in a Memoir read at the Society
of Natural History of Paris, the 21st of Floreal, in the year III. of
the Republic (May 10, 1795,) printed in the <i>Décade
Philosophique</i>: in this, I mark the characters and the limits of
molluscs, insects, worms, echinoderms, and zoophytes. I distinguish
the red-blooded worms or annelides, in a Memoir read to the Institute,
the 11th Nivose, year X. (December 31, 1801.) I afterwards distributed
these different classes into three branches, each co-ordinate to the
branch formed by the vertebrate animals, in a Memoir read to the
Institute in July, 1812, printed in the <i>Annales du Muséum
d’Histoire Naturelle</i>, tom. xix.” His great systematic work, the
<i>Règne Animal</i>, founded on this distribution, was published in
1817; and since that time the division has been commonly accepted
among naturalists.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note100-17"
href="#fnanchor100-17">100</a></span> <i>Règne A.</i> 61.</div>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [The question of the Classification of Animals is
discussed in the first of Prof. Owen’s <i>Lectures on the
Invertebrate</i> <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page480">480</a></span> <i>Animals</i> (1843). Mr. Owen observes
that the arrangement of animals into <i>Vertebrate</i> and
<i>Invertebrate</i> which prevailed before Cuvier, was necessarily
bad, inasmuch as no <em>negative</em> character in Zoology gives true
natural groups. Hence the establishment of the <i>sub-kingdoms</i>,
<i>Mollusca</i>, <i>Articulata</i>, <i>Radiata</i>, as co-ordinate
with <i>Vertebrata</i>, according to the arrangement of the nervous
system, was a most important advance. But Mr. Owen has seen reason to
separate the <i>Radiata</i> of Cuvier into two divisions; the
<i>Nematoneura</i>, in which the nervous system can be traced in a
filamentary form (including <i>Echinoderma</i>, <i>Ciliobrachiata</i>,
<i>Cœlelmintha</i>, <i>Rotifera</i>,) and the <i>Acrita</i> or lowest
division of the animal kingdom, including <i>Acalepha</i>,
<i>Nudibrachiata</i>, <i>Sterelmintha</i>, <i>Polygastria</i>.]

that all vertebrate animals were constructed so exactly upon the same
plan as to preserve the strictest analogy of parts in respect to their
osteology, thought to extend this unity of plan by demonstrating, that
the hard parts of crustaceans and insects are still only modifications
of the skeleton of higher animals, and that therefore the type of
vertebrata must be made to include them also:&#8212;the segments of
the articulata are held to be strictly analogous to the vertebras of
the higher animals, and thus the former live <em>within</em> their
vertebral column in the same manner as the latter live
<em>without</em> it. Attempts have even been made to reduce molluscous
and vertebrate animals to a community of type, as we shall see
shortly.</p>

<p>Another application of the principle, according to which creatures
the most different are developments of the same original type, may be
discerned<a id="fnanchor102-17" href="#note102-17"><span

the higher forms of animal life passes by gradations through those
forms which are <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page481">481</a></span>
permanent in inferior animals. Thus, according to this view, the human
fœtus assumes successively the plan of the zoophyte, the worm, the
fish, the turtle, the bird, the beast. But it has been well observed,
that “in these analogies we look in vain for the precision which can
alone support the inference that has been deduced;”<a
id="fnanchor103-17" href="#note103-17"><span

<p>Cuvier<a id="fnanchor104-17" href="#note104-17"><span

the attempts to refer the different divisions of his system to a
common type. “He could not admit,” says his biographer, “that the
lungs or gills of the vertebrates are in the same connexion as the
branchiæ of molluscs and crustaceans, which in the one are situated at
the base of the feet, or fixed on the feet themselves, and in the
other often on the back or about the arms. He did not admit the
analogy between the skeleton of the vertebrates and the skin of the
articulates; he could not believe that the tænia and the sepia were
constructed on the same plan; that there was a similarity of
composition between the bird and the echinus, the whale and the snail;
in spite of the skill with which some persons sought gradually to
efface their discrepancies.”</p>

<p>Whether it may be possible to establish, among the four great
divisions of the “Animal Kingdom,” some analogies of a higher order
than those which prevail within each division, I do not pretend to
conjecture. If this can be done, it is clear that it must be by
comparing the types of these divisions under their most general forms:
and thus Cuvier’s arrangement, so far as it is itself rightly founded
on the unity of composition of each branch, is the surest step to the
discovery of a unity pervading and uniting these branches. But those
who generalize surely, and those who generalize rapidly, may travel in
the same direction, they soon separate so widely, that they appear to
move from each other. The partisans of a universal “unity of
composition” of animals, accused Cuvier of being too inert in
following the progress of physiological and zoological science.
Borrowing their illustration from the political parties of the times,
they asserted that he belonged to the science of <em>resistance</em>,
not to the science of the <em>movement</em>. Such a charge was highly
honorable to him; for no one acquainted with the history of zoology
can doubt that he had a great share in the impulse by which the
“movement” was occasioned; or that he <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page482">482</a></span> himself made a large advance with it;
and it was because he was so poised by the vast mass of his knowledge,
so temperate in his love of doubtful generalizations, that he was not
swept on in the wilder part of the stream. To such a charge, moderate
reformers, who appreciate the value of the good which exists, though
they try to make it better, and who know the knowledge,
thoughtfulness, and caution, which are needful in such a task, are
naturally exposed. For us, who can only decide on such a subject by
the general analogies of the history of science, it may suffice to
say, that it appears doubtful whether the fundamental conceptions of
affinity, analogy, transition, and developement, have yet been fixed
in the minds of physiologists with sufficient firmness and clearness,
or unfolded with sufficient consistency and generality, to make it
likely that any great additional step of this kind can for some time
be made.</p>
<p>We have here considered the doctrine of the identity of the
seemingly various types of animal structure, as an attempt to extend
the correspondencies which were the basis of Cuvier’s division of the
animal kingdom. But this doctrine has been put forward in another
point of view, as the antithesis to the doctrine of final causes. This
question is so important a one, that we cannot help attempting to give
some view of its state and bearings.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">The Doctrine of Final Causes in
Physiology.</span></h3>
<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Assertion of the Principle
of Unity of Plan.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">WE</span> have repeatedly seen, in
the course of our historical view of Physiology, that those who have
studied the structure of animals and plants, have had a conviction
forced upon them, that the organs are constructed and combined in
subservience to the life and functions of the whole. The parts have a
<em>purpose</em>, as well as a <em>law</em>;&#8212;we can trace Final
Causes, as well as Laws of Causation. This principle is peculiar to
physiology; and it might naturally be expected that, in the progress
of the science, it would come under special consideration. This
accordingly has happened; and the principle has been drawn <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page483">483</a></span> into a prominent
position by the struggle of two antagonistic schools of physiologists.
On the one hand, it has been maintained that this doctrine of final
causes is altogether unphilosophical, and requires to be replaced by a
more comprehensive and profound principle: on the other hand, it is
asserted that the doctrine is not only true, but that, in our own
time, it has been fixed and developed so as to become the instrument
of some of the most important discoveries which have been made. Of the
views of these two schools we must endeavor to give some account.</p>
<p>The disciples of the former of the two schools express their tenets
by the phrases <i>unity</i> of <i>plan</i>, <i>unity</i> of
<i>composition</i>; and the more detailed developement of these
doctrines has been termed the <i>Theory of Analogies</i>, by Geoffroy
Saint-Hilaire, who claims this theory as his own creation. According
to this theory, the structure and functions of animals are to be
studied by the guidance of their analogy only; our attention is to be
turned, not to the fitness of the organization for any end of life or
action, but to its resemblance to other organizations by which it is
gradually derived from the original type.</p>
<p>According to the rival view of this subject, we must not assume,
and cannot establish, that the plan of all animals is the same, or
their composition similar. The existence of a single and universal
system of analogies in the construction of all animals is entirely
unproved, and therefore cannot be made our guide in the study of their
properties. On the other hand, the plan of the animal, the purpose of
its organization in the support of its life, the necessity of the
functions to its existence, are truths which are irresistibly
apparent, and which may therefore be safely taken as the bases of our
reasonings. This view has been put forward as the doctrine of the
<i>conditions of existence</i>: it may also be described as the
principle of <i>a purpose in organization</i>; the structure being
considered as having the function for its end. We must say a few words
on each of these views.</p>
<p>It had been pointed out by Cuvier, as we have seen in the last <a
href="#b17-7-2">chapter</a>, that the animal kingdom may be divided
into four great branches; in each of which the <i>plan</i> of the
animal is different, namely, <i>vertebrata</i>, <i>articulata</i>,
<i>mollusca</i>, <i>radiata</i>. Now the question naturally occurs, is
there really no resemblance of construction in these different
classes? It was maintained by some, that there is such a resemblance.
In 1820,<a id="fnanchor105-17" href="#note105-17"><span
class="fnanchor">105</span></a> M. Audouin, a young naturalist of
Paris, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page484">484</a></span>
endeavored to fill up the chasm which separates insects from other
animals; and by examining carefully the portions which compose the
solid frame-work of insects, and following them through their various
transformations in different classes, he conceived that he found
relations of position and function, and often of number and form,
which might be compared with the relations of the parts of the
skeleton in vertebrate animals. He thought that the first segment of
an insect, the head,<a id="fnanchor106-17" href="#note106-17"><span
class="fnanchor">106</span></a> represents one of the three vertebræ
which, according to Spix and others, compose the vertebrate head: the
second segment of the insects, (the <i>prothorax</i> of Audouin,) is,
according to M. Geoffroy, the second vertebra of the head of the
vertebrata, and so on. Upon this speculation Cuvier<a
id="fnanchor107-17" href="#note107-17"><span
class="fnanchor">107</span></a> does not give any decided opinion;
observing only, that even if false, it leads to active thought and
useful research.</p>

<p>But when an attempt was further made to identify the plan of
another branch of the animal world, the mollusca, with that of the
vertebrata, the radical opposition between such views and those of
Cuvier, broke out into an animated controversy.</p>
<p>Two French anatomists, MM. Laurencet and Meyranx, presented to the
Academy of Sciences, in 1830, a Memoir containing their views on the
organization of molluscous animals; and on the sepia or cuttle-fish in
particular, as one of the most complete examples of such animals.
These creatures, indeed, though thus placed in the same division with
shell-fish of the most defective organization and obscure structure,
are far from being scantily organized. They have a brain,<a
id="fnanchor108-17" href="#note108-17"><span
class="fnanchor">108</span></a> often eyes, and these, in the animals
of this class, (<i>cephalopoda</i>) are more complicated than in any
vertebrates;<a id="fnanchor109-17" href="#note109-17"><span
class="fnanchor">109</span></a> they have sometimes ears, salivary
glands, multiple stomachs, a considerable liver, a bile, a complete
double circulation, provided with auricles and ventricles; in short,
their vital activity is vigorous, and their senses are distinct.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note108-17"
href="#fnanchor108-17">108</a></span> Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire denies
this. <i>Principes de Phil. Zoologique discutés en</i> 1830, p.
68.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note109-17"
href="#fnanchor109-17">109</a></span> Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire,
<i>Principes de Phil. Zoologique discutés en</i> 1830, p. 55.</div>
<p>But still, though this organization, in the abundance and diversity
of its parts, approaches that of vertebrate animals, it had not been
considered as composed in the same manner, or arranged in the same
order, Cuvier had always maintained that the plan of molluscs is not a
continuation of the plan of vertebrates. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page485">485</a></span></p>
<p>MM. Laurencet and Meyranx, on the contrary, conceived that the
sepia might be reduced to the type of a vertebrate creature, by
considering the back-bone of the latter bent double backwards, so as
to bring the root of the tail to the nape of the neck; the parts thus
brought into contact being supposed to coalesce. By this mode of
conception, these anatomists held that the viscera were placed in the
same connexion as in the vertebrate type, and the functions exercised
in an analogous manner.</p>
<p>To decide on the reality of the analogy thus asserted, clearly
belonged to the jurisdiction of the most eminent anatomists and
physiologists. The Memoir was committed to Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and
Latreille, two eminent zoologists, in order to be reported on. Their
report was extremely favorable; and went almost to the length of
adopting the views of the authors.</p>
<p>Cuvier expressed some dissatisfaction with this report on its being
read;<a id="fnanchor110-17" href="#note110-17"><span
class="fnanchor">110</span></a> and a short time afterwards,<a
id="fnanchor111-17" href="#note111-17"><span
class="fnanchor">111</span></a> represented Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire as
having asserted that the new views of Laurencet and Meyranx refuted
completely the notion of the great interval which exists between
molluscous and vertebrate animals. Geoffroy protested against such an
interpretation of his expressions; but it soon appeared, by the
controversial character which the discussions on this and several
other subjects assumed, that a real opposition of opinions was in
action.</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note111-17"
href="#fnanchor111-17">111</a></span> p. 50.</div>
<p>Without attempting to explain the exact views of Geoffroy, (we may,
perhaps, venture to say that they are hardly yet generally understood
with sufficient distinctness to justify the mere historian of science
in attempting such an explanation,) their general tendency may be
sufficiently collected from what has been said; and from the phrases
in which his views are conveyed.<a id="fnanchor112-17"
href="#note112-17"><span class="fnanchor">112</span></a> <i>The
principle of connexions, the elective affinities of organic elements,
the equilibrization of organs</i>;&#8212;such are the designations of
the leading doctrines which are unfolded in the preliminary discourse
of his <i>Anatomical Philosophy</i>. Elective affinities of organic
elements are the forces by which the vital structures and varied forms
of living things are produced; and the principles of connexion and
equilibrium of these forces in the various parts of the organization
prescribe limits and conditions to the variety and developement of
such forms.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note112-17"
href="#fnanchor112-17">112</a></span> <i>Phil. Zool.</i> 15.</div>
<p>The character and tendency of this philosophy will be, I think,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page486">486</a></span> much more
clear, if we consider what it excludes and denies. It rejects
altogether all conception of a plan and purpose in the organs of
animals, as a principle which has determined their forms, or can be of
use in directing our reasonings. “I take care,” says Geoffroy, “not to
ascribe to God any intention.”<a id="fnanchor113-17"
href="#note113-17"><span class="fnanchor">113</span></a> And when
Cuvier speaks of the combination of organs in such order that they may
be in consistence with the part which the animal <em>has to play</em>
in nature; his rival rejoins,<a id="fnanchor114-17"
href="#note114-17"><span class="fnanchor">114</span></a> I “know
nothing of animals which <em>have to play</em> a part in nature.” Such
a notion is, he holds, unphilosophical and dangerous. It is an abuse
of final causes which makes the cause to be engendered by the effect.
And to illustrate still further his own view, he says, “I have read concerning
fishes, that because they live in a medium which resists more than
air, their motive forces are calculated so as to give them the power
of progression under those circumstances. By this mode of reasoning,
you would say of a man who makes use of crutches, that he was
originally destined to the misfortune of having a leg paralysed or
amputated.”</p>

<p>How far this doctrine of unity in the plan in animals, is
admissible or probable in physiology when kept within proper limits,
that is, when not put in opposition to the doctrine of a purpose
involved in the plan of animals, I do not pretend even to conjecture.
The question is one which appears to be at present deeply occupying
the minds of the most learned and profound physiologists; and such
persons alone, adding to their knowledge and zeal, judicial sagacity
and impartiality, can tell us what is the general tendency of the best
researches on this subject.<a id="fnanchor115-17"
href="#note115-17"><span class="fnanchor">115</span></a> But when the
anatomist expresses such opinions, and defends them by such
illustrations as those which I have just quoted,<a id="fnanchor116-17"
href="#note116-17"><span class="fnanchor">116</span></a> we perceive
that he quits the entrenchments of his superior science, in which he
might <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page487">487</a></span> have
remained unassailable so long as the question was a professional one;
and the discussion is open to those who possess no peculiar knowledge
of anatomy. We shall, therefore, venture to say a few words upon
it.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note115-17"
href="#fnanchor115-17">115</a></span> So far as this doctrine is
generally accepted among the best physiologists, we cannot doubt the
propriety of Meckel’s remark, (<i>Comparative Anatomy</i>, 1821, Pref.
p. xi.) that it cannot be truly asserted either to be new, or to be
peculiarly due to Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note116-17"
href="#fnanchor116-17">116</a></span> It is hardly worth while
answering such illustrations, but I may remark, that the one quoted
above, irrelevant and unbecoming as it is, tells altogether against
its author. The fact that the wooden leg is of the same length as the
other, proves, and would satisfy the most incredulous man, that it was
<em>intended</em> for walking.</div>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Estimate of the Doctrine of Unity of
Plan.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">It</span> has been so often
repeated, and so generally allowed in modern times, that Final Causes
ought not to be made our guides in natural philosophy, that a
prejudice has been established against the introduction of any views
to which this designation can be applied, into physical speculations.
Yet, in fact, the assumption of an end or purpose in the structure of
organized beings, appears to be an intellectual habit which no efforts
can cast off. It has prevailed from the earliest to the latest ages of
zoological research; appears to be fastened upon us alike by our
ignorance and our knowledge; and has been formally accepted by so many
great anatomists, that we cannot feel any scruple in believing the
rejection of it to be the superstition of a false philosophy, and a
result of the exaggeration of other principles which are supposed
capable of superseding its use. And the doctrine of unity of plan of
all animals, and the other principles associated with this doctrine,
so far as they exclude the conviction of an intelligible scheme and a
discoverable end, in the organization of animals, appear to be utterly
erroneous. I will offer a few reasons for an opinion which may appear
presumptuous in a writer who has only a general knowledge of the
subject.</p>
<p>1. In the first place, it appears to me that the argumentation on
the case in question, the Sepia, does by no means turn out to the
advantage of the new hypothesis. The arguments in support of the
hypothetical view of the structure of this mollusc were, that by this
view the relative position of the parts was explained, and
confirmations which had appeared altogether anomalous, were reduced to
rule; for example, the beak, which had been supposed to be in a
position the reverse of all other beaks, was shown, by the assumed
posture, to have its upper mandible longer than the lower, and thus to
be regularly placed. “But,” says Cuvier,<a id="fnanchor117-17"
href="#note117-17"><span class="fnanchor">117</span></a> “supposing
the posture, in order that the side on which the funnel of the sepia
is folded should be the back of the animal, considered as similar to a
vertebrate, the brain with <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page488">488</a></span> regard to the beak, and the œsophagus
with regard to the liver, should have positions corresponding to those
in vertebrates; but the positions of these organs are exactly contrary
to the hypothesis. How, then, can you say,” he asks, “that the
cephalopods and vertebrates have <i>identity of composition</i>,
<i>unity of composition</i>, without using words in a sense entirely
different from their common meaning?”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note117-17"
href="#fnanchor117-17">117</a></span> <i>G. S. H. Phil. Zool.</i> p.
70.</div>
<p>This argument appears to be exactly of the kind on which the value
of the hypothesis must depend.<a id="fnanchor118-17"
href="#note118-17"><span class="fnanchor">118</span></a> It is,
therefore, interesting to see the reply made to it by the theorist. It
is this: “I admit the facts here stated, but I deny that they lead to
the notion of a different sort of animal composition. Molluscous
animals had been placed too high in the zoological scale; but if they
are only the embryos of its lower stages, if they are only beings in
which far fewer organs come into play, it does not follow that the
organs are destitute of the relations which the power of successive
generations may demand. The organ A will be in an unusual relation
with the organ C, if B has not been produced;&#8212;if a stoppage of
the developement has fallen upon this latter organ, and has thus
prevented its production. And thus,” he says, “we see how we may have
different arrangements, and divers constructions as they appear to the
eye.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note118-17"
href="#fnanchor118-17">118</a></span> I do not dwell on other
arguments which were employed. It was given as a circumstance
suggesting the supposed posture of the type, that in this way the back
was colored, and the belly was white. On this Cuvier observes
(<i>Phil. Zool.</i> pp. 93, 68), “I must say, that I do not know any
naturalist so ignorant as to suppose that the back is determined by
its dark color, or even by its position when the animal is in motion;
they all know that the badger has a black belly and a white back; that
an infinity of other animals, especially among insects, are in the
same case; and that many fishes swim on their side, or with their
belly upwards.”</div>
<p>It seems to me that such a concession as this entirely destroys the
theory which it attempts to defend; for what arrangement does the
principle of unity of composition <em>exclude</em>, if it admits
unusual, that is, various arrangements of some organs, accompanied by
the total absence of others? Or how does this differ from Cuvier’s
mode of stating the conclusion, except in the introduction of certain
arbitrary hypotheses of developement and stoppage? “I reduce the
facts,” Cuvier says, “to their true expression, by saying that
Cephalopods have several organs which are common to them and
vertebrates, and which discharge the same offices; but that these
organs are in them differently distributed, and often constructed in a
different manner; <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page489">489</a></span> and they are accompanied by several
other organs which vertebrates have not; while these on the other hand
have several which are wanting in cephalopods.”</p>
<p>We shall see afterwards the general principles which Cuvier himself
considered as the best guides in these reasonings. But I will first
add a few words on the disposition of the school now under
consideration, to reject all assumption of an end.</p>
<p>2. That the parts of the bodies of animals are made in order to
discharge their respective offices, is a conviction which we cannot
believe to be otherwise than an irremovable principle of the
philosophy of organization, when we see the manner in which it has
constantly forced itself upon the minds of zoologists and anatomists
in all ages; not only as an inference, but as a guide whose
indications they could not help following. I have already noticed
expressions of this conviction in some of the principal persons who
occur in the history of physiology, as Galen and Harvey. I might add
many more, but I will content myself with adducing a contemporary of
Geoffroy’s whose testimony is the more remarkable, because he
obviously shares with his countryman in the common prejudice against
the use of final causes. “I consider,” he says, in speaking of the
provisions for the reproduction of animals,<a id="fnanchor119-17"
href="#note119-17"><span class="fnanchor">119</span></a> “with the
great Bacon, the philosophy of final causes as sterile; but I have
elsewhere acknowledged that it was very difficult for the most
cautious man never to have recourse to them in his explanations.”
After the survey which we have had to take of the history of
physiology, we cannot but see that the assumption of final causes in
this branch of science is so far from being sterile, that it has had a
large share in every discovery which is included in the existing mass
of real knowledge. The use of every organ has been discovered by
starting from the assumption that it must have <em>some</em> use. The
doctrine of the circulation of the blood was, as we have seen, clearly
and professedly due to the persuasion of a purpose in the circulatory
apparatus. The study of comparative anatomy is the study of the
adaption of animal structures to their purposes. And we shall soon
have to show that this conception of final causes has, in our own
times, been so far from barren, that it has, in the hands of Cuvier
and others, enabled us to become intimately acquainted with vast
departments of zoology to which we have no other mode of access. It
has placed before us in a complete state, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page490">490</a></span> animals, of which, for thousands of
years, only a few fragments have existed, and which differ widely from
all existing animals; and it has given birth, or at least has given
the greatest part of its importance and interest, to a science which
forms one of the brightest parts of the modern progress of knowledge.
It is, therefore, very far from being a vague and empty assertion,
when we say that final causes are a real and indestructible element in
zoological philosophy; and that the exclusion of them, as attempted by
the school of which we speak, is a fundamental and most mischievous
error.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note119-17"

et du Morale de l’Homme</i>, i. <span class="correction"
title="emended from 229">299</span>.</div>
<p>3. Thus, though the physiologist may persuade himself that he ought
not to refer to final causes, we find that, practically, he cannot
help doing this; and that the event shows that his practical habit is
right and well-founded. But he may still cling to the speculative
difficulties and doubts in which such subjects may be involved by <i>à
priori</i> considerations. He may say, as Saint-Hilaire does say,<a
id="fnanchor120-17" href="#note120-17"><span
class="fnanchor">120</span></a> “I ascribe no intention to God, for I
mistrust the feeble powers of my reason. I observe facts merely, and
go no further. I only pretend to the character of the historian of
<em>what is</em>.” “I cannot make Nature an intelligent being who does
nothing in vain, who acts by the shortest mode, who does all for the
best.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note120-17"
href="#fnanchor120-17">120</a></span> <i>Phil. Zool.</i> p. 10.</div>
<p>I am not going to enter at any length into this subject, which,
thus considered, is metaphysical and theological, rather than
physiological. If any one maintain, as some have maintained, that no
manifestation of means apparently used for ends in nature, can prove
the existence of design in the Author of nature, this is not the place
to refute such an opinion in its general form. But I think it may be
worth while to show, that even those who incline to such an opinion,
still cannot resist the necessity which compels men to assume, in
organized beings, the existence of an end.</p>
<p>Among the philosophers who have referred our conviction of the
being of God to our moral nature, and have denied the possibility of
demonstration on mere physical grounds, Kant is perhaps the most
eminent. Yet he has asserted the reality of such a principle of
physiology as we are now maintaining in the most emphatic manner.
Indeed, this assumption of an end makes his very definition of an
organized being. “An organized product of nature is that in which all
the parts are mutually ends and means.”<a id="fnanchor121-17"
href="#note121-17"><span class="fnanchor">121</span></a> And this, he
says, is a universal and necessary maxim. He adds, “It is well known
that the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page491">491</a></span>
anatomizers of plants and animals, in order to investigate their
structure, and to obtain an insight into the grounds why and to what
end such parts, why such a situation and connexion of the parts, and
exactly such an internal form, come before them, assume, as
indispensably necessary, this maxim, that in such a creature nothing
is <em>in vain</em>, and proceed upon it in the same way in which in
general natural philosophy we proceed upon the principle that
<em>nothing happens by chance</em>. In fact, they can as little free
themselves from this <i>teleological</i> principle as from the general
physical one; for as, on omitting the latter, no experience would be
possible, so on omitting the former principle, no clue could exist for
the observation of a kind of natural objects which can be considered
teleologically under the conception of natural ends.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note121-17"
href="#fnanchor121-17">121</a></span> <i>Urtheilskraft</i>, p.
296.</div>
<p>Even if the reader should not follow the reasoning of this
celebrated philosopher, he will still have no difficulty in seeing
that he asserts, in the most distinct manner, that which is denied by
the author whom we have before quoted, the propriety and necessity of
assuming the existence of an end as our guide in the study of animal
organization.</p>
<p>4. It appears to me, therefore, that whether we judge from the
arguments, the results, the practice of physiologists, their
speculative opinions, or those of the philosophers of a wider field,
we are led to the same conviction, that in the organized world we may
and must adopt the belief that organization exists for its purpose,
and that the apprehension of the purpose may guide us in seeing the
meaning of the organization. And I now proceed to show how this
principle has been brought into additional clearness and use by
Cuvier.</p>
<p>In doing this, I may, perhaps, be allowed to make a reflection of a
kind somewhat different from the preceding remarks, though suggested
by them. In another work,<a id="fnanchor122-17"
href="#note122-17"><span class="fnanchor">122</span></a> I endeavored
to show that those who have been discoverers in science have generally
had minds, the disposition of which was to believe in an intelligent
Maker of the universe; and that the scientific speculations which
produced an opposite tendency, were generally those which, though they
might deal familiarly with known physical truths, and conjecture
boldly with regard to the unknown, did not add to the number of solid
generalizations. In order to judge whether this remark is distinctly
applicable in the case now considered, I should have to estimate
Cuvier in comparison with other physiologists of his time, which I do
not presume to do. But I may <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page492">492</a></span> observe, that he is allowed by all to
have established, on an indestructible basis, many of the most
important generalizations which zoology now contains; and the
principal defect which his critics have pointed out, has been, that he
did not generalize still more widely and boldly. It appears,
therefore, that he cannot but be placed among the great discoverers in
the studies which he pursued; and this being the case, those who look
with pleasure on the tendency of the thoughts of the greatest men to
an Intelligence far higher than their own, most be gratified to find
that he was an example of this tendency; and that the acknowledgement
of a creative purpose, as well as a creative power, not only entered
into his belief but made an indispensable and prominent part of his
philosophy.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">We</span> have now to describe more
in detail the doctrine which Cuvier maintained in opposition to such
opinions as we have been speaking of; and which, in his way of
applying it, we look upon as a material advance in physiological
knowledge, and therefore give to it a distinct place in our history.
“Zoology has,” he says,<a id="fnanchor123-17" href="#note123-17"><span
class="fnanchor">123</span></a> in the outset of his <i>Règne
Animal</i>, “a principle of reasoning which is peculiar to it, and
which it employs with advantage on many occasions: this is the
principle of <i>the Conditions of Existence</i>, vulgarly the
principle of <i>Final Causes</i>. As nothing can exist if it do not
combine all the conditions which render its existence possible, the
different parts of each being must be co-ordinated in such a manner as
to render the total being possible, not only in itself, but in its
relations to those which surround it; and the analysis of these
conditions often leads to general laws, as clearly demonstrated as
those which result from calculation or from experience.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note123-17"
href="#fnanchor123-17">123</a></span> <i>Règne An.</i> p. 6.</div>
<p>This is the enunciation of his leading principle in general terms.
To our ascribing it to him, some may object on the ground of its being
self-evident in its nature,<a id="fnanchor124-17"
href="#note124-17"><span class="fnanchor">124</span></a> and having
been very anciently applied. But to this we reply, that the principle
must be considered as a real discovery in the hands of him who first
shows how to make it an instrument of other discoveries. It is true,
in other cases as well as in this, that some vague apprehension, of
true general principles, such as <i>à</i> <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page493">493</a></span> <i>priori</i> considerations can supply,
has long preceded the knowledge of them as real and verified laws. In
such a way it was seen, before Newton, that the motions of the planets
must result from attraction; and so, before Dufay and Franklin, it was
held that electrical actions must result from a fluid. Cuvier’s merit
consisted, not in seeing that an animal cannot exist without combining
all the conditions of its existence; but in perceiving that this truth
may be taken as a guide in our researches concerning
animals;&#8212;that the mode of their existence may be collected from
one part of their structure, and then applied to interpret or detect
another part. He went on the supposition not only that animal forms
have <em>some</em> plan, <em>some</em> purpose, but that they have an
intelligible plan, a discoverable purpose. He proceeded in his
investigations like the decipherer of a manuscript, who makes out his
alphabet from one part of the context, and then applies it to read the
rest. The proof that his principle was something very different from
an identical proposition, is to be found in the fact, that it enabled
him to understand and arrange the structures of animals with
unprecedented clearness and completeness of order; and to restore the
forms of the extinct animals which are found in the rocks of the
earth, in a manner which has been universally assented to as
irresistibly convincing. These results cannot flow from a trifling or
barren principle; and they show us that if we are disposed to form
such a judgment of Cuvier’s doctrine, it must be because we do not
fully apprehend its import.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note124-17"
href="#fnanchor124-17">124</a></span> Swainson. <i>Study of Nat.
Hist.</i> p. 85.</div>
<p>To illustrate this, we need only quote the statement which he
makes, and the uses to which he applies it. Thus in the Introduction
to his great work on <i>Fossil Remains</i> he says, “Every organized
being forms an entire system of its own, all the parts of which
mutually correspond, and concur to produce a certain definite purpose
by reciprocal reaction, or by combining to the same end. Hence none of
these separate parts can change their forms without a corresponding
change in the other parts of the same animal; and consequently each of
these parts, taken separately, indicates all the other parts to which
it has belonged. Thus, if the viscera of an animal are so organized as
only to be fitted for the digestion of recent flesh, it is also
requisite that the jaws should be so constructed as to fit them for
devouring prey; the claws must be constructed for seizing it and
tearing it to pieces; the teeth for cutting and dividing its flesh;
the entire system of the limbs or organs of motion for pursuing and
overtaking it; and the organs of sense for discovering it at a
distance. Nature must also have endowed the brain of the animal with
instincts sufficient for concealing itself and for laying plans to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page494">494</a></span> catch its
necessary victims.”<a id="fnanchor125-17" href="#note125-17"><span
class="fnanchor">125</span></a> By such considerations he has been
able to reconstruct the whole of many animals of which parts only were
given;&#8212;a positive result, which shows both the reality and the
value of the truth on which he wrought.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note125-17"
href="#fnanchor125-17">125</a></span> <i>Theory of the Earth</i>, p.
90.</div>
<p>Another great example, equally showing the immense importance of
this principle in Cuvier’s hands, is the reform which, by means of it,
he introduced into the classification of animals. Here again we may
quote the view he himself has given<a id="fnanchor126-17"
href="#note126-17"><span class="fnanchor">126</span></a> of the
character of his own improvements. In studying the physiology of the
natural classes of vertebrate animals, he found, he says, “in the
respective quantity of their respiration, the reason of the quantity
of their motion, and consequently of the kind of locomotion. This,
again, furnishes the reason for the forms of their skeletons and
muscles; and the energy of their senses, and the force of their
digestion, are in a necessary proportion to the same quantity. Thus a
division which had till then been established, like that of
vegetables, only upon observation, was found to rest upon causes
appreciable, and applicable to other cases.” Accordingly, he applied
this view to invertebrates;&#8212;examined the modifications which
take place in their organs of circulation, respiration, and sensation;
and having calculated the necessary results of these modifications, he
deduced from it a new division of those animals, in which they are
arranged according to their true relations.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note126-17"
href="#fnanchor126-17">126</a></span> <i>Hist. Sc. Nat.</i> i.
293.</div>
<p>Such have been some of the results of the principle of the
Conditions of Existence, as applied by its great assertor.</p>
<p>It is clear, indeed, that such a principle could acquire its
practical value only in the hands of a person intimately acquainted
with anatomical details, with the functions of the organs, and with
their variety in different animals. It is only by means of such
nutriment that the embryo truth could be developed into a vast tree of
science. But it is not the less clear, that Cuvier’s immense knowledge
and great powers of thought led to their results, only by being
employed under the guidance of this master-principle: and, therefore,
we may justly consider it as the distinctive feature of his
speculations, and follow it with a gratified eye, as the thread of
gold which runs through, connects, and enriches his zoological
researches:&#8212;gives them a deeper interest and a higher value than
can belong to any view of the organical sciences, in which the very
essence of organization is kept out of sight. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page495">495</a></span></p>
<p>The real philosopher, who knows that all the kinds of truth are
intimately connected, and that all the best hopes and encouragements
which are granted to our nature must be consistent with truth, will be
satisfied and confirmed, rather than surprised and disturbed, thus to
find the Natural Sciences leading him to the borders of a higher
region. To him it will appear natural and reasonable, that after
journeying so long among the beautiful and orderly laws by which the
universe is governed, we find ourselves at last approaching to a
Source of order and law, and intellectual beauty:&#8212;that, after
venturing into the region of life and feeling and will, we are led to
believe the Fountain of life and will not to be itself unintelligent
and dead, but to be a living Mind, a Power which aims as well as acts.
To us this doctrine appears like the natural cadence of the tones to
which we have so long been listening; and without such a final strain
our ears would have been left craving and unsatisfied. We have been
lingering long amid the harmonies of law and symmetry, constancy and
development; and these notes, though their music was sweet and deep,
must too often have sounded to the ear of our moral nature, as vague
and unmeaning melodies, floating in the air around us, but conveying
no definite thought, moulded into no intelligible announcement. But
one passage which we have again and again caught by snatches, though
sometimes interrupted and lost, at last swells in our ears full,
clear, and decided; and the religious “Hymn in honor of the Creator,”
to which Galen so gladly lent his voice, and in which the best
physiologists of succeeding times have ever joined, is filled into a
richer and deeper harmony by the greatest philosophers of these later
days, and will roll on hereafter the “perpetual song” of the temple of
science.</p>

<h3 class="space-above">INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Of the Palætiological Sciences.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">WE</span> now approach the last Class
of Sciences which enter into the design of the present work; and of
these, Geology is the representative, whose history we shall therefore
briefly follow. By the Class of Sciences to which I have referred it,
I mean to point out those researches in which the object is, to ascend
from the present state of things to a more ancient condition, from
which the present is derived by intelligible causes.</p>
<p>The sciences which treat of causes have sometimes been termed
<i>ætiological</i>, from αἰτία, <i>a cause</i>: but this term would
not sufficiently describe the speculations of which we now speak;
since it might include sciences which treat of Permanent Causality,
like Mechanics, as well as inquiries concerning Progressive Causation.
The investigations which I now wish to group together, deal, not only
with the possible, but with the actual past; and a portion of that
science on which we are about to enter, Geology, has properly been
termed <i>Palæontology</i>, since it treats of beings which formerly
existed.<a id="fnanchor1-18" href="#note1-18"><span
class="fnanchor">1</span></a> Hence, combining these two notions,<a
id="fnanchor2-18" href="#note2-18"><span class="fnanchor">2</span></a>
<i>Palætiology</i> appears to be a term not inappropriate, to describe
those speculations which thus refer to actual past events, and attempt
to explain them by laws of causation.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note1-18"
href="#fnanchor1-18">1</a></span> Πάλαι, ὄντα</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note2-18"
href="#fnanchor2-18">2</a></span> Πάλαι, αἰτία</div>
<p>Such speculations are not confined to the world of inert matter; we
have examples of them in inquiries concerning the monuments of the art
and labor of distant ages; in examinations into the origin and early
progress of states and cities, customs and languages; as well as in
researches concerning the causes and formations of mountains and
rocks, the imbedding of fossils in strata, and their elevation from
the bottom of the ocean. All these speculations are connected by this
bond,&#8212;that they endeavor to ascend to a past state of things, by
the aid of the evidence of the present. In asserting, with Cuvier,
that <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page500">500</a></span> “The
geologist is an antiquary of a new order,” we do not mark a fanciful
and superficial resemblance of employment merely, but a real and
philosophical connexion of the principles of investigation. The
organic fossils which occur in the rock, and the medals which we find
in the ruins of ancient cities, are to be studied in a similar spirit
and for a similar purpose. Indeed, it is not always easy to know where
the task of the geologist ends, and that of the antiquary begins. The
study of ancient geography may involve us in the examination of the
causes by which the forms of coasts and plains are changed; the
ancient mound or scarped rock may force upon us the problem, whether
its form is the work of nature or of man; the ruined temple may
exhibit the traces of time in its changed level, and sea-worn columns;
and thus the antiquarian of the earth may be brought into the very
middle of the domain belonging to the antiquarian of art.</p>
<p>Such a union of these different kinds of archæological
investigations has, in fact, repeatedly occurred. The changes which
have taken place in the temple of Jupiter Serapis, near Puzzuoli, are
of the sort which have just been described; and this is only one
example of a large class of objects;&#8212;the monuments of art
converted into records of natural events. And on a wider scale, we
find Cuvier, in his inquiries into geological changes, bringing
together historical and physical evidence. Dr. Prichard, in his
<i>Researches into the Physical History of Man</i>, has shown that to
execute such a design as his, we must combine the knowledge of the
physiological laws of nature with the traditions of history and the
philosophical comparison of languages. And even if we refuse to admit,
as part of the business of geology, inquiries concerning the origin
and physical history of the present population of the globe; still the
geologist is compelled to take an interest in such inquiries, in order
to understand matters which rigorously belong to his proper domain;
for the ascertained history of the present state of things offers the
best means of throwing light upon the causes of <em>past</em> changes.
Mr. Lyell quotes Dr. Prichard’s book more frequently than any
geological work of the same extent.</p>
<p>Again, we may notice another common circumstance in the studies
which we are grouping together as palætiological, diverse as they are
in their subjects. In all of them we have the same kind of
manifestations of a number of successive changes, each springing out
of a preceding state; and in all, the phenomena at each step become
more and more complicated, by involving the results of all that has
preceded, modified by supervening agencies. The general aspect of all
these <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page501">501</a></span> trains of
change is similar, and offers the same features for description. The
relics and ruins of the earlier states are preserved, mutilated and
dead, in the products of later times. The analogical figures by which
we are tempted to express this relation are philosophically true. It
is more than a mere fanciful description, to say that in languages,
customs, forms of Society, political institutions, we see a number of
formations super-imposed upon one another, each of which is, for the
most part, an assemblage of fragments and results of the preceding
condition. Though our comparison might be bold, it would be just, if
we were to assert, that the English language is a conglomerate of
Latin words, bound together in a Saxon cement; the fragments of the
Latin being partly portions introduced directly from the parent
quarry, with all their sharp edges, and partly pebbles of the same
material, obscured and shaped by long rolling in a Norman or some
other channel. Thus the study of palætiology in the materials of the
earth, is only a type of similar studies with respect to all the
elements, which, in the history of the earth’s inhabitants, have been
constantly undergoing a series of connected changes.</p>
<p>But, wide as is the view which such considerations give us of the
class of sciences to which geology belongs, they extend still further.
“The science of the changes which have taken place in the organic
kingdoms of nature,” (such is the description which has been given of
Geology,<a id="fnanchor3-18" href="#note3-18"><span
class="fnanchor">3</span></a>) may, by following another set of
connexions, be extended beyond “the modifications of the surface of
our own planet.” For we cannot doubt that some resemblance of a closer
or looser kind, has obtained between the changes and causes of change,
on other bodies of the universe, and on our own. The appearances of
something of the kind of volcanic action on the surface of the moon,
are not to be mistaken. And the inquiries concerning the origin of our
planet and of our solar system, inquiries to which Geology
irresistibly impels her students, direct us to ask what information
the rest of the universe can supply, bearing upon this subject. It has
been thought by some, that we can trace systems, more or less like our
solar system, in the process of formation; the nebulous matter, which
is at first expansive and attenuated, condensing gradually into suns
and planets. Whether this <i>Nebular Hypothesis</i> be tenable or not,
I shall not here inquire; but the discussion of such a question would
be closely connected with <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page502">502</a></span> geology, both in its interests and in
its methods. If men are ever able to frame a science of the past
changes by which the universe has been brought into its present
condition, this science will be properly described as <i>Cosmical
Palætiology</i>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note3-18"
href="#fnanchor3-18">3</a></span> Lyell, <i>Principles of Geology</i>,
p. 1.</div>
<p>These palætiological sciences might properly be called
<i>historical</i>, if that term were sufficiently precise: for they
are all of the nature of history, being concerned with the succession
of events: and the part of history which deals with the past causes of
events, is, in fact, a moral palætiology. But the phrase <i>Natural
History</i> has so accustomed us to a use of the word <i>history</i>
in which we have nothing to do with time, that, if we were to employ
the word <i>historical</i> to describe the palætiological sciences, it
would be in constant danger of being misunderstood. The fact is, as
Mohs has said, that Natural History, when systematically treated,
rigorously excludes all that is <i>historical</i>; for it classes
objects by their permanent and universal properties, and has nothing
to do with the narration of particular and casual facts. And this is
an inconsistency which we shall not attempt to rectify.</p>
<p>All palætiological sciences, since they undertake to refer changes
to their causes, assume a certain classification of the phenomena
which change brings forth, and a knowledge of the operation of the
causes of change. These phenomena, these causes, are very different,
in the branches of knowledge which I have thus classed together. The
natural features of the earth’s surface, the works of art, the
institutions of society, the forms of language, taken together, are
undoubtedly a very wide collection of subjects of speculation; and the
kinds of causation which apply to them are no less varied. Of the
causes of change in the inorganic and organic world,&#8212;the
peculiar principles of Geology&#8212;we shall hereafter have to speak.
As these must be studied by the geologist, so, in like manner, the
tendencies, instincts, faculties, principles, which direct man to
architecture and sculpture, to civil government, to rational and
grammatical speech, and which have determined the circumstances of his
progress in these paths, must be in a great degree known to the
Palætiologist of Art, of Society, and of Language, respectively, in
order that he may speculate soundly upon his peculiar subject. With
these matters we shall not here meddle, confining ourselves, in our
exemplification of the conditions and progress of such sciences, to
the case of Geology.</p>
<p>The journey of survey which we have attempted to perform over the
field of human knowledge, although carefully directed according to the
paths and divisions of the physical sciences, has already <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page503">503</a></span> conducted us to the
boundaries of physical science, and gives us a glimpse of the region
beyond. In following the history of Life, we found ourselves led to
notice the perceptive and active faculties of man; it appeared that
there was a ready passage from physiology to psychology, from physics
to metaphysics. In the class of sciences now under notice, we are, at
a different point, carried from the world of matter to the world of
thought and feeling,&#8212;from things to men. For, as we have already
said, the science of the causes of change includes the productions of
Man as well as of Nature. The history of the earth, and the history of
the earth’s inhabitants, as collected from phenomena, are governed by
the same principles. Thus the portions of knowledge which seek to
travel back towards the origin, whether of inert things or of the
works of man, resemble each other. Both of them treat of events as
connected by the thread of time and causation. In both we endeavor to
learn accurately what the present is, and hence what the past has
been. Both are <em>historical</em> sciences in the same sense.</p>
<p>It must be recollected that I am now speaking of history as
ætiological;&#8212;as it investigates causes, and as it does this in a
scientific, that is, in a rigorous and systematic, manner. And I may
observe here, though I cannot now dwell on the subject, that all
ætiological sciences will consist of three portions; the Description
of the facts and phenomena;&#8212;the general Theory of the causes of
change appropriate to the case;&#8212;and the Application of the
theory to the facts. Thus, taking Geology for our example, we must
have, first <i>Descriptive</i> or <i>Phenomenal</i> Geology; next, the
exposition of the general principles by which such phenomena can be
produced, which we may term <i>Geological Dynamics</i>; and, lastly,
doctrines hence derived, as to what have been the causes of the
existing state of things, which we may call <i>Physical
Geology</i>.</p>
<p>These three branches of geology may be found frequently or
constantly combined in the works of writers on the subject, and it may
not always be easy to discriminate exactly what belongs to each
subject.<a id="fnanchor4-18" href="#note4-18"><span
class="fnanchor">4</span></a> But the analogy of this science with
others, its present <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page504">504</a></span> condition and future fortunes, will
derive great illustration from such a distribution of its history; and
in this point of view, therefore, we shall briefly treat of it;
dividing the history of Geological Dynamics, for the sake of
convenience, into two Chapters, one referring to inorganic, and one to
organic, phenomena.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note4-18"
href="#fnanchor4-18">4</a></span> The Wernerians, in distinguishing
their study from <i>Geology</i>, and designating it as
<i>Geognosy</i>, the <i>knowledge</i> of the earth, appear to have
intended to select Descriptive Geology for their peculiar field. In
like manner, the original aim of the Geological Society of London,
which was formed (1807) “with a view to record and multiply
observations,” recognized the possibility of a Descriptive Geology
separate from the other portions of the science.</div>

Geological Facts.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> recent history of Geology,
as to its most important points, is bound up with what is doing at
present from day to day; and that portion of the history of the
science which belongs to the past, has been amply treated by other
writers.<a id="fnanchor5-18" href="#note5-18"><span
class="fnanchor">5</span></a> I shall, therefore, pass rapidly over
the series of events of which this history consists; and shall only
attempt to mention what may seem to illustrate and confirm my own view
of its state and principles.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note5-18"
href="#fnanchor5-18">5</a></span> As MM. Lyell, Fitton, Conybeare, in
our own country.</div>
<p>Agreeably to the order already pointed out, I shall notice, in the
first place, Phenomenal Geology, or the description of the facts, as
distinct from the inquiry into their causes. It is manifest that such
a merely descriptive kind of knowledge may exist; and it probably will
not be contested, that such knowledge ought to be collected, before we
attempt to frame theories concerning the causes of the phenomena. But
it must be observed, that we are here speaking of the formation of a
<em>science</em>; and that it is not a collection of miscellaneous,
unconnected, unarranged knowledge that can be considered as
constituting science; but a methodical, coherent, and, as far as
possible, complete body of facts, exhibiting fully the condition of
the earth as regards those circumstances which are the subject matter
of geological speculation. Such a Descriptive Geology is a
pre-requisite to Physical Geology, just as Phenomenal Astronomy
necessarily preceded Physical Astronomy, or as Classificatory Botany
is a necessary accompaniment to Botanical Physiology. We may observe
also that Descriptive Geology, such as we now speak of, is one of the
classificatory sciences, like <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page506">506</a></span> Mineralogy or Botany: and will be found
to exhibit some of the features of that class of sciences.</p>
<p>Since, then, our History of Descriptive Geology is to include only
systematic and scientific descriptions of the earth or portions of it,
we pass over, at once, all the casual and insulated statements of
facts, though they may be geological facts, which occur in early
writers; such, for instance, as the remark of Herodotus,<a
id="fnanchor6-18" href="#note6-18"><span class="fnanchor">6</span></a>
that there are shells in the mountains of Egypt; or the general
statements which Ovid puts in the mouth of Pythagoras:<a

class="fnanchor">7</span></a></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>We may remark here already how generally there are mingled with
descriptive notices of such geological facts, speculations concerning
their causes. Herodotus refers to the circumstance just quoted, for
the purpose of showing that Egypt was formerly a gulf of the sea; and
the passage of the Roman poet is part of a series of exemplifications
which he gives of the philosophical tenet, that nothing perishes but
everything changes. It will be only by constant attention that we
shall be able to keep our provinces of geology distinct.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Early Descriptions and Collections of
Fossils.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">If</span> we look, as we have
proposed to do, for systematic and exact knowledge of geological
facts, we find nothing which we can properly adduce till we come to
modern times. But when facts such as those already mentioned, (that
sea-shells and other marine objects are found imbedded in rocks,) and
other circumstances in the structure of the Earth, had attracted
considerable attention, the exact examination, collection, and record
of these circumstances began to be attempted. Among such steps in
Descriptive Geology, we may notice descriptions and pictures of
fossils, descriptions of veins and mines, collections of organic and
inorganic fossils, maps of the mineral structure of countries, and
finally, the discoveries concerning the superposition of strata, the
constancy of their organic contents, their correspondence in different
countries, and such great general relations of the materials and
features of the earth as have been discovered up to the present time.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page507">507</a></span> Without
attempting to assign to every important advance its author, I shall
briefly exemplify each of the modes of contributing to descriptive
geology which I have just enumerated.</p>
<p>The study of organic fossils was first pursued with connexion and
system in Italy. The hills which on each side skirt the mountain-range
of the Apennines are singularly rich in remains of marine animals.
When these remarkable objects drew the attention of thoughtful men,
controversies soon arose whether they really were the remains of
living creatures, or the productions of some capricious or mysterious
power by which the forms of such creatures were mimicked; and again,
if the shells were really the spoils of the sea, whether they had been
carried to the hills by the deluge of which the Scripture speaks, or
whether they indicated revolutions of the earth of a different kind.
The earlier works which contain the descriptions of the phenomena
have, in almost all instances, by far the greater part of their pages
occupied with these speculations; indeed, the facts could not be
studied without leading to such inferences, and would not have been
collected but for the interest which such reasonings possessed. As one
of the first persons who applied a sound and vigorous intellect to
these subjects, we may notice the celebrated painter Leonardo da
Vinci, whom we have <a href="#v1page318">already</a> had to refer to
as one of the founders of the modern mechanical sciences. He
strenuously asserts the contents of the rocks to be real shells, and
maintains the reality of the changes of the domain of land and sea
which these spoils of the ocean imply. “You will tell me,” he says,
“that nature and the influence of the stars have formed these shelly
forms in the mountains; then show me a place in the mountains where
the stars at the present day make shelly forms of different ages, and
of different species in the same place. And how, with that, will you
explain the gravel which is hardened in stages at different heights in
the mountains?” He then mentions several other particulars respecting
these evidences that the existing mountains were formerly in the bed
of the sea. Leonardo died in 1519. At present we refer to geological
essays like his, only so far as they are descriptive. Going onwards
with this view, we may notice Fracastoro, who wrote concerning the
petrifactions which were brought to light in the mountains of Verona,
when, in 1517, they were excavated for the purpose of repairing the
city. Little was done in the way of collection of facts for some time
after this. In 1669, Steno, a Dane resident in Italy, put forth his
treatise, <i>De Solido intra Solidum naturaliter contento</i>; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page508">508</a></span> following year,
Augustino Scilla, a Sicilian painter, published a Latin epistle, <i>De
Corporibus Marinis Lapidescentibus</i>, illustrated by good engravings
of fossil-shells, teeth, and corals.<a id="fnanchor8-18"
href="#note8-18"><span class="fnanchor">8</span></a> After another
interval of speculative controversy, we come to Antonio Vallisneri,
whose letters, <i>De’ Corpi Marini che su’ Monti si trovano</i>,
appeared at Venice in 1721. In these letters he describes the fossils
of Monte Bolca, and attempts to trace the extent of the marine
deposits of Italy,<a id="fnanchor9-18" href="#note9-18"><span
class="fnanchor">9</span></a> and to distinguish the most important of
the fossils. Similar descriptions and figures were published with
reference to our own country at a later period. In 1766, Brander’s
<i>Fossilia Hantoniensia</i>, or Hampshire Fossils, appeared;
containing excellent figures of fossil shells from a part of the south
coast of England; and similar works came forth in other parts of
Europe.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note8-18"
href="#fnanchor8-18">8</a></span> Augustine Scilla’s original drawings
of fossil shells, teeth, and corals, from which the engravings
mentioned in the text were executed, as well as the natural objects
from which the drawings were made, were bought by Woodward, and are
now in the Woodwardian Museum at Cambridge.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note9-18"
href="#fnanchor9-18">9</a></span> p. 20.</div>
<p>However exact might be the descriptions and figures thus produced,
they could not give such complete information as the objects
themselves, collected and permanently preserved in museums. Vallisneri
says,<a id="fnanchor10-18" href="#note10-18"><span
class="fnanchor">10</span></a> that having begun to collect fossils
for the purpose of forming a grotto, he selected the best, and
preserved them “as a noble diversion for the more curious.” The museum
of Calceolarius at Verona contained a celebrated collection of such
remains. A copious description of it appeared in 1622. Such
collections had been made from an earlier period, and catalogues of
them published. Thus Gessner’s work, <i>De Rerum Fossilium, Lapidum et
Gemmarum Figuris</i> (1565), contains a catalogue of the cabinet of
petrifactions collected by John Kentman; many catalogues of the same
kind appeared in the seventeenth century.<a id="fnanchor11-18"
href="#note11-18"><span class="fnanchor">11</span></a> Lhwyd’s
<i><span class="correction" title="emended from Lythophylaccii">Lythophylacii</span> Britannici Iconographia</i>, published at Oxford in
1669, and exhibiting a very ample catalogue of English Fossils
contained in the Ashmolean Museum, may be noticed as one of these.</p>

href="#fnanchor11-18">11</a></span> Parkinson, <i>Organic Remains</i>,
vol. i. p. 20.</div>
<p>One of the most remarkable occurrences in the progress of
descriptive geology in England, was the formation of a geological
museum by William Woodward as early as 1695. This collection, formed
with great labor, systematically arranged, and carefully catalogued,
he bequeathed to the University of Cambridge; founding and endowing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page509">509</a></span> at the same
time a professorship of the study of geology. The Woodwardian Museum
still subsists, a monument of the sagacity with which its author so
early saw the importance of such a collection.</p>
<p>Collections and descriptions of fossils, including in the term
specimens of minerals of all kinds, as well as organic remains, were
frequently made, and especially in places where mining was cultivated;
but under such circumstances, they scarcely tended at all to that
general and complete knowledge of the earth of which we are now
tracing the progress.</p>
<p>In more modern times, collections may be said to be the most
important books of the geologist, at least next to the strata
themselves. The identifications and arrangements of our best
geologists, the immense studies of fossil anatomy by Cuvier and
others, have been conducted mainly by means of collections of
specimens. They are more important in this study than in botany,
because specimens which contain important geological information are
both more rare and more permanent. Plants, though each individual is
perishable, perpetuate and diffuse their kind; while the organic
impression on a stone, if lost, may never occur in a second instance;
but, on the other hand, if it be preserved in the museum, the
individual is almost as permanent in this case, as the species in the
other.</p>
<p>I shall proceed to notice another mode in which such information
was conveyed.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>First Construction of Geological
Maps.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Dr. Lister</span>, a learned
physician, sent to the Royal Society, in 1683, a proposal for maps of
soils or minerals; in which he suggested that in the map of England,
for example, each soil and its boundaries might be distinguished by
color, or in some other way. Such a mode of expressing and connecting
our knowledge of the materials of the earth was, perhaps, obvious,
when the mass of knowledge became considerable. In 1720, Fontenelle,
in his observations on a paper of De Reaumur’s, which contained an
account of a deposit of fossil-shells in Touraine, says, that in order
to reason on such cases, “we must have a kind of geographical charts,
constructed according to the collection of shells found in the earth.”
But he justly adds, “What a quantity of observations, and what time
would it not require to form such maps!”</p>
<p>The execution of such projects required, not merely great labor,
but <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page510">510</a></span> several
steps in generalization and classification, before it could take
place. Still such attempts were made. In 1743, was published, <i>A new
Philosophico-chorographical Chart of East Kent, invented and
delineated</i> by Christopher Packe, M.D.; in which, however, the main
object is rather to express the course of the valleys than the
materials of the country. Guettard formed the project of a
mineralogical map of France, and Monnet carried this scheme into
effect in 1780,<a id="fnanchor12-18" href="#note12-18"><span
class="fnanchor">12</span></a> “by order of the king.” In these maps,
however, the country is not considered as divided into soils, still
less strata; but each part is marked with its predominant mineral
only. The spirit of generalization which constitutes the main value of
such a work is wanting.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note12-18"
href="#fnanchor12-18">12</a></span> <i>Atlas et Description
Minéralogique de la France, entrepris par ordre du Roi</i>, par MM.
Guettard et Monnet, Paris, 1780, pp. 212, with 31 maps.</div>
<p>Geological maps belong strictly to Descriptive Geology; they are
free from those wide and doubtful speculations which form so large a
portion of the earlier geological books. Yet even geological maps
cannot be usefully or consistently constructed without considerable
steps of classification and generalization. When, in our own time,
geologists were become weary of controversies respecting theory, they
applied themselves with extraordinary zeal to the construction of
stratigraphical maps of various countries; flattering themselves that
in this way they were merely recording incontestable facts and
differences. Nor do I mean to intimate that their facts were doubtful,
or their distinctions arbitrary. But still they were facts
interpreted, associated, and represented, by means of the
classifications and general laws which earlier geologists had
established; and thus even Descriptive Geology has been brought into
existence as a science by the formation of systems and the discovery
of principles. At this we cannot be surprized, when we recollect the
many steps which the formation of Classificatory Botany required. We
must now notice some of the discoveries which tended to the formation
of Systematic Descriptive Geology. <span class="pagenum"><a

<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Discovery of the Order and
Stratification of the Materials of the Earth.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THAT</span> the substances of which
the earth is framed are not scattered and mixed at random, but possess
identity and continuity to a considerable extent, Lister was aware,
when he proposed his map. But there is, in his suggestions, nothing
relating to stratification; nor any order of position, still less of
time, assigned to these materials. Woodward, however, appears to have
been fully aware of the general law of stratification. On collecting
information from all parts, “the result was,” he says, “that in time I
was abundantly assured that the circumstances of these things in
remoter countries were much the same with those of ours here: that the
stone, and other terrestrial matter in France, Flanders, Holland,
Spain, Italy, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden, was distinguished into
<i>strata or layers</i>, as it is in England; that these strata were
divided by parallel fissures; that there were enclosed in the stone
and all the other denser kinds of terrestrial matter, great numbers of
the shells, and other productions of the sea, in the same manner as in
that of this island.”<a id="fnanchor13-18" href="#note13-18"><span
class="fnanchor">13</span></a> So remarkable a truth, thus collected
from a copious collection of particulars by a patient induction, was
an important step in the science.</p>

followed into detail. <span class="correction" title="emended from

north-west; and Strachey<a id="fnanchor15-18" href="#note15-18"><span

description of certain coal-mines near Bath.<a id="fnanchor16-18"

appointed Woodwardian Professor at Cambridge <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page512">512</a></span> in 1762, described this stratified
structure of the earth far more distinctly than his predecessors, and
pointed out, as the consequence of it, that “the same kinds of earths,
stones, and minerals, will appear at the surface of the earth in long
parallel slips, parallel to the long ridges of mountains; and so, in
fact, we find them.”<a id="fnanchor17-18" href="#note17-18"><span

<p>Michell (as appeared by papers of his which were examined after his
death) had made himself acquainted with the series of English strata
which thus occur from Cambridge to York;&#8212;that is, from the chalk
to the coal. These relations of position required that geological
maps, to complete the information they conveyed, should be accompanied
by geological <i>Sections</i>, or imaginary representations of the
order and mode of superpositions, as well as of the superficial extent
of the strata, as in more recent times has usually been done. The
strata, as we travel from the higher to the lower, come from under
each other into view; and this <i>out-cropping</i>, <i>basseting</i>,
or by whatever other term it is described, is an important feature in
their description.</p>
<p>It was further noticed that these relations of position were
combined with other important facts, which irresistibly suggested the
notion of a relation in time. This, indeed, was implied in all
theories of the earth; but observations of the facts most require our
notice. Steno is asserted by Humboldt<a id="fnanchor18-18"
href="#note18-18"><span class="fnanchor">18</span></a> to be the first
who (in 1669) distinguished between rocks anterior to the existence of
plants and animals upon the globe, containing therefore no organic
remains; and rocks super-imposed on these, and full of such remains;
“turbidi maris sedimenta sibi invicem imposita”.</p>

<p>Rouelle is stated, by his pupil Desmarest, to have made some
additional and important observations. “He saw,” it is said, “that the
shells which occur in rocks were not the same in all countries; that
certain species occur together, while others do not occur in the same
beds; that there is a constant order in the arrangement of these
shells, certain species lying in distinct bands.”<a id="fnanchor19-18"

<p>Such divisions as these required to be marked by technical names. A
distinction was made of <i>l’ancienne terre</i> and <i>la nouvelle
terre</i>, to which Rouelle added a <i>travaille intermédiaire</i>.
Rouelle died in 1770, having been known by lectures, not by books.
Lehman, in 1756, claims for himself the credit of being the first to
observe and describe correctly the structure of stratified countries;
being ignorant, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page513">513</a></span>
probably, of the labors of Strachey in England. He divided mountains
into three classes;<a id="fnanchor20-18" href="#note20-18"><span
class="fnanchor">20</span></a> <i>primitive</i>, which were formed
with the world;&#8212;those which resulted from a partial destruction
of the primitive rocks;&#8212;and a third class resulting from local
or universal deluges. In 1759, also, Arduine,<a id="fnanchor21-18"
href="#note21-18"><span class="fnanchor">21</span></a> in his Memoirs
on the mountains of Padua, Vicenza, and Verona, deduced, from original
observations, the distinction of rocks into <i>primary</i>,
<i>secondary</i>, and <i>tertiary</i>.</p>

<p>The relations of position and fossils were, from this period,
inseparably connected with opinions concerning succession in time.
Odoardi remarked,<a id="fnanchor22-18" href="#note22-18"><span
class="fnanchor">22</span></a> that the strata of the <span
class="correction" title="emended from

those of the Apennine, (as Strachey had observed, that the strata
above the coal were unconformable to the coal;<a id="fnanchor23-18"
href="#note23-18"><span class="fnanchor">23</span></a>) and his work
contained a clear argument respecting the different ages of these two
classes of hills. Fuchsel was, in 1762, aware of the distinctness of
strata of different ages in Germany. Pallas and Saussure were guided
by general views of the same kind in observing the countries which
they visited: but, perhaps, the general circulation of such notions
was most due to Werner.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Systematic form given to Descriptive
Geology.&#8212;Werner.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Werner</span> expressed the general
relations of the strata of the earth by means of classifications
which, so far as general applicability is concerned, are extremely
imperfect and arbitrary; he promulgated a theory which almost entirely
neglected all the facts previously discovered respecting the grouping
of fossils,&#8212;which was founded upon observations made in a very
limited district of Germany,&#8212;and which was contradicted even by
the facts of this district. Yet the acuteness of his discrimination in
the subjects which he studied, the generality of the tenets he
asserted, and the charm which he threw about his speculations, gave to
Geology, or, as he termed it, <i>Geognosy</i>, a popularity and
reputation which it had never before possessed. His system had
asserted certain universal formations, which followed each other in a
constant order;&#8212;granite the lowest,&#8212;then mica-slate and
clay-slate;&#8212;upon these <i>primitive</i> rocks, generally highly
inclined, rest other <i>transition</i> strata;&#8212;upon these, lie
<i>secondary</i> ones, which being more nearly horizontal, are called
<i>flötz</i> or flat. The term <i>formation</i>, <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page514">514</a></span> which we have thus
introduced, indicating groups which, by evidence of all
kinds,&#8212;of their materials, their position, and their organic
contents,&#8212;are judged to belong to the same period, implies no
small amount of theory: yet this term, from this time forth, is to be
looked upon as a term of classification solely, so far as
classification can be separately attended to.</p>
<p>Werner’s distinctions of strata were for the most part drawn from
mineralogical constitution. Doubtless, he could not fail to perceive
the great importance of organic fossils. “I was witness,” says M. de
Humboldt, one of his most philosophical followers, “of the lively
satisfaction which he felt when, in 1792, M. de <span
class="correction" title="emended from Schlotheim">Schlottheim</span>,
one of the most distinguished geologists of the school of Freiberg,
began to make the relations of fossils to strata the principal object
of his studies.” But Werner and the disciples of his school, even the
most enlightened of them, never employed the characters derived from
organic remains with the same boldness and perseverance as those who
had from the first considered them as the leading phenomena: thus M.
de Humboldt expresses doubts which perhaps many other geologists do
not feel when, in 1823, he says, “Are we justified in concluding that
all formations are characterized by particular species? that the
fossil-shells of the chalk, the muschelkalk, the Jura limestone, and
the Alpine limestone, are all different? I think this would be pushing
the induction much too far.”<a id="fnanchor24-18"
href="#note24-18"><span class="fnanchor">24</span></a> In Prof.
Jamieson’s <i>Geognosy</i>, which may be taken as a representation of
the Wernerian doctrines, organic fossils are in no instance referred
to as characters of formations or strata. After the curious and
important evidence, contained in organic fossils, which had been
brought into view by the labors of Italian, English, and German
writers, the promulgation of a system of Descriptive Geology, in which
all this evidence was neglected, cannot be considered otherwise than
as a retrograde step in science.</p>

<p>Werner maintained the aqueous deposition of all strata above the
primitive rocks; even of those <i>trap</i> rocks, to which, from their
resemblance to lava and other phenomena, Raspe, Arduino, and others,
had already assigned a volcanic origin. The fierce and long
controversy between the <i>Vulcanists</i> and <i>Neptunists</i>, which
this dogma excited, does not belong to this part of our history; but
the discovery of veins of granite penetrating the superincumbent
slate, to which the controversy led, was an important event in
descriptive geology. Hutton, the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page515">515</a></span> author of the theory of igneous
causation which was in this country opposed to that of Werner, sought
and found this phenomenon in the Grampian hills, in 1785. This
supposed verification of his system “filled him with delight, and
called forth such marks of joy and exultation, that the guides who
accompanied him were persuaded, says his biographer,<a
id="fnanchor25-18" href="#note25-18"><span
class="fnanchor">25</span></a> that he must have discovered a vein of
silver or gold.”<a id="fnanchor26-18" href="#note26-18"><span

<p>Desmarest’s examination of Auvergne (1768) showed that there was
there an instance of a country which could not even be described
without terms implying that the basalt, which covered so large a
portion of it, had flowed from the craters of extinct volcanoes. His
map of Auvergne was an excellent example of a survey of such a
country, thus exhibiting features quite different from those of common
stratified countries.<a id="fnanchor27-18" href="#note27-18"><span

<p>The facts connected with metalliferous veins were also objects of
Werner’s attention. A knowledge of such facts is valuable to the
geologist as well as to the miner, although even yet much difficulty
attends all attempts to theorize concerning them. The facts of this
nature have been collected in great abundance in all mining districts;
and form a prominent part of the descriptive geology of such
districts; as, for example, the Hartz, and Cornwall.</p>
<p>Without further pursuing the history of the knowledge of the
inorganic phenomena of the earth, I turn to a still richer department
of geology, which is concerned with organic fossils.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Application of Organic Remains as a
Geological Character.&#8212;Smith.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Rouelle</span> and Odoardi had
perceived, as we have seen, that fossils were grouped in bands: but
from this general observation to the execution of a survey of a large
kingdom, founded upon this principle, would have been a vast stride,
even if the author of it had been aware of the doctrines thus asserted
by these writers. In fact, however, William Smith executed such a
survey of England, with no other guide or help than his own sagacity
and perseverance. In his employments as a civil engineer, he noticed
the remarkable continuity and constant order of the strata in the
neighborhood of Bath, as discriminated by their fossils; and about the
year 1793, he<a id="fnanchor28-18" href="#note28-18"><span
class="fnanchor">28</span></a> drew up a Tabular View of the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page516">516</a></span> strata of that
district, which contained the germ of his subsequent discoveries.
Finding in the north of England the same strata and associations of
strata with which he had become acquainted in the west, he was led to
name them and to represent them by means of maps, according to their
occurrence over the whole face of England. These maps appeared<a
id="fnanchor29-18" href="#note29-18"><span
class="fnanchor">29</span></a> in 1815; and a work by the same author,
entitled <i>The English Strata identified by Organic Remains</i>, came
forth later. But the views on which this identification of strata
rests, belong to a considerably earlier date; and had not only been
acted upon, but freely imparted in conversation many years before.</p>

<p>In the meantime the study of fossils was pursued with zeal in
various countries. Lamarck and Defrance employed themselves in
determining the fossil shells of the neighborhood of Paris;<a
id="fnanchor30-18" href="#note30-18"><span
class="fnanchor">30</span></a> and the interest inspired by this
subject was strongly nourished and stimulated by the memorable work of
Cuvier and Brongniart, <i>On the Environs of Paris</i>, published in
1811, and by Cuvier’s subsequent researches on the subjects thus
brought under notice. For now, not only the distinction, succession,
and arrangement, but many other relations among fossil strata,
irresistibly arrested the attention of the philosopher. Brongniart<a
id="fnanchor31-18" href="#note31-18"><span
class="fnanchor">31</span></a> showed that very striking resemblances
occurred in their fossil remains, between certain strata of Europe and
of North America; and proved that a rock may be so much disguised,
that the identity of the stratum can only be recognized by geological
characters.<a id="fnanchor32-18" href="#note32-18"><span

<p>The Italian geologists had found in their hills, for the most part,
the same species of shells which existed in their seas; but the German
and English writers, as Gesner,<a id="fnanchor33-18"
href="#note33-18"><span class="fnanchor">33</span></a> Raspe,<a
id="fnanchor34-18" href="#note34-18"><span

href="#note35-18"><span class="fnanchor">35</span></a> had perceived
that the fossil-shells were either of unknown species, or of such as
lived in distant latitudes. To decide that the animals and plants, of
which we find the remains in a fossil state, were of species now
extinct, obviously required an exact and extensive knowledge of
natural history. And if this were so, to assign the relations of the
past to the existing tribes of beings, and the peculiarities of their
vital processes and habits, were tasks which could not be performed
without the most consummate physiological skill and talent. Such
tasks, however, have been the familiar employments of geologists, and
naturalists incited and <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page517">517</a></span> appealed to by geologists, ever since
Cuvier published his examination of the fossil inhabitants of the
Paris basin. Without attempting a history of such labors, I may notice
a few circumstances connected with them.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 4.&#8212;<i>Advances in
Palæontology.&#8212;Cuvier.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">So</span> long as the organic
fossils which were found in the strata of the earth were the remains
of marine animals, it was very difficult for geologists to be assured
that the animals were such as did not exist in any part or clime of
the existing ocean. But when large land and river animals were
discovered, different from any known species, the persuasion that they
were of extinct races was forced upon the naturalist. Yet this opinion
was not taken up slightly, nor acquiesced in without many
struggles.</p>
<p>Bones supposed to belong to fossil elephants, were some of the
first with regard to which this conclusion was established. Such
remains occur in vast numbers in the soil and gravel of almost every
part of the world; especially in Siberia, where they are called the
bones of the <i>mammoth</i>. They had been noticed by the ancients, as
we learn from Pliny;<a id="fnanchor36-18" href="#note36-18"><span
class="fnanchor">36</span></a> and had been ascribed to human giants,
to elephants imported by the Romans, and to many other origins. But in
1796, Cuvier had examined these opinions with a more profound
knowledge than his predecessors; and he thus stated the result of his
researches.<a id="fnanchor37-18" href="#note37-18"><span
class="fnanchor">37</span></a> “With regard to what have been called
the fossil remains of elephants, from Tentzelius to Pallas, I believe
that I am in the condition to prove, that they belong to animals which
were very clearly different in species from our existing elephants,
although they resembled them sufficiently to be considered as
belonging to the same genera.” He had founded this conclusion
principally on the structure of the teeth, which he found to differ in
the Asiatic and African elephant; while, in the fossil animal, it was
different from both. But he also reasoned in part on the form of the
skull, of which the best-known example had been described in the
<i>Philosophical Transactions</i> as early as 1737.<a
id="fnanchor38-18" href="#note38-18"><span
class="fnanchor">38</span></a> “As soon,” says Cuvier, at a later
period, “as I became acquainted with Messerschmidt’s drawing, and
joined to the differences which it presented, those which I had myself
observed in the inferior jaw and the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page518">518</a></span> molar teeth, I no longer doubted that
the fossil elephants were of a species different from the Indian
elephant. This idea, which I announced to the Institute in the month
of January, 1796, opened to me views entirely new respecting the
theory of the earth; and determined me to devote myself to the long
researches and to the assiduous labors which have now occupied me for
twenty-five years.”<a id="fnanchor39-18" href="#note39-18"><span

<p>We have here, then, the starting-point of those researches
concerning extinct animals, which, ever since that time, have
attracted so large a share of notice from geologists and from the
world. Cuvier could hardly have anticipated the vast storehouse of
materials which lay under his feet, ready to supply him occupation of
the most intense interest in the career on which he had thus entered.
The examination of the strata on which Paris stands, and of which its
buildings consist, supplied him with animals, not only different from
existing ones, but some of them of great size and curious
peculiarities. A careful examination of the remains which these strata
contain was undertaken soon after the period we have referred to. In
1802, Defrance had collected several hundreds of undescribed species
of shells; and Lamarck<a id="fnanchor40-18" href="#note40-18"><span
class="fnanchor">40</span></a> began a series of Memoirs upon them;
remodelling the whole of Conchology, in order that they might be
included in its classifications. And two years afterwards (1804)
appears the first of Cuvier’s grand series of Memoirs containing the
restoration of the vertebrate animals of these strata. In this vast
natural museum, and in contributions from other parts of the globe, he
discovered the most extraordinary creatures:&#8212;the Palæotherium,<a
id="fnanchor41-18" href="#note41-18"><span
class="fnanchor">41</span></a> which is intermediate between the horse
and the pig; the Anoplotherium, which stands nearest to the rhinoceros
and the tapir; the Megalonix and Megatherium, animals of the sloth
tribe, but of the size of the ox and the rhinoceros. The Memoirs which
contained these and many other discoveries, set the naturalists to
work in every part of Europe.</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note41-18"
href="#fnanchor41-18">41</a></span> Daubuisson, ii. 411.</div>
<p>Another very curious class of animals was brought to light
principally by the geologists of England; animals of which the bones,
found in the <i>lias</i> stratum, were at first supposed to be those
of crocodiles. But in 1816,<a id="fnanchor42-18"
href="#note42-18"><span class="fnanchor">42</span></a> Sir Everard
Home says, “In truth, on a consideration of this skeleton, we cannot
but be inclined to believe, that among the animals destroyed by the
catastrophes of remote antiquity, there had <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page519">519</a></span> been some at least that differ so
entirely in their structure from any which now exist as to make it
impossible to arrange their fossil remains with any known class of
animals.” The animal thus referred to, being clearly intermediate
between fishes and lizards, was named by Mr. König,
<i>Ichthyosaurus</i>; and its structure and constitution were more
precisely determined by Mr. Conybeare in 1821, when he had occasion to
compare with it another extinct animal of which he and Mr. de la Beche
had collected the remains. This animal, still more nearly approaching
the lizard tribe, was by Mr. Conybeare called <i>Plesiosaurus</i>.<a
id="fnanchor43-18" href="#note43-18"><span
class="fnanchor">43</span></a> Of each of these two genera several
species were afterwards found.</p>

<p>Before this time, the differences of the races of animals and
plants belonging to the past and the present periods of the earth’s
history, had become a leading subject of speculation among geological
naturalists. The science produced by this study of the natural history
of former states of the earth has been termed <i>Palæontology</i>; and
there is no branch of human knowledge more fitted to stir men’s
wonder, or to excite them to the widest physiological speculations.
But in the present part of our history this science requires our
notice, only so far as it aims at the restoration of the types of
ancient animals, on clear and undoubted principles of comparative
anatomy. To show how extensive and how conclusive is the science when
thus directed, we need only refer to Cuvier’s <i>Ossemens
Fossiles</i>;<a id="fnanchor44-18" href="#note44-18"><span
class="fnanchor">44</span></a> a work of vast labor and profound
knowledge, which has opened wide the doors of this part of geology. I
do not here attempt even to mention the labors of the many other
eminent contributors to Palæontology; as Brocchi, Des Hayes, Sowerby,
Goldfuss, Agassiz, who have employed themselves on animals, and
Schlottheim, Brongniart, Hutton, Lindley, on plants.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note44-18"
href="#fnanchor44-18">44</a></span> The first edition appeared in
1812, consisting principally of the Memoirs to which reference has
already been made.</div>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [Among the many valuable contributions to Palæontology in
more recent times, I may especially mention Mr. Owen’s <i>Reports on
British Fossil Reptiles</i>, <i>on British Fossil Mammalia</i>, and
<i>on the Extinct Animals of Australia</i>, with descriptions of
certain Fossils indicative of large Marsupial Pachydermata: and M.
Agassiz’s <i>Report on the Fossil Fishes of the Devonian System</i>,
his <i>Synoptical Table of British Fossil Fishes</i>, and his
<i>Report on the Fishes of the London Clay</i>. All these are
contained in the volumes produced by the British Association from 1839
to 1845. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page520">520</a></span></p>
<p>A new and most important instrument of palæontological
investigation has been put in the geologist’s hand by Prof. Owen’s
discovery, that the internal structure of teeth, as disclosed by the
microscope, is a means of determining the kind of the animal. He has
carried into every part of the animal kingdom an examination founded
upon this discovery, and has published the results of this in his
<i>Odontography</i>. As an example of the application of this
character of animals, I may mention that a tooth brought from Riga by
Sir R. Murchison was in this way ascertained by Mr. Owen to belong to
a fish of the genus <i>Dendrodus</i>. (<i>Geology of Russia</i>, i.
67.)]</p>
<p>When it had thus been established, that the strata of the earth are
characterized by innumerable remains of the organized beings which
formerly inhabited it, and that anatomical and physiological
considerations must be carefully and skilfully applied in order
rightly to interpret these characters, the geologist and the
palæontologist obviously had, brought before them, many very wide and
striking questions. Of these we may give some instances; but, in the
first place, we may add a few words concerning those eminent
philosophers to whom the science owed the basis on which succeeding
speculations were to be built.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 5.&#8212;<i>Intellectual Characters of the Founders
of Systematic Descriptive Geology.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">It</span> would be in accordance
with the course we have pursued in treating of other subjects, that we
should attempt to point out in the founders of the science now under
consideration, those intellectual qualities and habits to which we
ascribe their success. The very recent date of the generalizations of
geology, which has hardly allowed us time to distinguish the calm
expression of the opinion of the wisest judges, might, in this
instance, relieve us from such a duty; but since our plan appears to
suggest it, we will, at least, endeavor to mark the characters of the
founders of geology, by a few of their prominent lines.</p>
<p>The three persons who must be looked upon as the main authors of
geological classification are, Werner, Smith, and Cuvier. These three
men were of very different mental constitution; and it will, perhaps,
not be difficult to compare them, in reference to those qualities
which we have all along represented as the main features of the
discoverer’s genius, clearness of ideas, the possession of numerous
facts, and the power of bringing these two elements into contact.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page521">521</a></span></p>
<p>In the German, considering him as a geologist, the ideal element
predominated. That Werner’s powers of external discrimination were
extremely acute, we have seen in speaking of him as a mineralogist;
and his talent and tendency for classifying were, in his mineralogical
studies, fully fed by an abundant store of observation; but when he
came to apply this methodizing power to geology, the love of system,
so fostered, appears to have been too strong for the collection of
facts he had to deal with. As we have already said, he promulgated, as
representing the world, a scheme collected from a province, and even
too hastily gathered from that narrow field. Yet his intense spirit of
method in some measure compensated for other deficiencies, and enabled
him to give the character of a science to what had been before a
collection of miscellaneous phenomena. The ardor of system-making
produced a sort of fusion, which, however superficial, served to bind
together the mass of incoherent and mixed materials, and thus to form,
though by strange and anomalous means, a structure of no small
strength and durability, like the ancient vitrified structures which
we find in some of our mountain regions.</p>
<p>Of a very different temper and character was William Smith. No
literary cultivation of his youth awoke in him the speculative love of
symmetry and system; but a singular clearness and precision of the
classifying power, which he possessed as a native talent, was
exercised and developed by exactly those geological facts among which
his philosophical task lay. Some of the advances which he made, had,
as we have seen, been at least entered upon by others who preceded
him: but of all this he was ignorant; and, perhaps, went on more
steadily and eagerly to work out his own ideas, from the persuasion
that they were entirely his own. At a later period of his life, he
himself published an account of the views which had animated him in
his earlier progress. In this account<a id="fnanchor45-18"
href="#note45-18"><span class="fnanchor">45</span></a> he dates his
attempts to discriminate and connect strata from the year 1790, at
which time he was twenty years old. In 1792, he “had considered how he
could best represent the order of superposition&#8212;continuity of
course&#8212;and general eastern declination of the strata.” Soon
after, doubts which had arisen were removed by the “discovery of a
mode of identifying the strata by the organized fossils respectively
imbedded therein.” And “thus stored with ideas,” as he expresses
himself, he began to communicate them to his friends. In all this, we
see great vividness <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page522">522</a></span> of thought and activity of mind,
unfolding itself exactly in proportion to the facts with which it had
to deal. We are reminded of that cyclopean architecture in which each
stone, as it occurs, is, with wonderful ingenuity, and with the least
possible alteration of its form, shaped so as to fit its place in a
solid and lasting edifice.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note45-18"
href="#fnanchor45-18">45</a></span> <i>Phil. Mag.</i> 1833, vol. i. p.
38.</div>
<p>Different yet again was the character (as a geological discoverer)
of the great naturalist of the beginning of the nineteenth century. In
that part of his labors of which we have now to speak, Cuvier’s
dominant ideas were rather physiological than geological. In his views
of past physical changes, he did not seek to include any ranges of
facts which lay much beyond the narrow field of the Paris basin. But
his sagacity in applying his own great principle of the Conditions of
Existence, gave him a peculiar and unparalleled power in interpreting
the most imperfect fossil records of extinct anatomy. In the
constitution of his mind, all philosophical endowments were so
admirably developed and disciplined, that it was difficult to say,
whether more of his power was due to genius or to culture. The talent
of classifying which he exercised in geology, was the result of the
most complete knowledge and skill in zoology; while his views
concerning the revolutions which had taken place in the organic and
inorganic world, were in no small degree aided by an extraordinary
command of historical and other literature. His guiding ideas had been
formed, his facts had been studied, by the assistance of all the
sciences which could be made to bear upon them. In his geological
labors we seem to see some beautiful temple, not only firm and fair in
itself, but decorated with sculpture and painting, and rich in all
that art and labor, memory and imagination, can contribute to its
beauty.</p>

<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Reception and Diffusion of
Systematic Geology.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IF</span> our nearness to the time of
the discoveries to which we have just referred, embarrasses us in
speaking of their authors, it makes it still more difficult to narrate
the reception with which these discoveries met. Yet here we may notice
a few facts which may not be without their interest.</p>
<p>The impression which Werner made upon his hearers was very strong;
and, as we have already said, disciples were gathered to his school
from every country, and then went forward into all parts of the world,
animated by the views which they had caught from him. We may say of
him, as has been so wisely said of a philosopher of a very different
kind,<a id="fnanchor46-18" href="#note46-18"><span
class="fnanchor">46</span></a> “He owed his influence to various
causes; at the head of which may be placed that genius for system,
which, though it cramps the growth of knowledge, perhaps finally
atones for that mischief by the zeal and activity which it rouses
among followers and opponents, who discover truth by accident, when in
pursuit of weapons for their warfare.” The list of Werner’s pupils for
a considerable period included most of the principal geologists of
Europe; Freisleben, Mohs, Esmark, d’Andrada, Raumer, Engelhart,
Charpentier, Brocchi. Alexander von Humboldt and Leopold von Buch went
forth from his school to observe America and Siberia, the Isles of the
Atlantic, and the coast of Norway. Professor Jameson established at
Edinburgh a Wernerian Society; and his lecture-room became a second
centre of Wernerian doctrines, whence proceeded many zealous
geological observers; among these we may mention as one of the most
distinguished, M. Ami Boué, though, like several others, he soon cast
away the peculiar opinions of the Wernerian school. The
classifications of this school were, however, diffused over the
civilized world with <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page524">524</a></span> extraordinary success; and were looked
upon with great respect, till the study of organic fossils threw them
into the shade.</p>

href="#fnanchor46-18">46</a></span> Mackintosh <i>on Hobbes</i>,
Dissert. p. 177.</div>
<p>Smith, on the other hand, long pursued his own thoughts without aid
and without sympathy. About 1799 he became acquainted with a few
gentlemen (Dr. Anderson, Mr. Richardson, Mr. Townsend, and Mr.
Davies), who had already given some attention to organic fossils, and
who were astonished to find his knowledge so much more exact and
extensive than their own. From this time he conceived the intention of
publishing his discoveries; but the want of literary leisure and
habits long prevented him. His knowledge was orally communicated
without reserve to many persons; and thus gradually and insensibly
became part of the public stock. When this diffusion of his views had
gone on for some time, his friends began to complain that the author
of them was deprived of his well-merited share of fame. His delay in
publication made it difficult to remedy this wrong; for soon after he
published his Geological Map of England, another appeared, founded
upon separate observations; and though, perhaps, not quite independent
of his, yet in many respects much more detailed and correct. Thus,
though his general ideas obtained universal currency, he did not
assume his due prominence as a geologist. In 1818, a generous attempt
was made to direct a proper degree of public gratitude to him, in an
article in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, the production of Dr. Fitton,
a distinguished English geologist. And when the eminent philosopher,
Wollaston, had bequeathed to the Geological Society of London a fund
from which a gold medal was to be awarded to geological services, the
first of such medals was, in 1831, “given to Mr. William Smith, in
consideration of his being a great original discoverer in English
geology; and especially for his having been the first in this country
to discover and to teach the identification of strata, and to
determine their succession by means of their imbedded fossils.”</p>
<p>Cuvier’s discoveries, on the other hand, both from the high
philosophic fame of their author, and from their intrinsic importance,
arrested at once the attention of scientific Europe; and,
notwithstanding the undoubted priority of Smith’s labors, for a long
time were looked upon as the starting-point of our knowledge of
organic fossils. And, in reality, although Cuvier’s memoirs derived
the greatest part of their value from his zoological conclusions, they
reflected back no small portion of interest on the classifications of
strata which were involved in his inferences. And the views which he
presented gave to geology an attractive and striking character, and a
connexion with <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page525">525</a></span>
large physiological as well as physical principles, which added
incomparably to its dignity and charm.</p>
<p>In tracing the reception and diffusion of doctrines such as those
of Smith and Cuvier, we ought not to omit to notice more especially
the formation and history of the Geological Society of London, just
mentioned. It was established in 1807, with a view to multiply and
record observations, and patiently to await the result of some future
period; that is, its founders resolved to apply themselves to
Descriptive Geology, thinking the time not come for that theoretical
geology which had then long fired the controversial ardor of
Neptunists and Plutonists. The first volume of the Transactions of
this society was published in 1811. The greater part of the contents
of this volume<a id="fnanchor47-18" href="#note47-18"><span
class="fnanchor">47</span></a> savor of the notions of the Wernerian
school; and there are papers on some of the districts in England most
rich in fossils, which Mr. Conybeare says, well exhibit the low state
of secondary geology at that period. But a paper by Mr. Parkinson
refers to the discoveries both of Smith and of Cuvier; and in the next
volume, Mr. Webster gives an account of the Isle of Wight, following
the admirable model of Cuvier and Brongniart’s account of the Paris
basin. “If we compare this memoir of Mr. Webster with the preceding
one of Dr. Berger (also of the Isle of Wight), they at once show
themselves to belong to two very distinct eras of science; and it is
difficult to believe that the interval which elapsed between their
respective publication was only three or four years.”<a

<p>Among the events belonging to the diffusion of sound geological
views in this country, we may notice the publication of a little
volume entitled, <i>The Geology of England and Wales</i>, by Mr.
Conybeare and Mr. Phillips, in 1821; an event far more important than,
from the modest form and character of the work, it might at first
sight appear. By describing in detail the geological structure and
circumstances of England (at least as far downwards as the coal), it
enabled a very wide class of readers to understand and verify the
classifications which geology had then very recently established;
while the extensive knowledge and philosophical spirit of Mr.
Conybeare rendered it, under the guise of a topographical enumeration,
in reality a profound and instructive scientific treatise. The vast
impulse which it gave to the study of sound descriptive geology was
felt and acknowledged in other countries, as well as in Britain. <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page526">526</a></span></p>
<p>Since that period, Descriptive Geology in England has constantly
advanced. The advance has been due mainly to the labors of the members
of the Geological Society; on whose merits as cultivators of their
science, none but those who are themselves masters of the subject,
have a right to dwell. Yet some parts of the scientific character of
these men may be appreciated by the general speculator; for they have
shown that there are no talents and no endowments which may not find
their fitting employment in this science. Besides that they have
united laborious research and comprehensive views, acuteness and
learning, zeal and knowledge; the philosophical eloquence with which
they have conducted their discussions has had a most beneficial
influence on the tone of their speculations; and their researches in
the field, which have carried them into every country and every class
of society, have given them that prompt and liberal spirit, and that
open and cordial bearing, which results from intercourse with the
world on a large and unfettered scale. It is not too much to say, that
in our time, Practical Geology has been one of the best schools of
philosophical and general culture of mind.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Application of Systematic Geology.
Geological Surveys and Maps.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Such</span> surveys as that which
Conybeare and Phillips’s book presented with respect to England, were
not only a means of disseminating the knowledge implied in the
classifications of such a work, but they were also an essential part
of the Application and Extension of the principles established by the
founders of Systematic Geology. As soon as the truth of such a system
was generally acknowledged, the persuasion of the propriety of
geological surveys and maps of each country could not but impress
itself on men’s minds.</p>
<p>When the earlier writers, as Lister and Fontenelle, spoke of
mineralogical and fossilological maps, they could hardly be said to
know the meaning of the terms which they thus used. But when
subsequent classifications had shown how such a suggestion might be
carried into effect, and to what important consequences it might lead,
the task was undertaken in various countries in a vigorous and
consistent manner. In England, besides Smith’s map, another, drawn up
by Mr. Greenough, was published by the Geological Society in 1819;
and, being founded on very numerous observations of the author and his
friends, made with great labor and cost, was not only an important
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page527">527</a></span> correction and
confirmation of Smith’s labors, but a valuable storehouse and standard
of what had then been done in English geology. Leopold von Buch had
constructed a geological map of a large portion of Germany, about the
same period; but, aware of the difficulty of the task he had thus
attempted, he still forbore to publish it. At a later period, and as
materials accumulated, more detailed maps of parts of Germany were
produced by Hoffmann and others. The French government entrusted to a
distinguished Professor of the School of Mines (M. Brochant de
Villiers), the task of constructing a map of France on the model of
Mr. Greenough’s; associating with him two younger persons, selected
for their energy and talents, MM. Beaumont and Dufrénoy. We shall have
occasion <a href="#v2page532">hereafter</a> to speak of the execution
of this survey. By various persons, geological maps of almost every
country and province of Europe, and of many parts of Asia and America,
have been published. I need not enumerate these, but I may refer to
the account given of them by Mr. Conybeare, in the <i>Reports of the
British Association for</i> 1832, p. 384. These various essays may be
considered as contributions, though hitherto undoubtedly very
imperfect ones, to that at which Descriptive Geology ought to aim, and
which is requisite as a foundation for sound theory;&#8212;a complete
geological survey of the whole earth. But we must say a few words
respecting the language in which such a survey must be written.</p>
<p>As we have already said, that condition which made such maps and
the accompanying descriptions possible, was that the strata and their
contents had previously undergone classification and arrangement at
the hands of the fathers of geology. Classification, in this as in
other cases, implied names which should give to the classes
distinctness and permanence; and when the series of strata belonging
to one country were referred to in the description of another, in
which they appeared, as was usually the case, under an aspect at least
somewhat different, the supposed identification required a peculiar
study of each case; and thus Geology had arrived at the point, which
we have before had to notice as one of the stages of the progress of
Classificatory Botany, at which a technical <i>nomenclature</i> and a
well-understood <i>synonymy</i> were essential parts of the
science.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Geological Nomenclature.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">By</span> Nomenclature we mean a
<em>system</em> of names; and hence we can <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page528">528</a></span> not speak of a Geological Nomenclature
till we come to Werner and Smith. The earlier mineralogists had
employed names, often artificial and arbitrary, for special minerals,
but no technical and constant names for strata. The elements of
Werner’s names for the members of his geological series were words in
use among miners, as <i>Gneiss</i>, <i>Grauwacke</i>,
<i>Thonschiefer</i>, <i>Rothe todte liegende</i>, <i>Zechstein</i>; or
arbitrary names of the mineralogists, as Syenite, Serpentine,
Porphyry, Granite. But the more technical part of his phraseology was
taken from that which is the worst kind of name, arbitrary numeration.
Thus he had his <i>first</i> sandstone formation, <i>second</i>
sandstone, <i>third</i> sandstone; <i>first</i> flötz limestone,
<i>second</i> flötz limestone, <i>third</i> flötz limestone. Such
names are, beyond all others, liable to mistake in their application,
and likely to be expelled by the progress of knowledge; and
accordingly, though the Wernerian names for rocks mineralogically
distinguished, have still some currency, his sandstones and
limestones, after creating endless confusion while his authority had
any sway, have utterly disappeared from good geological works.</p>
<p>The nomenclature of Smith was founded upon English provincial terms
of very barbarous aspect, as <i>Cornbrash</i>, <i>Lias</i>,
<i>Gault</i>, <i>Clunch Clay</i>, <i>Coral Rag</i>. Yet these terms
were widely diffused when his classification was generally accepted;
they kept their place, precisely because they had no systematic
signification; and many of them are at present part of the geological
language of the whole civilized world.</p>
<p>Another kind of names which has been very prevalent among
geologists are those borrowed from places. Thus the Wernerians spoke
of Alpine Limestone and Jura Limestone; the English, of Kimmeridge
Clay and Oxford Clay, Purbeck Marble, and Portland Rock. These names,
referring to the stratum of a known locality as a type, were good, as
far as an identity with that type had been traced; but when this had
been incompletely done, they were liable to great ambiguity. If the
Alps or the Jura contain several formations of limestone, such terms
as we have noticed, borrowed from those mountains, cease to be
necessarily definite, and may give rise to much confusion.</p>
<p>Descriptive names, although they might be supposed to be the best,
have, in fact, rarely been fortunate. The reason of this is
obvious;&#8212;the mark which has been selected for description may
easily fail to be essential; and the obvious connexions of natural
facts may overleap the arbitrary definition. As we have already stated
in the history of botany, the establishment of descriptive marks of
real classes presupposes the important but difficult step, of the
discovery of such marks. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page529">529</a></span> Hence those descriptive names only have
been really useful in geology which had been used without any
scrupulous regard to the appropriateness of the description. The
<i>Green Sand</i> may be white, brown, or red; the <i>Mountain
Limestone</i> may occur only in valleys; the <i>Oolite</i> may have no
roe-like structure; and yet these may be excellent geological names,
if they be applied to formations geologically identical with those
which the phrases originally designated. The signification may assist
the memory, but must not be allowed to subjugate the faculty of
natural classification.</p>
<p>The terms which have been formed by geologists in recent times have
been drawn from sources similar to those of the older ones, and will
have their fortune determined by the same conditions. Thus Mr. Lyell
has given to the divisions of the tertiary strata the appellations
<i>Pleiocene</i>, <i>Meiocene</i>, <i>Eocene</i>, accordingly as they
contain a <em>majority</em> of recent species of shells, a
<em>minority</em> of such species, or a small proportion of living
species, which may be looked upon as indicating the <i>dawn</i> of the
existing state of the animate creation. But in this case, he wisely
treats his distinctions, not as definitions, but as the marks of
natural groups. “The plurality of species indicated by the name
<i>pleiocene</i> must not,” he says,<a id="fnanchor49-18"
href="#note49-18"><span class="fnanchor">49</span></a> “be understood
to imply an absolute majority of recent fossil shells in all cases,
but a comparative preponderance wherever the pleiocene are contrasted
with strata of the period immediately preceding.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note49-18"
href="#fnanchor49-18">49</a></span> <i>Geol.</i> iii. 392.</div>
<p>Mr. Lyell might have added, that no precise percentage of recent
species, nor any numerical criterion whatever, can be allowed to
overbear the closer natural relations of strata, proved by evidence of
a superior kind, if such can be found. And this would be the proper
answer to the objection made by De la Beche to these names; namely,
that it may happen that the <i>meiocene</i> rocks of one country may
be of the same date as the <i>pleiocene</i> of another; the same
formation having in one place a majority, in another a minority, of
existing species. We are not to run into this incongruity, for we are
not so to apply the names. The formation which has been called
pleiocene, must continue to be so called, even where the majority of
recent species fails; and all rocks that agree with that in date,
without further reference to the numerical relations of their fossils,
must also share in the name.</p>
<p>To invent good names for these large divisions of the series of
strata is indeed extremely difficult. The term <i>Oolite</i> is an
instance in which <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page530">530</a></span> a descriptive word has become permanent
in a case of this kind; and, in imitation of it, <i>Pœcilite</i> (from
ποικίλος, various,<span class="correction" title="emended from
(">)</span> has been proposed by Mr. Conybeare<a id="fnanchor50-18"
href="#note50-18"><span class="fnanchor">50</span></a> as a name for
the group of strata inferior to the oolites, of which the
<i>Variegated</i> Sandstone (Bunter Sandstein, Grès Bigarré,) is a
conspicuous member. For the series of formations which lies
immediately over the rocks in which no organic remains are found, the
term <i>Transition</i> was long used, but with extreme ambiguity and
vagueness. When this series, or rather the upper part of it, was well
examined in South Wales, where it consists of many well-marked
members, and may be probably taken as a type for a large portion of
the rest of the world, it became necessary to give to the group thus
explored a name not necessarily leading to assumption or controversy.
Mr. Murchison selected the term <i>Silurian</i>, borrowed from the
former inhabitants of the country in which his types were found; and
this is a term excellent in many respects; but one which will probably
not quite supersede “Transition,” because, in other places, transition
rocks occur which correspond to none of the members of the Silurian
region.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note50-18"
href="#fnanchor50-18">50</a></span> <i>Report</i>, p. 379.</div>
<p>Though new names are inevitable accompaniments of new views of
classification, and though, therefore, the geological discoverer must
be allowed a right to coin them, this is a privilege which, for the
sake of his own credit, and the circulation of his tokens, he must
exercise with great temperance and judgment. M. Brongniart may be
taken as an example of the neglect of this caution. Acting upon the
principle, in itself a sound one, that inconveniences arise from
geological terms which have a mineralogical signification, he has
given an entirely new list of names of the members of the geological
series. Thus the primitive unstratified rocks are <i>terrains
agalysiens</i>; the transition semi-compact are <i>hemilysiens</i>;
the sedimentary strata are <i>yzemiens</i>; the diluvial deposits are
<i>clysmiens</i>; and these divisions are subdivided by designations
equally novel; thus of the “terrains yzemiens,” members are&#8212;the
terrains <i>clastiques</i>, <i>tritoniens</i>, <i>protéïques</i>,
<i>palæotheriens</i>, <i>epilymniques</i>, <i>thalassiques</i>.<a
id="fnanchor51-18" href="#note51-18"><span
class="fnanchor">51</span></a> Such a nomenclature appears to labor
under great inconveniences, since the terms are descriptive in their
derivation, yet are not generally intelligible, and refer to
theoretical views yet have not the recommendation of systematic
connexion.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 4.&#8212;<i>Geological Synonymy, or Determination of
Geological Equivalents.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">It</span> will easily be supposed
that with so many different sources of names as we have mentioned, the
same stratum may be called by different designations; and thus a
synonymy may be necessary for geology; as it was for botany in the
time of Bauhin, when the same plants had been spoken of by so many
different appellations in different authors. But in reality, the
synonymy of geology is a still more important part of the subject than
the analogy of botany would lead us to suppose. For in plants, the
species are really fixed, and easily known when seen; and the
ambiguity is only in the imperfect communication or confused ideas of
the observers. But in geology, the identity of a stratum or formation
in different places, though not an arbitrary, may be a very doubtful
matter, even to him who has seen and examined. To assign its right
character and place to a stratum in a new country, is, in a great
degree, to establish the whole geological history of the country. To
assume that the same names may rightly be applied to the strata of
different countries, is to take for granted, not indeed the Wernerian
dogma of universal formations, but a considerable degree of generality
and uniformity in the known formations. And how far this generality
and uniformity prevail, observation alone can teach. The search for
geological synonyms in different countries brings before us two
questions;&#8212;first, <em>are</em> there such synonyms? and only in
the second place, and as far as they occur, <em>what</em> are
they?</p>
<p>In fact, it is found that although formations which must be
considered as geologically identical (because otherwise no
classification is possible,) do extend over large regions, and pass
from country to country, their identity includes certain
modifications; and the determination of the identity and of the
modifications are inseparably involved with each other, and almost
necessarily entangled with theoretical considerations. And in two
countries, in which we find this modified coincidence, instead of
saying that the strata are identical, and that their designations are
synonyms, we may, with more propriety, consider them as two
corresponding series; of which the members of the one may be treated
as the <i>Representatives</i> or <i>Equivalents</i> of the members of
the other.</p>
<p>This doctrine of Representatives or Equivalents supposes that the
geological phenomena in the two countries have been the results of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page532">532</a></span> similar series
of events, which have, in some measure, coincided in time and order;
and thus, as we have said, refers us to a theory. But yet, considered
merely as a step in classification, the comparison of the geological
series of strata in different countries is, in the highest degree,
important and interesting. Indeed in the same manner in which the
separation of Classificatory from Chemical Mineralogy is necessary for
the completion of mineralogical science, the comparative
Classification of the strata of different countries according to their
resemblances and differences alone, is requisite as a basis for a
Theory of their causes. But, as will easily be imagined from its
nature, this part of descriptive geology deals with the most difficult
and the most elevated problems; and requires a rare union of laborious
observation with a comprehensive spirit of philosophical
classification.</p>
<p>In order to give instances of this process (for of the vast labor
and great talents which have been thus employed in England, France,
and Germany, it is only instances that we can give,) I may refer to
the geological survey of France, which was executed, as we have
already stated, by order of the government. In this undertaking it was
intended to obtain a knowledge of the whole mineral structure of
France; but no small portion of this knowledge was brought into view,
when a synonymy had been established between the Secondary Rocks of
France and the corresponding members of the English and German series,
which had been so well studied as to have become classical points of
standard reference. For the purpose of doing this, the principal
directors of the survey, MM. Brochant de Villiers, De Beaumont, and
Dufrénoy, came to England in 1822, and following the steps of the best
English geologists, in a few months made themselves acquainted with
the English series. They then returned to France, and, starting from
the chalk of Paris in various directions, travelled on the lines which
carried them over the edges of the strata which emerge from beneath
the chalk, identifying, as they could, the strata with their foreign
analogues. They thus recognized almost all of the principal beds of
the oolitic series of England.<a id="fnanchor52-18"
href="#note52-18"><span class="fnanchor">52</span></a> At the same
time they found differences as well as resemblances. Thus the Portland
and Kimmeridge beds of France were found to contain in abundance a
certain shell, the <i>gryphæa virgula</i>, which had not before been
much remarked in those beds in England. With regard to the synonyms in
Germany, on the other hand, a difference of opinion <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page533">533</a></span> arose between M. Elie
de Beaumont and M. Voltz,<a id="fnanchor53-18" href="#note53-18"><span
class="fnanchor">53</span></a> the former considering the <i>Grès de
Vosges</i> as the equivalent of the <i>Rothe todte liegende</i>, which
occurs beneath the Zechstein, while M. Voltz held that it was the
lower portion of the Red or <i>Variegated Sandstone</i> which rests on
the Zechstein.</p>

href="#fnanchor53-18">53</a></span> De la Beche, <i>Manual</i>,
381.</div>
<p>In the same manner, from the first promulgation of the Wernerian
system, attempts were made to identify the English with the German
members of the geological alphabet; but it was long before this
alphabet was rightly read. Thus the English geologists who first tried
to apply the Wernerian series to this country, conceived the Old and
New Red Sandstone of England to be the same with the Old and New Red
Sandstone of Werner; whereas Werner’s Old Red, the Rothe todte
liegende, is above the coal, while the English Old Red is below it.
This mistake led to a further erroneous identification of our Mountain
Limestone with Werner’s First Flötz Limestone; and caused an almost
inextricable confusion, which, even at a recent period, has perplexed
the views of German geologists respecting this country. Again, the
Lias of England was, at first, supposed to be the equivalent of the
Muschelkalk of Germany. But the error of this identification was
brought into view by examinations and discussions in which MM.
Œyenhausen and Dechen took the lead; and at a later period, Professor
Sedgwick, by a laborious examination of the strata of England, was
enabled to show the true relation of this part of the geology of the
two countries. According to him, the New Red Sandstone of England,
considered as one great complex formation, may be divided into seven
members, composed of sandstones, limestones, and marls; five of which
represent respectively the <i>Rothe todte liegende</i>; the <i>Kupfer
schiefer</i>; the <i>Zechstein</i>, (with the <i>Rauchwacké</i>,
<i>Asche</i>, and <i>Stinkstein</i> of the Thuringenwald;) the
<i>Bunter sandstein</i>; and the <i>Keuper</i>: while the
<i>Muschelkalk</i>, which lies between the two last members of the
German list, has not yet been discovered in our geological series.
“Such a coincidence,” he observes,<a id="fnanchor54-18"
href="#note54-18"><span class="fnanchor">54</span></a> “in the
subdivisions of two distant mechanical deposits, even upon the
supposition of their being strictly contemporaneous, is truly
astonishing. It has not been assumed hypothetically, but is the fair
result of the facts which are recorded in this paper.”</p>

<p>As an example in which the study of geological equivalents becomes
still more difficult, we may notice the attempts to refer the strata
of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page534">534</a></span> the Alps to
those of the north-west of Europe. The dark-colored marbles and
schists resembling mica slate<a id="fnanchor55-18"
href="#note55-18"><span class="fnanchor">55</span></a> were, during
the prevalence of the Wernerian theory, referred, as was natural, to
the transition class. The striking physical characters of this
mountain region, and its long-standing celebrity as a subject of
mineralogical examination, made a complete subversion of the received
opinion respecting its place in the geological series, an event of
great importance in the history of the science. Yet this was what
occurred when Dr. Buckland, in 1820, threw his piercing glance upon
this district. He immediately pointed out that these masses, by their
fossils, approach to the Oolitic Series of this country. From this
view it followed, that the geological equivalents of that series were
to be found among rocks in which the mineralogical characters were
altogether different, and that the loose limestones of England
represent some of the highly-compact and crystalline marbles of Italy
and Greece. This view was confirmed by subsequent investigations; and
the correspondence was traced, not only in the general body of the
formations, but in the occurrence of the Red Marl at its bottom, and
the Green Sand and Chalk at its top.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note55-18"
href="#fnanchor55-18">55</a></span> De la Beche, <i>Manual</i>,
313.</div>
<p>The talents and the knowledge which such tasks require are of no
ordinary kind; nor, even with a consummate acquaintance with the
well-ascertained formations, can the place of problematical strata be
decided without immense labor. Thus the examination and delineation of
hundreds of shells by the most skilful conchologists, has been thought
necessary in order to determine whether the calcareous beds of
Maestricht and of Gosau are or are not intermediate, as to their
organic contents, between the chalk and the tertiary formations. And
scarcely any point of geological classification can be settled without
a similar union of the accomplished naturalist with the laborious
geological collector.</p>
<p>It follows from the views already presented, of this part of
geology, that no attempt to apply to distant countries the names by
which the well-known European strata have been described, can be of
any value, if not accompanied by a corresponding attempt to show how
far the European series is really applicable. This must be borne in
mind in estimating the import of the geological accounts which have
been given of various parts of Asia, Africa, and America. For
instance, when the carboniferous group and the new red sandstone are
stated to <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page535">535</a></span> be
found in India, we require to be assured that these formations are, in
some way, the equivalents of their synonyms in countries better
explored. Till this is done, the results of observation in such places
would be better conveyed by a nomenclature implying only those facts
of resemblance, difference, and order, which have been ascertained in
the country so described. We know that serious errors were incurred by
the attempts made to identify the Tertiary strata of other countries
with those first studied in the Paris basin. Fancied points of
resemblance, Mr. Lyell observes, were magnified into undue importance,
and essential differences in mineral character and organic contents
were slurred over.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [The extension of geological surveys, the construction of
geological maps, and the determination of the geological equivalents
which replace each other in various countries, have been carried on in
continuation of the labors mentioned above, with enlarged activity,
range, and means. It is estimated that one-third of the land of each
hemisphere has been geologically explored; and that thus Descriptive
Geology has now been prosecuted so far, that it is not likely that
even the extension of it to the whole globe would give any material
novelty of aspect to Theoretical Geology. The recent literature of the
subject is so voluminous that it is impossible for me to give any
account of it here; very imperfectly acquainted, as I am, even with
the English portion, and still more, with what has been produced in
other countries.</p>
<p>While I admire the energetic and enlightened labors by which the
philosophers of France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Russia, and America,
have promoted scientific geology, I may be allowed to rejoice to see
in the very phraseology of the subject, the evidence that English
geologists have not failed to contribute their share to the latest
advances in the science. The following order of strata proceeding
upwards is now, I think, recognized throughout Europe. The
<i>Silurian</i>; the <i>Devonian</i> (Old Red Sandstone;) the
<i>Carboniferous</i>; the <i>Permian</i>, (Lower part of the new Red
Sandstone series;) the <i>Trias</i>, (Upper three members of the New
Red Sandstone series;) the <i>Lias</i>; the <i>Oolite</i>, (in which
are reckoned by M. D’Orbigny the Etages <i>Bathonien</i>,
<i>Oxonien</i>, <i>Kimmeridgien</i>, and <i>Portlandien</i>;) the
<i>Neocomien</i>, (Lower Green Sand,) the Chalk; and above these,
Tertiary and Supra-Tertiary beds. Of these, the Silurian, described by
Sir R. Murchison from its types in South Wales, has been traced by
European Geologists through the Ardennes, Servia, Turkey, the shores
of the Gulf of Finland, the valley <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page536">536</a></span> of the Mississippi, the west coast of
North America, and the mountains of South America. Again, the labors
of Prof. Sedgwick and Sir R. Murchison, in 1836, ’7, and ’8, aided by
the sagacity of Mr. Lonsdale, led to their placing certain rocks of
Devon and Cornwall as a formation intermediate between the Silurian
and Carboniferous Series; and the Devonian System thus established has
been accepted by geologists in general, and has been traced, not only
in various parts of Europe, but in Australia and Tasmania, and in the
neighborhood of the Alleganies.</p>
<p>Above the Carboniferous Series, Sir R. Murchison and his fellow
laborers, M. de Verneuil and Count Keyserling, have found in Russia a
well-developed series of rocks occupying the ancient kingdom of
Permia, which they have hence called the <i>Permian formation</i>; and
this term also has found general acceptance. The next group, the
Keuper, Muschelkalk, and Bunter Sandstein of Germany, has been termed
<i>Trias</i> by the continental geologists. The <i>Neocomien</i> is
called from Neuchatel, where it is largely developed. Below all these
rocks come, in England, the <i>Cambrian</i> on which Prof. Sedgwick
has expended so many years of valuable labor. The comparison of the
Protozoic and Hypozoic rocks of different countries is probably still
incomplete.</p>
<p>The geologists of North America have made great progress in
decyphering and describing the structure of their own country; and
they have wisely gone, in a great measure, upon the plan which I have
commended at the end of the third <a
href="#v2page531">Chapter</a>;&#8212;they have compared the rocks of
their own country with each other, and given to the different beds and
formations names borrowed from their own localities. This course will facilitate rather than impede the redaction of
their classification to its synonyms and equivalents in the old
world.</p>
<p>Of course it is not to be expected nor desired that books belonging
to Descriptive Geology shall exclude the other two branches of the
subject, Geological Dynamics and Physical Geology. On the contrary,
among the most valuable contributions to both these departments have
been speculations appended to descriptive works. And this is naturally
and rightly more and more the case as the description embraces a wider
field. The noble work <i>On the Geology of Russia and the Urals</i>,
by Sir Roderick Murchison and his companions, is a great example of
this, as of other merits in a geological book. The author introduces
into his pages the various portions of geological dynamics of which I
shall have to speak afterwards; and thus endeavors to make out the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page537">537</a></span> physical
history of the region, the boundaries of its raised sea bottoms, the
shores of the great continent on which the mammoths lived, the period
when the gold ore was formed, and when the watershed of the Ural chain
was elevated.]</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Attempts to Discover General Laws in
Geology.</span></h3>
<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>General Geological
Phenomena.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">BESIDES</span> thus noticing such
features in the rocks of each country as were necessary to the
identification of the strata, geologists have had many other phenomena
of the earth’s surface and materials presented to their notice; and
these they have, to a certain extent, attempted to generalize, so as
to obtain on this subject what we have elsewhere termed the Laws of
Phenomena, which are the best materials for physical theory. Without
dwelling long upon these, we may briefly note some of the most
obvious. Thus it has been observed that mountain ranges often consist
of a ridge of subjacent rock, on which lie, on each side, strata
sloping from the ridge. Such a ridge is an <i>Anticlinal Line</i>, a
<i>Mineralogical Axis</i>. The sloping strata present their
<i>Escarpements</i>, or steep edges, to this axis. Again, in mining
countries, the <i>Veins</i> which contain the ore are usually a system
of <i>parallel</i> and nearly vertical partitions in the rock; and
these are, in very many cases, intersected by another system of veins
parallel to each other and nearly <i>perpendicular</i> to the former.
Rocky regions are often intersected by <i>Faults</i>, or fissures
interrupting the strata, in which the rock on one side the fissure
appears to have been at first continuous with that on the other, and
shoved aside or up or down after the fracture. Again, besides these
larger fractures, rocks have <i>Joints</i>,&#8212;separations, or
tendencies to separate in some directions rather than in others; and a
<i>slaty Cleavage</i>, in which the parallel subdivisions may be
carried on, so as to produce laminæ of indefinite thinness. As an
example of those laws of phenomena of which we have spoken, we may
instance the general law asserted by Prof. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page538">538</a></span> Sedgwick (not, however, as free from
exception), that in one particular class of rocks the slaty Cleavage
<em>never</em> coincides with the Direction of the strata.</p>
<p>The phenomena of metalliferous veins may be referred to, as another
large class of facts which demand the notice of the geologist. It
would be difficult to point out briefly any general laws which prevail
in such cases; but in order to show the curious and complex nature of
the facts, it may be sufficient to refer to the description of the
metallic veins of Cornwall by Mr. Carne;<a id="fnanchor56-18"
href="#note56-18"><span class="fnanchor">56</span></a> in which the
author maintains that their various contents, and the manner in which
they cut across, and <i>stop</i>, or <i>shift</i>, each other, leads
naturally to the assumption of veins of no less than six or eight
different ages in one kind of rock.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note56-18"
href="#fnanchor56-18">56</a></span> <i>Transactions of the Geol. Soc.
of Cornwall</i>, vol. ii.</div>
<p>Again, as important characters belonging to the physical history of
the earth, and therefore to geology, we may notice all the general
laws which refer to its temperature;&#8212;both the laws of climate,
as determined by the <i>isothermal lines</i>, which Humboldt has
drawn, by the aid of very numerous observations made in all parts of
the world; and also those still more curious facts, of the increase of
temperature which takes place as we descend in the solid mass. The
latter circumstance, after being for a while rejected as a fable, or
explained away as an accident, is now generally acknowledged to be the
true state of things in many distant parts of the globe, and probably
in all.</p>
<p>Again, to turn to cases of another kind: some writers have
endeavored to state in a general manner laws according to which the
members of the geological series succeed each other; and to reduce
apparent anomalies to order of a wider kind. Among those who have
written with such views, we may notice Alexander von Humboldt, always,
and in all sciences, foremost in the race of generalization. In his
attempt to extend the doctrine of geological equivalents from the
rocks of Europe<a id="fnanchor57-18" href="#note57-18"><span
class="fnanchor">57</span></a> to those of the Andes, he has marked by
appropriate terms the general modes of geological succession. “I have
insisted,” he says<a id="fnanchor58-18" href="#note58-18"><span
class="fnanchor">58</span></a> “principally upon the phenomena of
<i>alternation</i>, <i>oscillation</i>, and <i>local suppression</i>,
and on those presented by the <i>passages</i> of formations from one
to another, by the effect of an <i>interior developement</i>.”</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note57-18"
href="#fnanchor57-18">57</a></span> <i>Gissement des Roches dans les
deux Hemisphères</i>, 1823.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note58-18"
href="#fnanchor58-18">58</a></span> Pref. p. vi.</div>
<p>The phenomena of alternation to which M. de Humboldt here refers
are, in fact, very curious: as exhibiting a mode in which the
transitions from one formation to another may become gradual and
insensible, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page539">539</a></span>
instead of sudden and abrupt. Thus the coal measures in the south of
England are above the mountain limestone; and the distinction of the
formations is of the most marked kind. But as we advance northward
into the coal-field of Yorkshire and Durham, the subjacent limestone
begins to be subdivided by thick masses of sandstone and carbonaceous
strata, and passes into a complex deposit, not distinguishable from
the overlying coal measures; and in this manner the transition from
the limestone to the coal is made by alternation. Thus, to use another
expression of M. de Humboldt’s in ascending from the limestone, the
coal, before we quit the subjacent stratum, <i>preludes</i> to its
fuller exhibition in the superior beds.</p>
<p>Again, as to another point: geologists have gone on up to the
present time endeavoring to discover general laws and facts, with
regard to the position of mountain and mineral masses upon the surface
of the earth. Thus M. Von Buch, in his physical description of the
Canaries, has given a masterly description of the lines of volcanic
action and volcanic products, all over the globe. And, more recently,
M. Elie de Beaumont has offered some generalizations of a still wider
kind. In this new doctrine, those mountain ranges, even in distant
parts of the world, which are of the same age, according to the
classifications already spoken of, are asserted to be parallel<a
id="fnanchor59-18" href="#note59-18"><span
class="fnanchor">59</span></a> to each other, while those ranges which
are of different ages lie in different directions. This very wide and
striking proposition may be considered as being at present upon its
trial among the geologists of Europe.<a id="fnanchor60-18"
href="#note60-18"><span class="fnanchor">60</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note59-18"
href="#fnanchor59-18">59</a></span> We may observe that the notion of
parallelism, when applied to lines drawn on <em>remote</em> portions
of a globular surface, requires to be interpreted in so arbitrary a
manner, that we can hardly imagine it to express a physical law.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note60-18"
href="#fnanchor60-18">60</a></span> Mr. Lyell, in the sixth edition of
his <i>Principles</i>, B. i. c. xii., has combated the hypothesis of
M. Elie de Beaumont, stated in the text. He has argued both against
the catastrophic character of the elevation of mountain chains, and
the parallelism of the contemporaneous ridges. It is evident that the
former doctrine may be true, though the latter be shown to be
false.</div>
<p>Among the organic phenomena, also, which have been the subject of
geological study, general laws of a very wide and comprehensive kind
have been suggested, and in a greater or less degree confirmed by
adequate assemblages of facts. Thus M. Adolphe Brongniart has not
only, in his <i>Fossil Flora</i>, represented and skilfully restored a
vast number of the plants of the ancient world; but he has also, in
the <i>Prodromus</i> of the work, presented various important and
striking views of the general character of the vegetation of former
periods, as <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page540">540</a></span>
insular or continental, tropical or temperate. And M. Agassiz, by the
examination of an incredible number of specimens and collections of
fossil fish, has been led to results which, expressed in terms of his
own ichthyological classification, form remarkable general laws. Thus,
according to him,<a id="fnanchor61-18" href="#note61-18"><span
class="fnanchor">61</span></a> when we go below the lias, we lose all
traces of two of the four orders under which he comprehends all known
kinds of fish; namely, the <i>Cycloïdean</i> and the
<i>Ctenoïdean</i>; while the other two orders, the <i>Ganoïdean</i>
and <i>Placoïdean</i>, rare in our days, suddenly appear in great
numbers, together with large sauroid and carnivorous fishes. Cuvier,
in constructing his great work on ichthyology, transferred to M.
Agassiz the whole subject of fossil fishes, thus showing how highly he
esteemed his talents as a naturalist. And M. Agassiz has shown himself
worthy of his great predecessor in geological natural history, not
only by his acuteness and activity, but by the comprehensive character
of his zoological philosophy, and by the courage with which he has
addressed himself to the vast labors which lie before him. In his
<i>Report on the Fossil Fish discovered in England</i>, published in
1835, he briefly sketches some of the large questions which his
researches have suggested; and then adds,<a id="fnanchor62-18"
href="#note62-18"><span class="fnanchor">62</span></a> “Such is the
meagre outline of a history of the highest interest, full of curious
episodes, but most difficult to relate. To unfold the details which it
contains will be the business of my life.”</p>

<p>[2nd Ed.] [In proceeding downwards through the series of formations
into which geologists have distributed the rocks of the earth, one
class of organic forms after another is found to disappear. In the
Tertiary Period we find all the classes of the present world: Mammals,
Birds, Reptiles, Fishes, Crustaceans, Mollusks, Zoophytes. In the
Secondary Period, from the Chalk down to the New Red Sandstone,
Mammals are not found, with the minute exception of the marsupial
<i>amphitherium</i> and <i>phascolotherium</i> in the Stonesfield
slate. In the Carboniferous and Devonian period we have no large
Reptiles, with, again, a minute amount of exception. In the lower part
of the Silurian rocks, Fishes vanish, and we have no animal forms but
Mollusks, Crustaceans and Zoophytes.</p>
<p>The Carboniferous, Devonian and Silurian formations, thus
containing the oldest forms of life, have been termed
<i>palæozoic</i>. The boundaries of the life-bearing series have not
yet been determined; but the series in which vertebrated animals do
not appear has been <span class="pagenum"><a

and the lower Silurian rocks may probably be looked upon as its upper
members. Below this, geologists place a <i>hypozoic</i> or

<p>Geologists differ as to the question whether these changes in the
inhabitants of the globe were made by determinate steps or by
insensible gradations. M. Agassiz has been led to the conviction that

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Transition to Geological
Dynamics.</i></h4>
<p><span class="sc">While</span> we have been giving this account of
the objects with which Descriptive Geology is occupied, it must have
been felt how difficult it is, in contemplating such facts, to confine
ourselves to description and classification. Conjectures and
reasonings respecting the causes of the phenomena force themselves
upon us at every step; and even influence our classification and
nomenclature. Our Descriptive Geology impels us to endeavor to
construct a Physical Geology. This close connexion of the two branches
of the subject by no means invalidates the necessity of distinguishing
them: as in Botany, although the formation of a Natural System
necessarily brings us to physiological relations, we still distinguish
Systematic from Physiological Botany.</p>
<p>Supposing, however, our Descriptive Geology to be completed, as far
as can be done without considering closely the causes by which the
strata have been produced, we have now to enter upon the other
province of the science, which treats of those causes, and of which we
have already spoken, as <i>Physical Geology</i>. But before we can treat this
department of speculation in a manner suitable to the conditions of
science, and to the analogy of other parts of our knowledge, a certain
intermediate and preparatory science must be formed, of which we shall
now consider the origin and progress.</p>

<span class="sc">Inorganic Geological Dynamics.</span></h3>
<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Necessity and Object of a
Science of Geological Dynamics.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">WHEN</span> the structure and
arrangement which men observed in the materials of the earth
instigated them to speculate concerning the past changes and
revolutions by which such results had been produced, they at first
supposed themselves sufficiently able to judge what would be the
effects of any of the obvious agents of change, as water or volcanic
fire. It did not at once occur to them to suspect, that their common
and extemporaneous judgment on such points was far from sufficient for
sound knowledge;&#8212;they did not foresee that they must create a
special science, whose object should be to estimate the general laws
and effects of assumed causes, before they could pronounce whether
such causes had actually produced the particular facts which their
survey of the earth had disclosed to them.</p>
<p>Yet the analogy of the progress of knowledge on other subjects
points out very clearly the necessity of such a science. When
phenomenal astronomy had arrived at a high point of completeness, by
the labors of ages, and especially by the discovery of Kepler’s laws,
astronomers were vehemently desirous of knowing the causes of these
motions; and sanguine men, such as Kepler, readily conjectured that
the motions were the effects of certain virtues and influences, by
which the heavenly bodies acted upon each other. But it did not at
first occur to him and his fellow-speculators, that they had not
ascertained what motions the influences of one body upon another could
produce: and that, therefore, they were not prepared to judge whether
such causes as they spoke of, did really regulate the motions of the
planets. Yet such was found to be the necessary course of sound
inference. Men needed a science of motion, in order to arrive at a
science of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page543">543</a></span>
heavenly motions: they could not advance in the study of the Mechanics
of the heavens, till they had learned the Mechanics of terrestrial
bodies. And thus they were, in such speculations, at a stand for
nearly a century, from the time of Kepler to the time of Newton, while
the science of Mechanics was formed by Galileo and his successors.
Till that task was executed, all the attempts to assign the causes of
cosmical phenomena were fanciful guesses and vague assertions; after
that was done, they became demonstrations. The science of
<i>Dynamics</i> enabled philosophers to pass securely and completely
from <i>Phenomenal Astronomy</i> to <i>Physical Astronomy</i>.</p>
<p>In like manner, in order that we may advance from Phenomenal
Geology to Physical Geology, we need a science of <i>Geological
Dynamics</i>;&#8212;that is, a science which shall investigate and
determine the laws and consequences of the known causes of changes
such as those which Geology considers:&#8212;and which shall do this,
not in an occasional, imperfect, and unconnected manner, but by
systematic, complete, and conclusive methods;&#8212;shall, in short,
be a Science, and not a promiscuous assemblage of desultory
essays.</p>
<p>The necessity of such a study, as a distinct branch of geology, is
perhaps hardly yet formally recognized, although the researches which
belong to it have, of late years, assumed a much more methodical and
scientific character than they before possessed. Mr. Lyell’s work
(<i>Principles of Geology</i>), in particular, has eminently
contributed to place Geological Dynamics in its proper prominent
position. Of the four books of his Treatise, the second and third are
upon this division of the subject; the second book treating of aqueous
and igneous causes of change, and the third, of changes in the organic
world.</p>
<p>There is no difficulty in separating this auxiliary geological
science from theoretical Geology itself, in which we apply our
principles to the explanation of the actual facts of the earth’s
surface. The former, if perfected, would be a demonstrative science
dealing with general cases; the latter is an ætiological view having
reference to special facts; the one attempts to determine what always
must be under given conditions; the other is satisfied with knowing
what is and has been, and why it has been; the first study has a
strong resemblance to Mechanics, the other to philosophical
Archæology.</p>
<p>Since this portion of science is still so new, it is scarcely
possible to give any historical account of its progress, or any
complete survey of its shape and component parts. I can only attempt a
few notices, <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page544">544</a></span>
which may enable us in some measure to judge to what point this
division of our subject is tending.</p>
<p>We may remark, in this as in former cases, that since we have here
to consider the formation and progress of a <em>science</em>, we must
treat as unimportant preludes to its history, the detached and casual
observations of the effects of causes of change which we find in older
writers. It is only when we come to systematic collections of
information, such as may afford the means of drawing general
conclusions; or to rigorous deductions from known laws of
nature;&#8212;that we can recognise the separate existence of
geological dynamics, as a path of scientific research.</p>
<p>The following may perhaps suffice, for the present, as a sketch of
the subjects of which this science treats:&#8212;the aqueous causes of
change, or those in which water adds to, takes from, or transfers, the
materials of the land:&#8212;the igneous causes; volcanoes, and,
closely connected with them, earthquakes, and the forces by which they
are produced;&#8212;the calculations which determine, on physical
principles, the effects of assumed mechanical causes acting upon large
portions of the crust of the earth;&#8212;the effect of the forces,
whatever they be, which produce the crystalline texture of rocks,
their fissile structure, and the separation of materials, of which we
see the results in metalliferous veins. Again, the estimation of the
results of changes of temperature in the earth, whether operating by
pressure, expansion, or in any other way;&#8212;the effects of assumed
changes in the superficial condition, extent, and elevation, of
terrestrial continents upon the climates of the earth;&#8212;the
effect of assumed cosmical changes upon the temperature of this
planet;&#8212;and researches of the same nature as these.</p>
<p>These researches are concerned with the causes of change in the
inorganic world; but the subject requires no less that we should
investigate the causes which may modify the forms and conditions of
organic things; and in the large sense in which we have to use the
phrase, we may include researches on such subjects also as parts of
Geological Dynamics; although, in truth, this department of physiology
has been cultivated, as it well deserves to be, independently of its
bearing upon geological theories. The great problem which offers
itself here, in reference to Geology, is, to examine the value of any
hypotheses by which it may be attempted to explain the succession of
different races of animals and plants in different strata; and though
it may be difficult, in this inquiry, to arrive at any positive
result, we <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page545">545</a></span> may
at least be able to show the improbability of some conjectures which
have been propounded.</p>
<p>I shall now give a very brief account of some of the attempts made
in these various departments of this province of our knowledge; and in
the present chapter, of Inorganic Changes.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Aqueous Causes of Change.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> controversies to which
the various theories of geologists gave rise, proceeding in various
ways upon the effects of the existing causes of change, led men to
observe, with some attention and perseverance, the actual operation of
such causes. In this way, the known effect of the Rhine, in filling up
the Lake of Geneva at its upper extremity, was referred to by De Luc,
Kirwan, and others, in their dispute with the Huttonians; and attempts
were even made to calculate how distant the period was, when this
alluvial deposit first began. Other modern observers have attended to
similar facts in the natural history of rivers and seas. But the
subject may be considered as having first assumed its proper form,
when taken up by Mr. Von Hoff; of whose <i>History of the Natural
Changes of the Earth’s surface which are proved by Tradition</i>, the
first part, treating of aqueous changes, appeared in 1822. This work
was occasioned by a Prize Question of the Royal Society of Göttingen,
promulgated in 1818; in which these changes were proposed as the
subject of inquiry, with a special reference to geology. Although Von
Hoff does not attempt to establish any general inductions upon the
facts which his book contains, the collection of such a body of facts
gave almost a new aspect to the subject, by showing that changes in
the relative extent of land and water were going on at every time, and
almost at every place; and that mutability and fluctuation in the form
of the solid parts of the earth, which had been supposed by most
persons to be a rare exception to the common course of events, was, in
fact, the universal rule. But it was Mr. Lyell’s <i>Principles of
Geology, being an attempt to explain the former Changes of the Earth’s
Surface by the Causes now in action</i> (of which the first volume was
published in 1830), which disclosed the full effect of such researches
on geology; and which attempted to present such assemblages of special
facts, as examples of general laws. Thus this work may, as we have
said, be looked upon as the beginning of Geological Dynamics, at least
among us. Such generalizations and applications as it contains give
the most lively <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page546">546</a></span>
interest to a thousand observations respecting rivers and floods,
mountains and morasses, which otherwise appear without aim or meaning;
and thus this department of science cannot fail to be constantly
augmented by contributions from every side. At the same time it is
clear, that these contributions, voluminous as they must become, must,
from time to time, be resolved into laws of greater and greater
generality; and that thus alone the progress of this, as of all other
sciences, can be furthered.</p>
<p>I need not attempt any detailed enumeration of the modes of aqueous
action which are here to be considered. Some are destructive, as when
the rivers erode the channels in which they flow; or when the waves,
by their perpetual assault, shatter the shores, and carry the ruins of
them into the abyss of the ocean. Some operations of the water, on the
other hand, add to the land; as when <i>deltas</i> are formed at the
mouths of rivers or when calcareous springs form deposits of
<i>travertin</i>. Even when bound in icy fetters, water is by no mean
deprived of its active power; the <i>glacier</i> carries into the
valley masses of its native mountain, and often, becoming ice-bergs,
float with a lading of such materials far into the seas of the
temperate zone. It is indisputable that vast beds of worn down
fragments of the existing land are now forming into strata at the
bottom of the ocean; and that many other effects are constantly
produced by existing aqueous causes, which resemble some, at least, of
the facts which geology has to explain.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [The effects of glaciers above mentioned are obvious; but
the mechanism of these bodies,&#8212;the mechanical cause of their
motions,&#8212;was an unsolved problem till within a very few years.
That they slide as rigid masses;&#8212;that they advance by the
expansion of their mass;&#8212;that they advance as a collection of
rigid fragments; were doctrines which were held by eminent physicists;
though a very slight attention to the subject shows these opinions to
be untenable. In Professor James Forbes’s theory on the subject
(published in his <i>Travels through the Alps</i>, 1843,) we find a
solution of the problem, so simple, and yet so exact, as to produce
the most entire conviction. In this theory, the ice of a glacier is,
on a great scale, supposed to be a plastic or viscous mass, though
small portions of it are sensibly rigid. It advances down the slope of
the valley in which it lies as a plastic mass would do, accommodating
itself to the varying shape and size of its bed, and showing by its
crevasses its mixed character between fluid and rigid. It shows this
character still more curiously by a <i>ribboned</i> <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page547">547</a></span> <i>structure</i> on a
small scale, which is common in the solid ice of the glacier. The
planes of these <i>ribbons</i> are, for the most part, at right angles
to the crevasses, near the sides of the glacier, while, near its
central line, they <i>dip</i> towards the upper part of the glacier.
This structure appears to arise from the difference of velocities of
contiguous moving filaments of the icy mass, as the crevasses
themselves arise from the tension of larger portions. Mr. Forbes has,
in successive publications, removed the objections which have been
urged against this theory. In the last of them, a Memoir in the
<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1846, (<i>Illustrations of the Viscous Theory of
Glacier Motion</i>,) he very naturally expresses astonishment at the
opposition which has been made to the theory on the ground of the
rigidity of small pieces of ice. He has himself shown that the ice of
glaciers has a plastic flexibility, by marking forty-five points in a
transverse straight line upon the Mer de Glace, and observing them for
several days. The straight line in that time not only became oblique
to the side, but also became visibly curved.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Forbes and other philosophers have made it in the highest
degree probable that glaciers have existed in many places in which
they now exist no longer, and have exercised great powers in
transporting large blocks of rock, furrowing and polishing the rocks
along which they slide, and leaving lines and masses of detritus or
<i>moraine</i> which they had carried along with them or pushed before
them. It cannot be doubted that extinct glaciers have produced some of
the effects which the geologist has to endeavor to explain. But this
part of the machinery of nature has been worked by some theorists into
an exaggerated form, in which it cannot, as I conceive, have any place
in an account of Geological Dynamics which aims at being
permanent.</p>
<p>The great problem of the diffusion of drift and erratic blocks from
their parent rocks to great distances, has driven geologists to the
consideration of other hypothetical machinery by which the effects may
be accounted for: especially the great <i>northern drift</i> and
<i>boulders</i>,&#8212;the rocks from the Scandinavian chain which
cover the north of Europe on a vast area, having a length of 2000 and
breadth of from 400 to 800 miles. The diffusion of these blocks has
been accounted for by supposing them to be imbedded in icebergs,
detached from the shore, and floated into oceanic spaces, where they
have grounded and been deposited by the melting of the ice. And this
mode of action may to some extent be safely admitted into geological
speculation. For it is a matter of fact, that our navigators in arctic
and antarctic regions have <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page548">548</a></span> repeatedly seen icebergs and icefloes
sailing along laden with such materials.</p>
<p>The above explanation of the phenomena of drift supposes the land
on which the travelled materials are found to have been the bottom of
a sea where they were deposited. But it does not, even granting the
conditions, account for some of the facts observed;&#8212;that the
drift and the boulders are deposited in “trainées” or streaks, which,
in direction, diverge from the parent rock;&#8212;and that the
boulders are of smaller and smaller size, as they are found more
remote from that centre. These phenomena rather suggest the notion of
currents of water as the cause of the distribution of the materials
into their present situations. And though the supposition that the
whole area occupied by drift and boulders was a sea-bottom when they
were scattered over it much reduces the amount of violence which it is
necessary to assume in order to distribute the loose masses, yet still
the work appears to be beyond the possible effect of ordinary marine
currents, or any movements which would be occasioned by a slow and
gradual rising of the centre of distribution.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that a <em>sudden</em> rise of the centre of
distribution would cause a motion in the surrounding ocean sufficient
to produce such an effect: and in confirmation of this reference has
been made to Mr. Scott Russell’s investigations with respect to waves,
already referred to. (<a href="#v1page351">Book <span
class="sc">viii</span></a>.) The wave in this case would be the <i>wave
of translation</i>, in which the motion of the water is as great at the
bottom as at the top; and it has hence been asserted that by
paroxysmal elevations of 100 or 200 feet, a current of 25 or 30 miles
an hour might be accounted for. But I think it has not been
sufficiently noted that at each point this “current” is transient: it
lasts only while the wave is passing over the point, and therefore it
would only either carry a single mass the whole way with its own
velocity, or move through a short distance a series of masses over
which it successively passed. It does not appear, therefore, that we
have here a complete account of the transport of a collection of
materials, in which each part is transferred through great
distances:&#8212;except, indeed, we were to suppose a numerous
succession of paroxysmal elevations. Such a <em>battery</em> might, by
successive shocks, transmitting their force through the water, diffuse
the fragments of the central mass over any area, however wide.</p>
<p>The fact that the erratic blocks are found to rest on the lower
drift, is well explained by supposing the latter to have been spread
on the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page549">549</a></span> sea
bottom while rock-bearing ice-masses floated on the surface till they
deposited their lading.</p>
<p>Sir R. Murchison has pointed out another operation of ice in
producing mounds of rocky masses; namely, the effects of rivers and
lakes, in climates where, as in Russia, the waters carry rocky
fragments entangled in the winter ice, and leave them in heaps at the
highest level which the waters attain.</p>
<p>The extent to which the effects of glaciers, now vanished, are
apparent in many places, especially in Switzerland and in England, and
other phenomena of the like tendency, have led some of the most
eminent geologists to the conviction that, interior to the period of
our present temperature, there was a <i>Glacial Period</i>, at which
the temperature of Europe was lower than it now is.]</p>
<p>Although the study of the common operations of water may give the
geologist such an acquaintance with the laws of his subject as may
much aid his judgment respecting the extent to which such effects may
proceed, a long course of observation and thought must be requisite
before such operations can be analysed into their fundamental
principles, and become the subjects of calculation, or of rigorous
reasoning in any manner which is as precise and certain as
calculation. Various portions of Hydraulics have an important bearing
upon these subjects, including some researches which have been pursued
with no small labor by engineers and mathematicians; as the effects of
currents and waves, the laws of tides and of rivers, and many similar
problems. In truth, however, such subjects have not hitherto been
treated by mathematicians with much success; and probably several
generations must elapse before this portion of geological dynamics can
become an exact science.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Igneous Causes of Change.&#8212;Motions
of the Earth’s Surface.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> effects of volcanoes have
long been noted as important and striking features in the physical
history of our globe; and the probability of their connexion with many
geological phenomena, had not escaped notice at an early period. But
it was not till more recent times, that the full import of these
phenomena was apprehended. The person who first looked at such
operations with that commanding general view which showed their
extensive connexion with physical geology, was Alexander von Humboldt,
who explored the volcanic phenomena <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page550">550</a></span> of the New World, from 1799 to 1804. He
remarked<a id="fnanchor64-18" href="#note64-18"><span
class="fnanchor">64</span></a> the linear distribution of volcanic
domes, considering them as vents placed along the edge of vast
fissures communicating with reservoirs of igneous matter, and
extending across whole continents. He observed, also, the frequent
sympathy of volcanic and terremotive action in remote districts of the
earth’s surface, thus showing how deeply seated must be the cause of
these convulsions. These views strongly excited and influenced the
speculations of geologists; and since then, phenomena of this kind
have been collected into a general view as parts of a
natural-historical science. Von Hoff, in the second volume of the work
already <a href="#v2page545">mentioned</a>, was one of the first who
did this; “At least,” he himself says,<a id="fnanchor65-18"
href="#note65-18"><span class="fnanchor">65</span></a> (1824,) “it was
not known to him that any one before him had endeavored to combine so
large a mass of facts with the general ideas of the natural
philosopher, so as to form a whole.” Other attempts were, however,
soon made. In 1825, M. von Ungern-Sternberg published his book <i>On
the Nature and Origin of Volcanoes</i>,<a id="fnanchor66-18"
href="#note66-18"><span class="fnanchor">66</span></a> in which, he
says, his object is, to give an empirical representation of these
phenomena. In the same year, Mr. Poulett Scrope published a work in
which he described the known facts of volcanic action; not, however,
confining himself to description; his purpose being, as his title
states, to consider “the probable causes of their phenomena, the laws
which determine their march, the disposition of their products, and
their connexion with the present state and past history of the globe;
leading to the establishment of a new theory of the earth.” And in
1826, Dr. Daubeny, of Oxford, produced <i>A Description of Active</i>
and Extinct <i>Volcanoes</i>, including in the latter phrase the
volcanic rocks of central France, of the Rhine, of northern and
central Italy, and many other countries. Indeed, the near connexion
between the volcanic effects now going on, and those by which the
basaltic rocks of Auvergne and many other places had been produced,
was, by this time, no longer doubted by any; and therefore the line
which here separates the study of existing causes from that of past
effects may seem to melt away. But yet it is manifest that the
assumption of an identity of scale and mechanism between volcanoes now
active, and the igneous catastrophes of which the products have <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page551">551</a></span> survived great
revolutions on the earth’s surface, is hypothetical; and all which
depends on this assumption belongs to theoretical geology.</p>

<p>Confining ourselves, then, to volcanic effects, which have been
produced, certainly or probably, since the earth’s surface assumed its
present form, we have still an ample exhibition of powerful causes of
change, in the streams of lava and other materials emitted in
eruptions; and still more in the earthquakes which, as men easily
satisfied themselves, are produced by the same causes as the eruptions
of volcanic fire.</p>
<p>Mr. Lyell’s work was important in this as in other portions of this
subject. He extended the conceptions previously entertained of the
effects which such causes may produce, not only by showing how great
these operations are historically known to have been, and how
constantly they are going on, if we take into our survey the whole
surface of the earth; but still more, by urging the consequences which
would follow in a long course of time from the constant repetition of
operations in themselves of no extraordinary amount. A lava-stream
many miles long and wide, and several yards deep, a subsidence or
elevation of a portion of the earth’s surface of a few feet, are by no
means extraordinary facts. Let these operations, said Mr. Lyell, be
repeated thousands of times; and we have results of the same order
with the changes which geology discloses.</p>
<p>The most mitigated earthquakes have, however, a character of
violence. But it has been thought by many philosophers that there is
evidence of a change of level of the land in cases where none of these
violent operations are going on. The most celebrated of these cases is
Sweden; the whole of the land from Gottenburg to the north of the Gulf
of Bothnia has been supposed in the act of rising, slowly and
insensibly, from the surrounding waters. The opinion of such a change
of level has long been the belief of the inhabitants; and was
maintained by Celsius in the beginning of the eighteenth century. It
has since been conceived to be confirmed by various observations of
marks cut on the face of the rock; beds of shells, such as now live in
the neighboring seas, raised to a considerable height; and other
indications. Some of these proofs appear doubtful; but Mr. Lyell,
after examining the facts upon the spot in 1834, says, “In regard to
the proposition that the land, in certain parts of Sweden, is
gradually rising, I have no hesitation in assenting to it, after my
visit to the districts above alluded to.”<a id="fnanchor67-18"
href="#note67-18"><span class="fnanchor">67</span></a> If this
conclusion be generally accepted by <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page552">552</a></span> geologists, we have here a daily example
of the operation of some powerful agent which belongs to geological
dynamics; and which, for the purposes of the geological theorist, does
the work of the earthquake upon a very large scale, without assuming
its terrors.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note67-18"
href="#fnanchor67-18">67</a></span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1835, p.
32.</div>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [Examples of changes of level of large districts
occurring at periods when the country has been agitated by earthquakes
are well ascertained, as the rising of the coast of Chili in 1822, and
the subsidence of the district of Cutch, in the delta of the Indus, in
1819. (Lyell, B. <span class="sc">ii</span>. c. xv.) But the cases of
more slow and tranquil movement seem also to be established. The
gradual secular rise of the shore of the Baltic, mentioned in the
text, has been confirmed by subsequent investigation. It appears that
the rate of elevation increases from Stockholm, where it is only a few
inches in a century, to the North Cape, where it is several feet. It
appears also that several other regions are in a like state of secular
change. The coast of Greenland is sinking. (Lyell, B. <span
class="sc">ii</span>. c. xviii.) And the existence of “raised beaches”
along various coasts is now generally accepted among geologists. Such
beaches, anciently forming the margin of the sea, but now far above
it, exist in many places; for instance, along a great part of the
Scotch coast; and among the raised beaches of that country we ought
probably, with Mr. Darwin, to include the “parallel roads” of Glenroy,
the subject, in former days, of so much controversy among geologists
and antiquaries.</p>
<p>Connected with the secular rise and fall of large portions of the
earth’s surface, another agency which plays an important part in
Geological dynamics has been the subject of some bold yet singularly
persuasive speculations by Mr. Darwin. I speak of the formation of
Coral, and Coral Reefs. He says that the coral-building animal works
only at small and definite distances below the surface. How then are
we to account for the vast number of coral islands, rings, and reefs,
which are scattered over the Pacific and Indian Oceans! Can we suppose
that there are so many mountains, craters, and ridges, all exactly
within a few feet of the same height through this vast portion of the
globe’s surface? This is incredible. How then are we to explain the
facts? Mr. Darwin replies, that if we suppose the land to subside
slowly beneath the sea, and at the same time suppose the coralline
zoophytes to go on building, so that their structure constantly rises
nearly to the surface of the water, we shall have the facts explained.
A submerged island will produce a ring; a long coast, a barrier reef;
and so on. Mr. Darwin also notes other phenomena, as <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page553">553</a></span> elevated beds of
coral, which, occurring in other places, indicate a recent rising of
the land; and on such grounds as these he divides the surface of those
parts of the ocean into regions of elevation and of depression.</p>
<p>The labors of coralline zoophytes, as thus observed, form masses of
coral, such as are found fossilized in the strata of the earth. But
our knowledge of the laws of life which have probably affected the
distribution of marine remains in strata, has received other very
striking accessions by the labors of Prof. Edward Forbes in observing
the marine animals of the Ægean Sea. He found that, even in their
living state, the mollusks and zoophytes are already distributed into
strata. Dividing the depth into eight regions, from 2 to 230 fathoms,
he found that each region had its peculiar inhabitants, which
disappeared speedily either in ascending or in descending. The zero of
animal life appeared to occur at about 300 fathoms. This curious
result bears in various ways upon geology. Mr. Forbes himself has
given an example of the mode in which it may be applied, by
determining the depth at which the submarine eruption took place which
produced the volcanic isle of Neokaimeni in 1707. By an examination of
the fossils embedded in the pumice, he showed that it came from the
fourth region.<a id="fnanchor68-18" href="#note68-18"><span
class="fnanchor">68</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note68-18"

<p>To the modes in which organized beings operate in producing the
materials of the earth, we must add those pointed out by the
extraordinary microscopic discoveries of Professor Ehrenberg. It
appears that whole beds of earthy matter consist of the cases of
certain infusoria, the remains of these creatures being accumulated in
numbers which it confounds our thoughts to contemplate.]</p>
<p>Speculations concerning the <em>causes</em> of volcanoes and
earthquakes, and of the rising and sinking of land, are a highly
important portion of this science, at least as far as the calculation
of the possible results of definite causes is concerned. But the
various hypotheses which have been propounded on this subject can
hardly be considered as sufficiently matured for such calculation. A
mass of matter in a state of igneous fusion, extending to the centre
of the earth, even if we make such an hypothesis, requires some
additional cause to produce eruption. The supposition that this fire
may be produced by intense chemical action between combining elements,
requires further, not only some agency to bring together such
elements, but some reason why <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page554">554</a></span> they should be originally separate. And
if any other causes have been suggested, as electricity or magnetism,
this has been done so vaguely as to elude all possibility of rigorous
deduction from the hypothesis. The doctrine of a Central Heat,
however, has occupied so considerable a place in theoretical geology,
that it ought undoubtedly to form an article in geological
dynamics.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 4.&#8212;<i>The Doctrine of Central Heat.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> early geological
theorists who, like Leibnitz and Buffon, assumed that the earth was
originally a mass in a state of igneous fusion, naturally went on to
deduce from this hypothesis, that the crust consolidated and cooled
before the interior, and that there might still remain a central heat,
capable of producing many important effects. But it is in more recent
times that we have measures of such effects, and calculations which we
can compare with measures. It was found, as we have said, that in
descending below the surface of the earth, the temperature of its
materials increased. Now it followed from Fourier’s mathematical
investigations of the distribution of heat in the earth, that if there
be no primitive heat (<i>chaleur d’origine</i>), the temperature, when
we descend below the crust, will be constant in each vertical line.
Hence an observed increase of temperature in descending, appeared to
point out a central heat resulting from some cause now no longer in
action.</p>
<p>The doctrine of a central heat has usually been combined with the
supposition of a central igneous fluidity; for the heat in the
neighborhood of the centre must be very intense, according to any law
of its increase in descending which is consistent with known
principles. But to this central fluidity it has been objected that
such a fluid must be in constant circulation by the cooling of its
exterior. Mr. Daniell found this to be the case in all fused metals.
It has also been objected that there must be, in such a central fluid,
<i>tides</i> produced by the moon and sun; but this inference would
require several additional suppositions and calculations to give it a
precise form.</p>
<p>Again, the supposition of a central heat of the earth, considered
as the effect of a more ancient state of its mass, appeared to
indicate that its cooling must still be going on. But if this were so,
the earth might contract, as most bodies do when they cool; and this
contraction might lead to mechanical results, as the shortening of the
day. Laplace satisfied himself, by reference to ancient astronomical
records, that no such <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page555">555</a></span> alteration in the length of the day had
taken place, even to the amount of one two-hundredth of a second; and
thus, there was here no confirmation of the hypothesis of a primitive
heat of the earth.</p>
<p>Though we find no evidence of the secular contraction of the earth
in the observations with which astronomy deals, there are some
geological facts which at first appear to point to the reality of a
refrigeration within geological periods; as the existence of the
remains of plants and shells of tropical climates, in the strata of
countries which are now near to or within the frigid zones. These
facts, however, have given rise to theories of the changes of climate,
which we must consider separately.</p>
<p>But we may notice, as connected with the doctrine of central heat,
the manner in which this hypothesis has been applied to explain
volcanic and geological phenomena. It does not enter into my plan, to
consider explanations in which this central heat is supposed to give
rise to an expansive force,<a id="fnanchor69-18"
href="#note69-18"><span class="fnanchor">69</span></a> without any
distinct reference to known physical laws. But we may notice; as more
likely to become useful materials of the science now before us, such
speculations as those of Mr. Babbage; in which he combines the
doctrine of central heat with other physical laws;<a
id="fnanchor70-18" href="#note70-18"><span
class="fnanchor">70</span></a> as, that solid rocks <i>expand</i> by
being heated, but that clay contracts; that different rocks and strata
<i>conduct</i> heat differently; that the earth <i>radiates</i> heat
differently, or at different parts of its surface, according as it is
covered with forests, with mountains, with deserts, or with water.
These principles, applied to large masses, such as those which
constitute the crust of the earth, might give rise to changes as great
as any which geology discloses. For example: when the bed of a sea is
covered by a thick deposit of new matter worn from the shores, the
strata below the bed, being protected by a bad conductor of heat, will
be heated, and, being heated, maybe expanded; or, as Sir J. Herschel
has observed, may produce explosion by the conversion of their
moisture into steam. Such speculations, when founded on real data and
sound calculations, may hereafter be of material use in geology.</p>

<p>The doctrine of central heat and fluidity has been rejected by some
eminent philosophers. Mr. Lyell’s reasons for this rejection belong
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page556">556</a></span> rather to
Theoretical Geology; but I may here notice M. <span class="correction"
title="emended from Poissons">Poisson’s</span> opinion. He does not
assent to the conclusion of Fourier, that once the temperature
increases in descending, there must be some primitive central heat. On
the contrary, he considers that such an increase may arise from
this;&#8212;that the earth, at some former period, passed (by the
motion of the solar system in the universe,) <span class="correction"
title="emended from though">through</span> a portion of space which
was warmer than the space in which it now revolves (by reason, it may
be, of the heat of other stars to which it was then nearer). He
supposes that, since such a period, the surface has cooled down by the
influence of the surrounding circumstances; while the interior, for a
certain unknown depth, retains the trace of the former elevation of
temperature. But this assumption is not likely to expel the belief is
the terrestrial origin of the subterraneous heat. For the supposition
of such an inequality in the temperature of the different regions in
which the solar system is placed at different times, is altogether
arbitrary; and, if pushed to the amount to which it must be carried,
in order to account for the phenomenon, is highly improbable.<a
id="fnanchor71-18" href="#note71-18"><span
class="fnanchor">71</span></a> The doctrine of central heat, on the
other hand, (which need not be conceived as implying the
<em>universal</em> fluidity of the mass,) is not only naturally
suggested by the subterraneous increase of temperatures, but explains
the spheroidal figure of the earth; and falls in with almost any
theory which can be devised, of volcanoes, earthquakes, and great
geological changes.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note71-18"
href="#fnanchor71-18">71</a></span> For this hypothesis would make it
necessary to suppose that the earth has, at some former period,
derived from some other star or stars more heat than she now derives
from the sun. But this would imply, as highly probable, that at some
period some other star or stars must have produced also a
<em>mechanical</em> effect upon the solar system, greater than the
effect of the sun. Now such a past operation of forces, fitted to
obliterate all order and symmetry, is quite inconsistent with the
simple, regular, and symmetrical relation which the whole solar
system, as far as Uranus, bears to the present central body.</div>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 5.&#8212;<i>Problems respecting Elevations and
Crystalline Forces.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Other</span> problems respecting the
forces by which great masses of the earth’s crust have been displaced,
have also been solved by various mathematicians. It has been
maintained by Von Buch that there occur, in various places, <i>craters
of elevation</i>; that is, mountain-masses resembling the craters of
volcanoes, but really produced by an expansive force from below,
bursting an aperture through horizontal strata, <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page557">557</a></span> and elevating them in
a conical form. Against this doctrine, as exemplified in the most
noted instances, strong arguments have been adduced by other
geologists. Yet the protrusion of fused rock by subterraneous forces
upon a large scale is not denied: and how far the examples of such
operations may, in any cases, be termed craters of elevation, must be
considered as a question not yet decided. On the supposition of the
truth of Von Buch’s doctrine, M. de Beaumont has calculated the
relations of position, the fissures, &amp;c., which would arise. And
Mr. Hopkins,<a id="fnanchor72-18" href="#note72-18"><span
class="fnanchor">72</span></a> of Cambridge, has investigated in a
much more general manner, upon mechanical principles, the laws of the
elevations, fissures, faults, veins, and other phenomena which would
result from an elevatory force, acting simultaneously at every point
beneath extensive portions of the crust of the earth. An application
of mathematical reasoning to the illustration of the phenomena of
veins had before been made in Germany by Schmidt and Zimmerman.<a
id="fnanchor73-18" href="#note73-18"><span
class="fnanchor">73</span></a> The conclusion which Mr. Hopkins has
obtained, respecting the two sets of fissures, at right angles to each
other, which would in general be produced by such forces as he
supposes, may suggest interesting points of examination respecting the
geological phenomena of fissured districts.</p>

<p>[2nd Ed.] [The theory of craters of elevation probably errs rather
by making the elevation of a point into a particular class of volcanic
agency, than by giving volcanic agency too great a power of
elevation.</p>
<p>A mature consideration of the subject will make us hesitate to
ascribe much value to the labors of those writers who have applied
mathematical reasoning to geological questions. Such reasoning, when
it is carried to the extent which requires symbolical processes, has
always been, I conceive, a source, not of knowledge, but of error, and
confusion; for in such applications the real questions are slurred
over in the hypothetical assumptions of the mathematician, while the
calculation misleads its followers by a false aspect of demonstration.
All symbolical reasonings concerning the fissures of a semi-rigid mass
produced by elevatory or other forces, appear to me to have turned out
valueless. At the same time it cannot be too strongly borne in mind,
that mathematical and mechanical habits of thought are requisite to
all clear thinking on such subjects.]</p>
<p>Other forces, still more secure in their nature and laws, have
played a very important part in the formation of the earth’s crust. I
speak of the forces by which the crystalline, slaty, and jointed
structure of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page558">558</a></span>
mineral masses has been produced. These forces are probably identical,
on the one hand, with the cohesive forces from which rocks derive
their solidity and their physical properties; while, on the other
hand, they are closely connected with the forces of chemical
attraction. No attempts, of any lucid and hopeful kind, have yet been
made to bring such forces under definite mechanical conceptions: and
perhaps mineralogy, to which science, as the point of junction of
chemistry and crystallography, such attempts would belong, is hardly
yet ripe for such speculations. But when we look at the universal
prevalence of crystalline forms and cleavages, at the extent of the
phenomena of slaty cleavage, and at the <em>segregation</em> of
special minerals into veins and nodules, which has taken place in some
unknown manner, we cannot doubt that the forces of which we now speak
have acted very widely and energetically. Any elucidation of their
nature would be an important step in Geological Dynamics.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [A point of Geological Dynamics of great importance is,
the change which rocks undergo in structure after they are deposited,
either by the action of subterraneous heat, or by the influence of
crystalline or other corpuscular forces. By such agencies, sedimentary
rocks may be converted into crystalline, the traces of organic fossils
may be obliterated, a slaty cleavage may be produced, and other like
effects. The possibility of such changes was urged by Dr. Hutton in
his Theory; and Sir James Hall’s very instructive and striking
experiments were made for the purpose of illustrating this theory. In
these experiments, powdered chalk was, by the application of heat
under pressure, converted into crystalline calcspar. Afterwards Dr.
McCulloch’s labors had an important influence in satisfying geologists
of the reality of corresponding changes in nature. Dr. McCulloch, by
his very lively and copious descriptions of volcanic regions, by his
representations of them, by his classification of igneous rocks, and
his comprehensive views of the phenomena which they exhibit, probably
was the means of converting many geologists from the Wernerian
opinions.</p>
<p>Rocks which have undergone changes since they were deposited are
termed by Mr. Lyell <i>metamorphic</i>. The great extent of
metamorphic rock changed by heat is now uncontested. The internal
changes which are produced by the crystalline forces of mountain
masses have been the subjects of important and comprehensive
speculations by Professor Sedgwick.] <span class="pagenum"><a

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 6.&#8212;<i>Theories of Changes of Climate.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">As</span> we have already stated,
Geology offers to us strong evidence that the climate of the ancient
periods of the earth’s history was hotter than that which now exists
in the same countries. This, and other circumstances, have led
geologists to the investigation of the effects of any hypothetical
causes of such changes of condition in respect of heat.</p>
<p>The love of the contemplation of geometrical symmetry, as well as
other reasons, suggested the hypothesis that the earth’s axis had
originally no obliquity, but was perpendicular to the equator. Such a
construction of the world had been thought of before the time of
Milton,<a id="fnanchor74-18" href="#note74-18"><span
class="fnanchor">74</span></a> as what might be supposed to have
existed when man was expelled from Paradise; and Burnet, in his
<i>Sacred Theory of the Earth</i> (1690), adopted this notion of the
paradisiacal condition of the globe:</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;The spring</span><br />

Lost</i>, x. 214.</span><br />
</div></div></div>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<p>In modern times, too, some persons have been disposed to adopt this
hypothesis, because they have conceived that the present polar
distribution of light is inconsistent with the production of the
fossil plants which are found in those regions,<a id="fnanchor75-18"
href="#note75-18"><span class="fnanchor">75</span></a> even if we
could, in some other way, account for the change of temperature. But
this alteration in the axes of a revolution could not take place
without a subversion of the equilibrium of the surface, such as does
not appear to have occurred; and the change has of late been generally
declared impossible by physical astronomers.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note75-18"
href="#fnanchor75-18">75</a></span> Lyell, i. 155. Lindley, <i>Fossil
Flora</i>.</div>
<p>The effects of other astronomical changes have been calculated by
Sir John Herschel. He has examined, for instance, the thermotical
consequences of the diminution of the eccentricity of the earth’s
orbit, which has been going on for ages beyond the records of history.
He finds<a id="fnanchor76-18" href="#note76-18"><span
class="fnanchor">76</span></a> that, on this account, the annual
effect of solar radiation would increase as we go back to remoter
periods of the past; but (probably at least) not in a degree
sufficient to account for the apparent past <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page560">560</a></span> changes of climate. He finds, however,
that though the effect of this change on the mean temperature of the
year may be small, the effect on the extreme temperature of the
seasons will be much more considerable; “so as to produce alternately,
in the same latitude of either hemisphere, a perpetual spring, or the
extreme vicissitudes of a burning summer and a rigorous winter.”<a

<p>Mr. Lyell has traced the consequences of another hypothesis on this
subject, which appears at first sight to promise no very striking
results, but which yet is found, upon examination, to involve adequate
causes of very great changes: I refer to the supposed various
distribution of land and water at different periods of the earth’s
history. If the land were all gathered into the neighborhood of the
poles, it would become the seat of constant ice and snow, and would
thus very greatly reduce the temperature of the whole surface of the
globe. If, on the other hand, the polar regions were principally
water, while the tropics were occupied with a belt of land, there
would be no part of the earth’s surface on which the frost could
fasten a firm hold, while the torrid zone would act like a furnace to
heat the whole. And, supposing a cycle of terrestrial changes in which
these conditions should succeed each other, the winter and summer of
this “great year” might differ much more than the elevated temperature
which we are led to ascribe to former periods of the globe, can be
judged to have differed from the present state of things.</p>
<p>The ingenuity and plausibility of this theory cannot be doubted:
and perhaps its results may hereafter be found not quite out of the
reach of calculation. Some progress has already been made in
calculating the movement of heat into, through, and out of the earth;
but when we add to this the effects of the currents of the ocean and
the atmosphere, the problem, thus involving so many thermotical and
atmological laws, operating under complex conditions, is undoubtedly
one of extreme difficulty. Still, it is something, in this as in all
cases, to have the problem even stated; and none of the elements of
the solution appears to be of such a nature that we need allow
ourselves to yield to despair, respecting the possibility of dealing
with it in a useful manner, as our knowledge becomes more complete and
definite. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page561">561</a></span></p>

<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Objects of this
Science.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">PERHAPS</span> in extending the term
<i>Geological Dynamics</i> to the causes of changes in organized
beings, I shall be thought to be employing a forced and inconvenient
phraseology. But it will be found that, in order to treat geology in a
truly scientific manner, we must bring together all the classes of
speculations concerning known causes of change; and the Organic
Dynamics of Geology, or of Geography, if the reader prefers the word,
appears not an inappropriate phrase for one part of this body of
researches.</p>
<p>As has already been said, the species of plants and animals which
are found embedded in the strata of the earth, are not only different
from those which now live in the same regions, but, for the most part,
different from any now existing on the face of the earth. The remains
which we discover imply a past state of things different from that
which now prevails; they imply also that the whole organic creation
has been renewed, and that this renewal has taken place several times.
Such extraordinary general facts have naturally put in activity very
bold speculations.</p>
<p>But it has already been said, we cannot speculate upon such facts
in the past history of the globe, without taking a large survey of its
present condition. Does the present animal and vegetable population
differ from the past, in the same way in which the products of one
region of the existing earth differ from those of another? Can the
creation and diffusion of the fossil species be explained in the same
manner as the creation and diffusion of the creatures among which we
live? And these questions lead us onwards another step, to
ask,&#8212;What <em>are</em> the laws by which the plants and animals
of different parts of the earth differ? What was the manner in which
they were originally diffused?&#8212;Thus we have to include, as
portions of our subject, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page562">562</a></span> the <i>Geography of Plants</i>, and
<i>of Animals</i>, and the <i>History of their change and
diffusion</i>; intending by the latter subject, of course,
<i>palætiological</i> history,&#8212;the examination of the causes of
what has occurred, and the inference of past events, from what we know
of causes.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary for me to give at any length a statement of the
problems which are included in these branches of science, or of the
progress which has been made in them; since Mr. Lyell, in his
<i>Principles of Geology</i>, has treated these subjects in a very
able manner, and in the same point of view in which I am thus led to
consider them. I will only briefly refer to some points, availing
myself of his labors and his ideas.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Geography of Plants and Animals.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">With</span> regard both to plants
and animals, it appears,<a id="fnanchor78-18" href="#note78-18"><span
class="fnanchor">78</span></a> that besides such differences in the
products of different regions as we may naturally suppose to be
occasioned by climate and other external causes; an examination of the
whole organic population of the globe leads us to consider the earth
as divided into <i>provinces</i>, each province being occupied by its
own group of species, and these groups not being mixed or interfused
among each other to any great extent. And thus, as the earth is
occupied by various nations of men, each appearing at first sight to
be of a different stock, so each other tribe of living things is
scattered over the ground in a similar manner, and distributed into
its separate <i>nations</i> in distant countries. The places where
species are thus peculiarly found, are, in the case of plants, called
their <i>stations</i>. Yet each species in its own region loves and
selects some peculiar conditions of shade or exposure, soil or
moisture: its place, defined by the general description of such
conditions, is called its <i>habitation</i>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note78-18"
href="#fnanchor78-18">78</a></span> Lyell, <i>Principles</i>, B. iii.
c. v.</div>
<p>Not only each species thus placed in its own province, has its
position further fixed by its own habits, but more general groups and
assemblages are found to be determined in their situation by more
general conditions. Thus it is the character of the <i>flora</i> of a
collection of islands, scattered through a wide ocean in a tropical
and humid climate, to contain an immense preponderance of tree-ferns.
In the same way, the situation and depth at which certain genera of
shells are found have been tabulated<a id="fnanchor79-18"
href="#note79-18"><span class="fnanchor">79</span></a> by Mr.
Broderip. Such general inferences, if <span class="pagenum"><a

extreme interest in their bearing on geological speculations.</p>

<p>But, besides the fortunes of individual plants and animals, there
is another class of questions, of great interest, but of great
difficulty;&#8212;the fortunes of each species. In what manner do
species which were not, begin to be? as geology teaches us that they
many times have done; and, as even our own reasonings convince us they
must have done, at least in the case of the species among which we
live.</p>
<p>We here obviously place before us, as a subject of research, the
Creation of Living Things;&#8212;a subject shrouded in mystery, and
not to be approached without reverence. But though we may conceive,
that, on this subject, we are not to seek our belief from science
alone, we shall find, it is asserted, within the limits of allowable
and unavoidable speculation, many curious and important problems which
may well employ our physiological skill. For example, we may
ask:&#8212;how we are to recognize the species which were originally
created distinct?&#8212;whether the population of the earth at one
geological epoch could pass to the form which it has at a succeeding
period, by the agency of natural causes alone?&#8212;and if not, what
other account we can give of the succession which we find to have
taken place?</p>
<p>The most remarkable point in the attempts to answer these and the
like questions, is the controversy between the advocates and the
opponents of the doctrine of the <i>transmutation of species</i>. This
question is, even from its mere physiological import, one of great
interest; and the interest is much enhanced by our geological
researches, which again bring the question before us in a striking
form, and on a gigantic scale. We shall, therefore, briefly state the
point at issue.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Question of the Transmutation of
Species.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">We</span> see that animals and
plants may, by the influence of breeding, and of external agents
operating upon their constitution, be greatly <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page564">564</a></span> modified, so as to give rise to
varieties and races different from what before existed. How different,
for instance, is one kind and breed of dog from another! The question,
then, is, whether organized beings can, by the mere working of natural
causes, pass from the type of one species to that of another? whether
the wolf may, by domestication, become the dog? whether the
ourang-outang may, by the power of external circumstances, be brought
within the circle of the human species? And the dilemma in which we
are placed is this;&#8212;that if species are not thus
interchangeable, we must suppose the fluctuations of which each
species is capable, and which are apparently indefinite, to be bounded
by rigorous limits; whereas, if we allow such a <i>transmutation of
species</i>, we abandon that belief in the adaptation of the structure
of every creature to its destined mode of being, which not only most
persons would give up with repugnance, but which, as we have seen, has
constantly and irresistibly impressed itself on the minds of the best
naturalists, as the true view of the order of the world.</p>
<p>But the study of Geology opens to us the spectacle of many groups
of species which have, in the course of the earth’s history, succeeded
each other at vast intervals of time; one set of animals and plants
disappearing, as it would seem, from the face of our planet, and
others, which did not before exist, becoming the only occupants of the
globe. And the dilemma then presents itself to us anew:&#8212;either
we must accept the doctrine of the transmutation of species, and must
suppose that the organized species of one geological epoch were
transmuted into those of another by some long-continued agency of
natural causes; or else, we must believe in many successive acts of
creation and extinction of species, out of the common course of
nature; acts which, therefore, we may properly call miraculous.</p>
<p>This latter dilemma, however, is a question concerning the facts
which have happened in the history of the world; the deliberation
respecting it belongs to physical geology itself, and not to that
subsidiary science which we are now describing, and which is concerned
only with such causes as we know to be in constant and orderly
action.</p>
<p>The former question, of the limited or unlimited extent of the
modifications of animals and plants, has received full and careful
consideration from eminent physiologists; and in their opinions we
find, I think, an indisputable preponderance to that decision which
rejects the transmutation of species, and which accepts the former
side of the dilemma; namely, that the changes of which each species is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page565">565</a></span> susceptible,
though difficult to define in words, are limited in fact. It is
extremely interesting and satisfactory thus to receive an answer in
which we can confide, to inquiries seemingly so wide and bold as those
which this subject involves. I refer to Mr. Lyell, Dr. Prichard, Mr.
Lawrence, and others, for the history of the discussion, and for the
grounds of the decision; and I shall quote very briefly the main
points and conclusions to which the inquiry has led.<a
id="fnanchor82-18" href="#note82-18"><span
class="fnanchor">82</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note82-18"
href="#fnanchor82-18">82</a></span> Lyell, B. iii. c. iv.</div>
<p>It may be considered, then, as determined by the over-balance of
physiological authority, that there is a capacity in all species to
accommodate themselves, to a certain extent, to a change of external
circumstances; this extent varying greatly according to the species.
There may thus arise changes of appearance or structure, and some of
these changes are transmissible to the offspring: but the mutations
thus superinduced are governed by constant laws, and confined within
certain limits. Indefinite divergence from the original type is not
possible; and the extreme limit of possible variation may usually be
reached in a brief period of time: in short, <em>species have a real
existence in nature</em>, and a transmutation from one to another does
not exist.</p>
<p>Thus, for example, Cuvier remarks, that notwithstanding all the
differences of size, appearance, and habits, which we find in the dogs
of various races and countries, and though we have (in the Egyptian
mummies) skeletons of this animal as it existed three thousand years
ago, the relation of the bones to each other remains essentially the
same; and, with all the varieties of their shape<a id="fnanchor83-18"
href="#note83-18"><span class="fnanchor">83</span></a> and size, there
are characters which resist all the influences both of external
nature, of human intercourse, and of time.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 4.&#8212;<i>Hypothesis of Progressive
Tendencies.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Within</span> certain limits,
however, as we have said, external circumstances produce changes in
the forms of organized beings. The causes of change, and the laws and
limits of their effects, as they obtain in the existing state of the
organic creation, are in the highest degree interesting. And, as has
been already intimated, the knowledge thus obtained, has been applied
with a view to explain the origin of the existing population of the
world, and the succession of its past conditions. But those who have
attempted such an explanation, have found it necessary to assume
certain additional laws, in order to enable themselves to <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page566">566</a></span> deduce, from the
tenet of the transmutability of the species of organized beings, such
a state of things as we see about us, and such a succession of states
as is evidenced by geological researches. And here, again, we are
brought to questions of which we must seek the answers from the most
profound physiologists. Now referring, as before, to those which
appear to be the best authorities, it is found that these additional
positive laws are still more inadmissible than the primary assumption
of indefinite capacity of change. For example, in order to account, on
this hypothesis, for the seeming adaptation of the endowments of
animals to their wants, it is held that the endowments are the result
of the wants; that the swiftness of the antelope, the claws and teeth
of the lion, the trunk of the elephant, the long neck of the giraffe
have been produced by a certain plastic character in the constitution
of animals, operated upon, for a long course of ages, by the attempts
which these animals made to attain objects which their previous
organization did not place within their reach. In this way, it is
maintained that the most striking attributes of animals, those which
apparently imply most clearly the providing skill of their Creator,
have been brought forth by the long-repeated efforts of the creatures
to attain the object of their desire; thus animals with the highest
endowments have been gradually developed from ancestral forms of the
most limited organization; thus fish, bird, and beast, have grown from
<em>small gelatinous bodies</em>, “petits corps gelatineux,”
possessing some obscure principle of life, and the capacity of
development; and thus man himself with all his intellectual and moral,
as well as physical privileges, has been derived from some creature of
the ape or baboon tribe, urged by a constant tendency to improve, or
at least to alter his condition.</p>
<p>As we have said, in order to arrive even hypothetically at this
result, it is necessary to assume besides a mere capacity for change,
other positive and active principles, some of which we may notice.
Thus, we must have as the direct productions of nature on this
hypothesis, certain monads or rough draughts, the primary
<i>rudiments</i> of plants and animals. We must have, in these, a
constant <i>tendency to progressive improvement</i>, to the attainment
of higher powers and faculties than they possess; which tendency is
again perpetually modified and controlled by the <i>force of external
circumstances</i>. And in order to account for the simultaneous
existence of animals in every stage of this imaginary progress, we
must suppose that nature is compelled to be <em>constantly</em>
producing those elementary beings, from which all animals are
successively developed. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page567">567</a></span></p>
<p>I need not stay to point out how extremely arbitrary every part of
this scheme is; and how complex its machinery would be, even if it did
account for the facts. It may be sufficient to observe, as others have
done,<a id="fnanchor84-18" href="#note84-18"><span
class="fnanchor">84</span></a> that the capacity of change, and of
being influenced by external circumstances, such as we really find it
in nature, and therefore such as in science we must represent it, is a
tendency, not to improve, but to deteriorate. When species are
modified by external causes, they usually degenerate, and do not
advance. And there is no instance of a species acquiring an entirely
new sense, faculty, or organ, in addition to, or in the place of, what
it had before.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note84-18"
href="#fnanchor84-18">84</a></span> Lyell, B. <span
class="sc">iii</span>. c. iv.</div>
<p>Not only, then, is the doctrine of the transmutation of species in
itself disproved by the best physiological reasonings, but the
additional assumptions which are requisite, to enable its advocates to
apply it to the explanation of the geological and other phenomena of
the earth, are altogether gratuitous and fantastical.</p>
<p>Such is the judgment to which we are led by the examination of the
discussions which have taken place on this subject. Yet in certain
speculations, occasioned by the discovery of the <i>Sivatherium</i>, a
new fossil animal from the Sub-Himalaya mountains of India, M.
Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire speaks of the belief in the immutability of
species as a conviction which is fading away from men’s minds. He
speaks too of the termination of the age of Cuvier, “la clôture du
siècle de Cuvier,” and of the commencement of a better zoological
philosophy.<a id="fnanchor85-18" href="#note85-18"><span
class="fnanchor">85</span></a> But though he expresses himself with
great animation, I do not perceive that he adduces, in support of his
peculiar opinions, any arguments in addition to those which he urged
during the lifetime of Cuvier. And the reader<a id="fnanchor86-18"
href="#note86-18"><span class="fnanchor">86</span></a> may recollect
that the consideration of that controversy led us to very different
anticipations from his, respecting the probable future progress of
physiology. The discovery of the Sivatherium supplies no particle of
proof to the hypothesis, that the existing species of animals are
descended from extinct creatures which are specifically distinct: and
we cannot act more wisely than in listening to the advice of that
eminent naturalist, M. de Blainville.<a id="fnanchor87-18"
href="#note87-18"><span class="fnanchor">87</span></a> “Against this
hypothesis, which, up to the present time, I regard as purely
gratuitous, and likely to turn geologists out of the sound and
excellent road in which they now are, I willingly raise my voice, with
the most absolute conviction of being in the right.”</p>

[The hypothesis of the progressive developement of species has been
urged recently, in connexion with the physiological tenet of Tiedemann
and De Serres, noticed in B. <span class="sc">xvii</span>. c. vii. <a
href="#b17-7-3">sect. 3</a>;&#8212;namely, that the embryo of the
higher forms of animals passes by gradations through those forms which
are permanent in inferior animals. Assuming this tenet as exact, it
has been maintained that the higher animals which are found in the
more recent strata may have been produced by an ulterior development
of the lower forms in the embryo state; the circumstances being such
as to favor such a developement. But all the best physiologists agree
in declaring that such an extraordinary developement of the embryo is
inconsistent with physiological possibility. Even if the progression
of the embryo in time have a general correspondence with the order of
animal forms as more or less perfectly organized (which is true in an
extremely incomplete and inexact degree), this correspondence must be
considered, not as any indication of causality, but as one of those
marks of universal analogy and symmetry which are stamped upon every
part of the creation.</p>
<p>Mr. Lyell<a id="fnanchor88-18" href="#note88-18"><span
class="fnanchor">88</span></a> notices this doctrine of Tiedemann and
De Serres; and observes, that though nature presents us with cases of
animal forms degraded by incomplete developement, she offers none of
forms exalted by extraordinary developement. Mr. Lyell’s own
hypothesis of the introduction of new species upon the earth, not
having any physiological basis, hardly belongs to this chapter.]</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 5.&#8212;<i>Question of Creation as related to
Science.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">But</span> since we reject the
production of new species by means of external influence, do we then,
it may be asked, accept the other side of the dilemma which we have
stated; and admit a series of creations of species, by some power
beyond that which we trace in the ordinary course of nature?</p>
<p>To this question, the history and analogy of science, I conceive,
teach us to reply as follows:&#8212;All palætiological sciences, all
speculations which attempt to ascend from the present to the remote
past, by the chain of causation, do also, by an inevitable
consequence, urge us to look for the beginning of the state of things
which we thus contemplate; but in none of these cases have men been
able, by the aid of science, to arrive at a beginning which is
homogeneous with the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page569">569</a></span> known course of events. The first origin
of language, of civilization, of law and government, cannot be clearly
made out by reasoning and research; just as little, we may expect,
will a knowledge of the origin of the existing and extinct species of
plants and animals, be the result of physiological and geological
investigation.</p>
<p>But, though philosophers have never yet demonstrated, and perhaps
never will be able to demonstrate, what was that primitive state of
things in the social and material worlds, from which the progressive
state took its first departure; they can still, in all the lines of
research to which we have referred, go very far back;&#8212;determine
many of the remote circumstances of the past sequence of
events;&#8212;ascend to a point which, from our position at least,
seems to be near the origin;&#8212;and exclude many suppositions
respecting the origin itself. Whether, by the light of reason alone,
men will ever be able to do more than this, it is difficult to say. It
is, I think, no irrational opinion, even on grounds of philosophical
analogy alone, that in all those sciences which look back and seek a
beginning of things, we may be unable to arrive at a consistent and
definite belief, without having recourse to other grounds of truth, as
well as to historical research and scientific reasoning. When our
thoughts would apprehend steadily the creation of things, we find that
we are obliged to summon up other ideas than those which regulate the
pursuit of scientific truths;&#8212;to call in other powers than those
to which we refer natural events: it cannot, then, be considered as
very surprizing, if, in this part of our inquiry, we are compelled to
look for other than the ordinary evidence of science.</p>
<p>Geology, forming one of the palætiological class of sciences, which
trace back the history of the earth and its inhabitants on
philosophical grounds, is thus associated with a number of other kinds
of research, which are concerned about language, law, art, and
consequently about the internal faculties of man, his thoughts, his
social habits, his conception of right, his love of beauty. Geology
being thus brought into the atmosphere of moral and mental
speculations, it may be expected that her investigations of the
probable past will share an influence common to them; and that she
will not be allowed to point to an origin of her own, a merely
physical beginning of things; but that, as she approaches towards such
a goal, she will be led to see that it is the origin of many trains of
events, the point of convergence of many lines. It may be, that
instead of being allowed to travel up to this focus of being, we are
only able to estimate its place and nature, and <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page570">570</a></span> to form of it such a
judgment as this;&#8212;that it is not only the source of mere
vegetable and animal life, but also of rational and social life,
language and arts, law and order; in short, of all the progressive
tendencies by which the highest principles of the intellectual and
moral world have been and are developed, as well as of the succession
of organic forms, which we find scattered, dead or living, over the
earth.</p>
<p>This reflection concerning the natural scientific view of creation,
it will be observed, has not been sought for, from a wish to arrive at
such conclusions; but it has flowed spontaneously from the manner in
which we have had to introduce geology into our classification of the
sciences; and this classification was framed from an unbiassed
consideration of the general analogies and guiding ideas of the
various portions of our knowledge. Such remarks as we have made may on
this account be considered more worthy of attention.</p>
<p>But such a train of thought must be pursued with caution. Although
it may not be possible to arrive at a right conviction respecting the
origin of the world, without having recourse to other than physical
considerations, and to other than geological evidence: yet extraneous
considerations, and extraneous evidence, respecting the nature of the
beginning of things, must never be allowed to influence our physics or
our geology. Our geological dynamics, like our astronomical dynamics,
may be inadequate to carry us back to an origin of that state of
things, of which it explains the progress: but this deficiency must be
supplied, not by adding supernatural to natural geological dynamics,
but by accepting, in their proper place, the views supplied by a
portion of knowledge of a different character and order. If we include
in our Theology the speculations to which we have recourse for this
purpose, we must exclude from them our Geology. The two sciences may
conspire, not by having any part in common: but because, though widely
diverse in their lines, both point to a mysterious and invisible
origin of the world.</p>
<p>All that which claims our assent on those higher grounds of which
theology takes cognizance, must claim such assent as is consistent
with those grounds; that is, it must require belief in respect of all
that bears upon the highest relations of our being, those on which
depend our duties and our hopes. Doctrines of this kind may and must
be conveyed and maintained, by means of information concerning the
past history of man, and his social and material, as well as moral and
spiritual fortunes. He who believes that a Providence has <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page571">571</a></span> ruled the affairs of
mankind, will also believe that a Providence has governed the material
world. But any language in which the narrative of this government of
the material world can be conveyed, must necessarily be very imperfect
and inappropriate; being expressed in terms of those ideas which have
been selected by men, in order to describe appearances and relations
of created things as they affect one another. In all cases, therefore,
where we have to attempt to interpret such a narrative, we must feel
that we are extremely liable to err; and most of all, when our
interpretation refers to those material objects and operations which
are most foreign to the main purpose of a history of providence. If we
have to consider a communication containing a view of such a
government of the world, imparted to us, as we may suppose, in order
to point out the right direction for our feelings of trust, and
reverence, and hope, towards the Governor of the world, we may expect
that we shall be in no danger of collecting from our authority
erroneous notions with regard to the power, and wisdom, and goodness
of His government; or with respect to our own place, duties, and
prospects, and the history of our race so far as our duties and
prospects are concerned. But that we shall rightly understand the
detail of all events in the history of man, or of the skies, or of the
earth, which are narrated for the purpose of thus giving a right
direction to our minds, is by no means equally certain; and I do not
think it would be too much to say, that an immunity from perplexity
and error, in such matters, is, on general grounds, very improbable.
It cannot then surprise us to find, that parts of such narrations
which seem to refer to occurrences like those of which astronomers and
geologists have attempted to determine the laws, have given rise to
many interpretations, all inconsistent with one another, and most of
them at variance with the best established principles of astronomy and
geology.</p>
<p>It may be urged, that all truths must be consistent with all other
truths, and that therefore the results of true geology or astronomy
cannot be irreconcileable with the statements of true theology. And
this universal consistency of truth with itself must be assented to;
but it by no means follows that we must be able to obtain a full
insight into the nature and manner of such a consistency. Such an
insight would only be possible if we could obtain a clear view of that
central body of truth, the source of the principles which appear in
the separate lines of speculation. To expect that we should see
clearly how the providential government of the world is consistent
with the unvarying laws <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page572">572</a></span> by which its motions and developements
are regulated, is to expect to understand thoroughly the laws of
motion, of developement, and of providence; it is to expect that we
may ascend from geology and astronomy to the creative and legislative
centre, from which proceeded earth and stars; and then descend again
into the moral and spiritual world, because its source and centre are
the same as those of the material creation. It is to say that reason,
whether finite or infinite, must be consistent with itself; and that,
therefore, the finite must be able to comprehend the infinite, to
travel from any one province of the moral and material universe to any
other, to trace their bearing, and to connect their boundaries.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of the study of the history and nature of
science in which we are now engaged is, that it warns us of the
hopeless and presumptuous character of such attempts to understand the
government of the world by the aid of science, without throwing any
discredit upon the reality of our knowledge;&#8212;that while it shows
how solid and certain each science is, so long as it refers its own
facts to its own ideas, it confines each science within its own
limits, and condemns it as empty and helpless, when it pronounces upon
those subjects which are extraneous to it. The error of persons who
should seek a geological narrative in theological records, would be
rather in the search itself than in their interpretation of what they
might find; and in like manner the error of those who would conclude
against a supernatural beginning, or a providential direction of the
world, upon geological or physiological reasonings, would be, that
they had expected those sciences alone to place the origin or the
government of the world in its proper light.</p>
<p>Though these observations apply generally to all the palætiological
sciences, they may be permitted here, because they have an especial
bearing upon some of the difficulties which have embarrassed the
progress of geological speculation; and though such difficulties are,
I trust, nearly gone by, it is important for us to see them in their
true bearing.</p>
<p>From what has been said, it follows that geology and astronomy are,
of themselves, incapable of giving us any distinct and satisfactory
account of the origin of the universe, or of its parts. We need not
wonder, then, at any particular instance of this incapacity; as, for
example, that of which we have been speaking, the impossibility of
accounting by any natural means for the production of all the
successive tribes of plants and animals which have peopled the world
in the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page573">573</a></span> various
stages of its progress, as geology teaches us. That they were, like
our own animal and vegetable contemporaries, profoundly adapted to the
condition in which they were placed, we have ample reason to believe;
but when we inquire whence they came into this our world, geology is
silent. The mystery of creation is not within the range of her
legitimate territory; she says nothing, but she points upwards.</p>

<p>1. <i>Creation of Species.</i>&#8212;We have already seen, how
untenable, as a physiological doctrine, is the principle of the
transmutability and progressive tendency of species; and therefore,
when we come to apply to theoretical geology the principles of the
present chapter, this portion of the subject will easily be disposed
of. I hardly know whether I can state that there is any other
principle which has been applied to the solution of the geological
problem, and which, therefore, as a general truth, ought to be
considered here. Mr. Lyell, indeed, has spoken<a id="fnanchor89-18"
href="#note89-18"><span class="fnanchor">89</span></a> of an
hypothesis that “the successive creation of species may constitute a
regular part of the economy of nature:” but he has nowhere, I think,
so described this process as to make it appear in what department of
science we are to place the hypothesis. Are these new species created
by the production, at long intervals, of an offspring different in
species from the parents? Or are the species so created produced
without parents? Are they gradually evolved from some embryo
substance? or do they suddenly start from the ground, as in the
creation of the poet?</p>

Physical Philosophy.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [Mr. Lyell has explained his theory<a id="fnanchor90-18"

man to people a great desert, introducing into it living plants and
animals: and he has traced, in a very interesting manner, the results
of such a hypothesis on the distribution of vegetable and animal
species. But he supposes the agents who do this, before they import
species into particular localities, to study attentively the climate
and other physical conditions of each spot, and to use various
precautions. It is on account of the notion of design thus introduced
that I have, above, described this opinion as rather a tenet of
Natural Theology than of Physical Philosophy.</p>

<p>Mr. Edward Forbes has published some highly interesting
speculations on the distribution of existing species of animals and
plants. It appears that the manner in which animal and vegetable forms
are now diffused requires us to assume centres from which the
diffusion took place by no means limited by the present divisions of
continents and islands. The changes of land and water which have thus
occurred since the existing species were placed on the earth must have
been very extensive, and perhaps reach into the glacial period of
which I have spoken above.<a id="fnanchor91-18"
href="#note91-18"><span class="fnanchor">91</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note91-18"
href="#fnanchor91-18">91</a></span> See, in <i>Memoirs of the
Geological Survey of Great Britain</i>, vol. i. p. 336, Professor
Forbes’s Memoir “On the Connection between the Distribution of the
existing Fauna and Flora of the British Isles, and the Geological
Changes which have affected their area, especially during the epoch of
the Northern Drift.”</div>
<p>According to Mr. Forbes’s views, for which he has offered a great
body of very striking and converging reasons, the present vegetable
and animal population of the British Isles is to be accounted for by
the following series of events. The marine deposits of the
<i>meiocine</i> formation were elevated into a great Atlantic
continent, yet separate from what is now America, and having its
western shore where now the great semi-circular belt of gulf-weed
ranges from the 15th to the 45th parallel of latitude. This continent
then became stocked with life, and of its vegetable population, the
flora of the west of Ireland, which has many points in common with the
flora of Spain and the <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page575">575</a></span> Atlantic islands (the <i>Asturian</i>
flora), is the record. The region between Spain and Ireland, and the
rest of this meiocene continent, was destroyed by some geological
movement, but there were left traces of the connexion which still
remain. Eastwards of the flora just mentioned, there is a flora common
to Devon and Cornwall, to the south-east part of Ireland, the Channel
Isles, and the adjacent provinces of France;&#8212;a flora passing to
a southern character; and having its course marked by the remains of a
great rocky barrier, the destruction of which probably took place
anterior to the formation of the narrower part of the channel.
Eastward from this <i>Devon</i> or <i>Norman</i> flora, again, we have
the <i>Kentish</i> flora, which is an extension of the flora of
North-western France, insulated by the breach which formed the straits
of Dover. Then came the <i>Glacial period</i>, when the east of
England and the north of Europe were submerged, the northern drift was
distributed, and England was reduced to a chain of islands or ridges,
formed by the mountains of Wales, Cumberland, and Scotland, which were
connected with the land of Scandinavia. This was the period of
glaciers, of the dispersion of boulders, of the grooving and
scratching of rocks as they are now found. The climate being then much
colder than it now is, the flora, even down to the water’s edge,
consisted of what are now Alpine plants; and this <i>Alpine</i> flora
is common to Scandinavia and to our mountain-summits. And these plants
kept their places, when, by the elevation of the land, the whole of
the present German Ocean became a continent connecting Britain with
central Europe. For the increased elevation of their stations
counterbalanced the diminished cold of the succeeding period. Along
the dry bed of the German Sea, thus elevated, the principal part of
the existing flora of England, the <i>Germanic</i> flora, migrated. A
large portion of our existing animal population also came over through
the same region; and along with those, came hyenas, tigers,
rhinoceros, aurochs, elk, wolves, beavers, which are extinct in
Britain, and other animals which are extinct altogether, as the
primigenian elephant or mammoth. But then, again, the German Ocean and
the Irish Channel were scooped out; and the climate again changed. In
our islands, so detached, many of the larger beasts perished, and
their bones were covered up in peat-mosses and caves, where we find
them. This distinguished naturalist has further shown that the
population of the sea lends itself to the same view. Mr. Forbes says
that the writings of Mr. Smith, of Jordan-hill, “On the last Changes
in the relative Levels of the Land and Sea in the British Islands,”
published in the <i>Memoirs of the</i> <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page576">576</a></span> <i>Wernerian Society for</i>
1837&#8211;8, must be esteemed the foundation of a critical
investigation of this subject in Britain.]</p>
<p>2. <i>Extinction of Species.</i>&#8212;With regard to the
extinction of species Mr. Lyell has propounded a doctrine which is
deserving of great attention here. Brocchi, when he had satisfied
himself, by examination of the Sub-Apennines, that about half the
species which had lived at the period of their deposition, had since
become extinct, suggested as a possible cause for this occurrence,
that the vital energies of a species, like that of an individual,
might gradually decay in the progress of time and of generations, till
at last the prolific power might fail, and the species wither away.
Such a property would be conceivable as a physiological fact; for we
see something of the kind in fruit-trees propagated by cuttings: after
some time, the stock appears to wear out, and loses its peculiar
qualities. But we have no sufficient evidence that this is the case in
generations of creatures continued by the reproductive powers. Mr.
Lyell conceives, that, without admitting any inherent constitutional
tendency to deteriorate, the misfortunes to which plants and animals
are exposed by the change of the physical circumstances of the earth,
by the alteration of land and water, and by the changes of climate,
must very frequently occasion the loss of several species. We have
historical evidence of the extinction of one conspicuous species, the
Dodo, a bird of large size and singular form, which inhabited the Isle
of France when that island was first discovered, and which now no
longer exists. Several other species of animals and plants seem to be
in the course of vanishing from the face of the earth, even under our
own observation. And taking into account the greater changes of the
surface of the globe which geology compels us to assume, we may
imagine many or all the existing species of living things to be
extirpated. If, for instance, that reduction of the climate of the
earth which appears, from geological evidence, to have taken place
already, be supposed to go on much further, the advancing snow and
cold of the polar regions may destroy the greater part of our plants
and animals, and drive the remainder, or those of them which possess
the requisite faculties of migration and accommodation, to seek an
asylum near the equator. And if we suppose the temperature of the
earth to be still further reduced, this zone of now-existing life,
having no further place of refuge, will perish, and the whole earth
will be tenanted, if at all, by a new creation. Other causes might
produce the same effect as a change of climate; and, without supposing
such causes to affect the whole globe, it is easy to <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page577">577</a></span> imagine circumstances
such as might entirely disturb the equilibrium which the powers of
diffusion of different species have produced;&#8212;might give to some
the opportunity of invading and conquering the domain of others; and
in the end, the means of entirely suppressing them, and establishing
themselves in their place.</p>
<p>That this extirpation of certain species, which, as we have seen,
happens in a few cases under common circumstances, might happen upon a
greater scale, if the range of external changes were to be much
enlarged, cannot be doubted. The extent, therefore, to which natural
causes may account for the extinction of species, will depend upon the
amount of change which we suppose in the physical conditions of the
earth. It must be a task of extreme difficulty to estimate the effect
upon the organic world, even if the physical circumstances were given.
To determine the physical condition to which a given state of the
earth would give rise, I have already noted as another very difficult
problem. Yet these two problems must be solved, in order to enable us
to judge of the sufficiency of any hypothesis of the extinction of
species; and in the mean time, for the mode in which new species come
into the places of those which are extinguished, we have (as we have
seen) no hypothesis which physiology can, for a moment, sanction.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 7.&#8212;<i>The Imbedding of Organic
Remains.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">There</span> is still one portion of
the Dynamics of Geology, a branch of great and manifest importance,
which I have to notice, but upon which I need only speak very briefly.
The mode in which the spoils of existing plants and animals are
imbedded in the deposits now forming, is a subject which has naturally
attracted the attention of geologists. During the controversy which
took place in Italy respecting the fossils of the Sub-Apennine hills,
Vitaliano Donati,<a id="fnanchor92-18" href="#note92-18"><span
class="fnanchor">92</span></a> in 1750, undertook an examination of
the Adriatic, and found that deposits containing shells and corals,
extremely resembling the strata of the hills, were there in the act of
formation. But without dwelling on other observations of like kind, I
may state that Mr. Lyell has treated this subject, and all the topics
connected with it, in a very full and satisfactory manner. He has
explained,<a id="fnanchor93-18" href="#note93-18"><span
class="fnanchor">93</span></a> by an excellent collection of
illustrative facts, how deposits of various substance and contents are
formed; how plants and animals become fossil in peat, in blown sand,
in volcanic matter, in <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page578">578</a></span> alluvial soil, in caves, and in the beds
of lakes and seas. This exposition is of the most instructive
character, as a means of obtaining right conclusions concerning the
causes of geological phenomena. Indeed, in many cases, the similarity
of past effects with operations now going on, is so complete, that
they may be considered as identical; and the discussion of such cases
belongs, at the same time, to Geological Dynamics and to Physical
Geology; just as the problem of the fall of meteorolites may be
considered as belonging alike to mechanics and to physical astronomy.
The growth of modern peat-mosses, for example, fully explains the
formation of the most ancient: objects are buried in the same manner
in the ejections of active and of extinct volcanoes; within the limits
of history, many estuaries have been filled up; and in the deposits
which have occupied these places, are strata containing shells,<a
id="fnanchor94-18" href="#note94-18"><span
class="fnanchor">94</span></a> as in the older formations.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">Progress of Physical Geology.</span></h3>
<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Object and Distinctions of
Physical Geology.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">BEING</span>, in consequence of the
steps which we have attempted to describe, in possession of two
sciences, one of which traces the laws of action of known causes, and
the other describes the phenomena which the earth’s surface presents,
we are now prepared to examine how far the attempts to refer the facts
to their causes have been successful: we are ready to enter upon the
consideration of Theoretical or <i>Physical</i> Geology, as, by
analogy with Physical Astronomy, we may term this branch of
speculation.</p>
<p>The distinction of this from other portions of our knowledge is
sufficiently evident. In former times, Geology was always associated
with Mineralogy, and sometimes confounded with it; but the mistake of
such an arrangement must be clear, from what has been said. Geology is
connected with Mineralogy, only so far as the latter science
classifies a large portion of the objects which Geology employs as
evidence of its statements. To confound the two is the same error as
it would be to treat philosophical history as identical with the
knowledge of medals. Geology procures evidence of her conclusions
wherever she can; from minerals or from seas; from inorganic or from
organic bodies; from the ground or from the skies. The geologist’s
business is to learn the past history of the earth; and he is no more
limited to one or a few kinds of documents, as his sources of
information, than is the historian of man, in the execution of a
similar task.</p>
<p>Physical Geology, of which I now speak, may not be always easily
separable from Descriptive Geology: in fact, they have generally been
combined, for few have been content to describe, without attempting in
some measure to explain. Indeed, if they had done so, it is <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page580">580</a></span> probable that their
labors would have been far less zealous, and their expositions far
less impressive. We by no means regret, therefore, the mixture of
these two kinds of knowledge, which has so often occurred; but still,
it is our business to separate them. The works of astronomers before
the rise of sound physical astronomy, were full of theories, but these
were advantageous, not prejudicial, to the progress of the
science.</p>
<p>Geological theories have been abundant and various; but yet our
history of them must be brief. For our object is, as must be borne in
mind, to exhibit these, only so far as they are steps discoverably
tending to the <em>true</em> theory of the earth: and in most of them
we do not trace this character. Or rather, the portions of the labors
of geologists which do merit this praise, belong to the two preceding
divisions of the subject, and have been treated of there.</p>
<p>The history of Physical Geology, considered as the advance towards
a science as real and stable as those which we have already treated of
(and this is the form in which we ought to trace it), hitherto
consists of few steps. We hardly know whether the progress is begun.
The history of Physical Astronomy almost commences with Newton, and
few persons will venture to assert that the Newton of Geology has yet
appeared.</p>
<p>Still, some examination of the attempts which have been made is
requisite, in order to explain and justify the view which the analogy
of scientific history leads us to take, of the state of the subject.
Though far from intending to give even a sketch of all past geological
speculations, I must notice some of the forms such speculations have
at different times assumed.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Of Fanciful Geological Opinions.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Real</span> and permanent geological
knowledge, like all other physical knowledge, can be obtained only by
inductions of classification and law from many clearly seen phenomena.
The labor of the most active, the talent of the most intelligent, are
requisite for such a purpose. But far less than this is sufficient to
put in busy operation the inventive and capricious fancy. A few
appearances hastily seen, and arbitrarily interpreted, are enough to
give rise to a wondrous tale of the past, full of strange events and
supernatural agencies. The mythology and early poetry of nations
afford sufficient evidence of man’s love of the wonderful, and of his
inventive powers, in early stages of intellectual development. The
scientific faculty, on the other hand, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page581">581</a></span> and especially that part of it which is
requisite for the induction of laws from facts, emerges slowly and
with difficulty from the crowd of adverse influences, even under the
most favorable circumstances. We have seen that in the ancient world,
the Greeks alone showed themselves to possess this talent; and what
they thus attained to, amounted only to a few sound doctrines in
astronomy, and one or two extremely imperfect truths in mechanics,
optics, and music, which their successors were unable to retain. No
other nation, till we come to the dawn of a better day in modern
Europe, made any positive step at all in sound physical speculation.
Empty dreams or useless exhibitions of ingenuity, formed the whole of
their essays at such knowledge.</p>
<p>It must, therefore, independently of positive evidence, be
considered as extremely improbable, that any of these nations should,
at an early period, have arrived, by observation and induction, at
wide general truths, such as the philosophers of modern times have
only satisfied themselves of by long and patient labor and thought. If
resemblances should be discovered between the assertions of ancient
writers and the discoveries of modern science, the probability in all
cases, the certainty in most, is that these are accidental
coincidences;&#8212;that the ancient opinion is no anticipation of the
modern discovery, but is one guess among many, not a whit the more
valuable because its expression agrees with a truth. The author of the
guess could not intend the truth, because his mind was not prepared to
comprehend it. Those of the ancients who spoke of the <em>harmony</em>
which binds all things together, could not mean the Newtonian
gravitation, because they had never been led to conceive an attractive
force, governed by definite mathematical laws in its quantity and
operation.</p>
<p>In agreement with these views, we must, I conceive, estimate the
opinions which we find among the ancients, respecting the changes
which the earth’s surface has undergone. These opinions, when they are
at all of a general kind, are arbitrary fictions of the fancy, showing
man’s love of generality indeed, but indulging it without that expense
of labor and thought which alone can render it legitimate.</p>
<p>We might, therefore, pass by all the traditions and speculations of
Oriental, Egyptian, and Greek cosmogony, as extraneous to our subject.
But since these have recently been spoken of, as conclusions
collected, however vaguely, from observed facts,<a id="fnanchor95-18"
href="#note95-18"><span class="fnanchor">95</span></a> we may make a
remark or two upon them.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note95-18"
href="#fnanchor95-18">95</a></span> Lyell, B. i. c. ii. p. 8. (4th
ed.)</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page582">582</a></span> The notion
of a series of creations and destructions of worlds, which appears in
the sacred volume of the Hindoos, which formed part of the
traditionary lore of Egypt, and which was afterwards adopted into the
poetry and philosophy of Greece, must be considered as a mythological,
not a physical, doctrine. When this doctrine was dwelt upon, men’s
thoughts were directed, not to the terrestrial facts which it seemed
to explain, but to the attributes of the deities which it illustrated.
The conception of a Supreme power, impelling and guiding the progress
of events, which is permanent among all perpetual change, and regular
among all seeming chance, was readily entertained by contemplative and
enthusiastic minds; and when natural phenomena were referred to this
doctrine, it was rather for the purpose of fastening its
impressiveness upon the senses, than in the way of giving to it
authority and support. Hence we perceive that in the exposition of
this doctrine, an attempt was always made to fill and elevate the mind
with the notions of marvellous events, and of infinite times, in which
vast cycles of order recurred. The “great year,” in which all
celestial phenomena come round, offered itself as capable of being
calculated; and a similar great year was readily assumed for
terrestrial and human events. Hence there were to be brought round by
great cycles, not only deluges and conflagrations which were to
destroy and renovate the earth, but also the series of historical
occurrences. Not only the sea and land were to recommence their
alternations, but there was to be another Argo, which should carry
warriors on the first sea-foray,<a id="fnanchor96-18"
href="#note96-18"><span class="fnanchor">96</span></a> and another
succession of heroic wars. Looking at the passages of ancient authors
which refer to terrestrial changes in this view, we shall see that
they are addressed almost entirely to the love of the marvellous and
the infinite, and cannot with propriety be taken as indications of a
spirit of physical philosophy. For example, if we turn to the
celebrated passage in Ovid,<a id="fnanchor97-18"
href="#note97-18"><span class="fnanchor">97</span></a> where
Pythagoras is represented as asserting that land becomes sea, and sea
land, and many other changes which geologists have verified, we find
that these observations are associated with many fables, as being
matter of exactly the same kind;&#8212;the fountain of Ammon which was
cold by day and warm by night;<a id="fnanchor98-18"
href="#note98-18"><span class="fnanchor">98</span></a>&#8212;the
waters of Salmacis which effeminate men;&#8212;the Clitorian spring
which makes them loathe wine;&#8212;the Simplegades islands which were
once moveable;&#8212;the Tritonian lake which covered men’s bodies
with feathers;&#8212;and many similar marvels. And the general purport
of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page583">583</a></span> the whole
is, to countenance the doctrine of the metempsychosis, and the
Pythagorean injunction of not eating animal food. It is clear, I
think, that facts so introduced must be considered as having been
contemplated rather in the spirit of poetry than of science.</p>

href="#fnanchor98-18">98</a></span> V. 309, &amp;c.</div>
<p>We must estimate in the same manner, the very remarkable passage
brought to light by M. Elie de Beaumont,<a id="fnanchor99-18"
href="#note99-18"><span class="fnanchor">99</span></a> from the
Arabian writer, Kazwiri; in which we have a representation of the same
spot of ground, as being, at successive intervals of five hundred
years, a city, a sea, a desert, and again a city. This invention is
adduced, I conceive, rather to feed the appetite of wonder, than to
fix it upon any reality: as the title of his book, <i>The Marvels of
Nature</i> obviously intimates.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note99-18"
href="#fnanchor99-18">99</a></span> <i>Ann. des Sc. Nat.</i> xxv.

<p>The speculations of Aristotle, concerning the exchanges of land and
sea which take place in long periods, are not formed in exactly the
same spirit, but they are hardly more substantial; and seem to be
quite as arbitrary, since they are not confirmed by any examples and
proofs. After stating,<a id="fnanchor100-18" href="#note100-18"><span
class="fnanchor">100</span></a> that the same spots of the earth are
not always land and always water, he gives the reason. “The principle
and cause of this is,” he says, “that the inner parts of the earth,
like the bodies of plants and animals, have their ages of vigor and of
decline; but in plants and animals all the parts are in vigor, and all
grow old, at once: in the earth different parts arrive at maturity at
different times by the operation of cold and heat: they grow and decay
on account of the sun and the revolution of the stars, and thus the
parts of the earth acquire different power, so that for a certain time
they remain moist, and then become dry and old: and then other places
are revivified, and become partially watery.” We are, I conceive,
doing no injustice to such speculations by classing them among
<em>fanciful</em> geological opinions.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note100-18"
href="#fnanchor100-18">100</a></span> <i>Meteorol.</i> i. 14.</div>
<p>We must also, I conceive, range in the same division another class
of writers of much more modern times;&#8212;I mean those who have
trained their geology by interpretations of Scripture. I have already
endeavored to show that such an attempt is a perversion of the purpose
of a divine communication, and cannot lead to any physical truth. I do
not here speak of geological speculations in which the Mosaic account
of the deluge has been referred to; for whatever errors may have been
committed on that subject, it would be as absurd to disregard the most
ancient historical record, in attempting to trace back the history of
the earth, as it would be, gratuitously to reject any other <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page584">584</a></span> source of
information. But the interpretations of the account of the creation
have gone further beyond the limits of sound philosophy: and when we
look at the arbitrary and fantastical inventions by which a few
phrases of the writings of Moses have been moulded into complete
systems, we cannot doubt that these interpretations belong to the
present Section.</p>
<p>I shall not attempt to criticize, nor even to enumerate, these
Scriptural Geologies,&#8212;<i>Sacred Theories of the Earth</i>, as
Burnet termed his. Ray, Woodward, Whiston, and many other persons to
whom science has considerable obligations, were involved, by the
speculative habits of their times, in these essays; and they have been
resumed by persons of considerable talent and some knowledge, on
various occasions up to the present day; but the more geology has been
studied on its own proper evidence, the more have geologists seen the
unprofitable character of such labors.</p>
<p>I proceed now to the next step in the progress of Theoretical
Geology.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 3.&#8212;<i>Of Premature Geological
Theories.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">While</span> we were giving our
account of Descriptive Geology, the attentive reader would perceive
that we did, in fact, state several steps in the advance towards
general knowledge; but when, in those cases, the theoretical aspect of
such discoveries softened into an appearance of mere classification,
the occurrence was assigned to the history of Descriptive rather than
of Theoretical Geology. Of such a kind was the establishment, by a
long and vehement controversy, of the fact, that the impressions in
rocks are really the traces of ancient living things; such, again,
were the division of rocks into Primitive, Secondary, Tertiary; the
ascertainment of the orderly succession of organic remains: the
consequent fixation of a standard series of formations and strata; the
establishment of the igneous nature of trap rocks; and the like. These
are geological truths which are assumed and implied in the very
language which geology uses; thus showing how in this, as in all other
sciences, the succeeding steps involve the preceding. But in the
history of geological theory, we have to consider the wider attempts
to combine the facts, and to assign them to their causes.</p>
<p>The close of the last century produced two antagonist theories of
this kind, which long maintained a fierce and doubtful
struggle;&#8212;that of Werner and that of Hutton: the one termed
<i>Neptunian</i>, from its <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page585">585</a></span> ascribing the phenomena of the earth’s
surface mainly to aqueous agency; the other <i>Plutonian</i> or
<i>Vulcanian</i>, because it employed the force of subterraneous fire
as its principal machinery. The circumstance which is most worthy of
notice in these remarkable essays is, the endeavor to give, by means
of such materials as the authors possessed, a complete and simple
account of all the facts of the earth’s history. The Saxon professor,
proceeding on the examination of a small district in Germany,
maintained the existence of a chaotic fluid, from which a series of
universal formations had been precipitated, the position of the strata
being broken up by the falling in of subterraneous cavities, in the
intervals between these depositions. The Scotch philosopher, who had
observed in England and Scotland, thought himself justified in
declaring that the existing causes were sufficient to spread new
strata on the bottom of the ocean, and that they are consolidated,
elevated, and fractured by volcanic heat, so as to give rise to new
continents.</p>
<p>It will hardly be now denied that all that is to remain as
permanent science in each of these systems must be proved by the
examination of many cases and limited by many conditions and
circumstances. Theories so wide and simple, were consistent only with
a comparatively scanty collection of facts, and belong to the early
stage of geological knowledge. In the progress of the science, the
“theory” of each part of the earth must come out of the examination of
that part, combined with all that is well established, concerning all
the rest; and a general theory must result from the comparison of all
such partial theoretical views. Any attempt to snatch it before its
time must fail; and therefore we may venture at present to designate
general theories, like those of Hutton and Werner, as
<i>premature</i>.</p>
<p>This, indeed, is the sentiment of most of the good geologists of
the present day. The time for such general systems, and for the fierce
wars to which the opposition of such generalities gives rise, is
probably now past for ever; and geology will not again witness such a
controversy as that of the Wernerian and Huttonian schools.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page586">586</a></span> The main points really affecting the progress of sound theoretical
geology, will find a place in one of the two next Sections.</p>
<p>[2nd Ed.] [I think I do no injustice to Dr. Hutton in describing
his theory of the earth as <i>premature</i>. Prof. Playfair’s elegant
work, <i>Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory</i> (1802,) so justly
admired, contains many doctrines which the more mature geology of
modern times rejects; such as the igneous origin of chalk-flints,
siliceous pudding stone, and the like; the universal formation of
river-beds by the rivers themselves; and other points. With regard to
this last-mentioned question, I think all who have read Deluc’s
<i>Geologie</i> (1810) will deem his refutation of Playfair
complete.</p>
<p>But though Hutton’s theory was premature, as well as Werner’s, the
former had a far greater value as an important step on the road to
truth. Many of its boldest hypotheses and generalizations have become
a part of the general creed of geologists; and its publication is
perhaps the greatest event which has yet occurred in the progress of
Physical Geology.]</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">The Two Antagonist Doctrines of Geology.</span></h3>
<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Sect.</i> 1.&#8212;<i>Of the Doctrine of
Geological Catastrophes.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THAT</span> great changes, of a kind
and intensity quite different from the common course of events, and
which may therefore properly be called <i>catastrophes</i>, have taken place
upon the earth’s surface, was an opinion which appeared to be forced
upon men by obvious facts. Rejecting, as a mere play of fancy, the
notions of the destruction of the earth by cataclysms or
conflagrations, of which we have already spoken, we find that the
first really scientific examination of the materials of the earth,
that of the Sub-Apennine hills, led men to draw this inference.
Leonardo da Vinci, whom we have already noticed for his early and
strenuous assertion of the real marine origin of fossil impressions of
shells, also maintained that the bottom of the sea had become the top
of the mountain; yet his mode of explaining this may perhaps be
claimed by the modern advocates of uniform causes as more allied to
their <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page587">587</a></span> opinion,
than to the doctrine of catastrophes.<a id="fnanchor101-18"
href="#note101-18"><span class="fnanchor">101</span></a> But Steno, in
1669, approached nearer to this doctrine; for he asserted that Tuscany
must have changed its face at intervals, so as to acquire six
different configurations, by the successive breaking down of the older
strata into inclined positions, and the horizontal deposit of new ones
upon them. Strabo, indeed, at an earlier period had recourse to
earthquakes, to explain the occurrence of shells in mountains; and
Hooke published the same opinion later. But the Italian geologists
prosecuted their researches under the advantage of having, close at
hand, large collections of conspicuous and consistent phenomena.
Lazzaro Moro, in 1740, attempted to apply the theory of earthquakes to
the Italian strata; but both he and his expositor, Cirillo Generelli,
inclined rather to reduce the violence of these operations within the
ordinary course of nature,<a id="fnanchor102-18"
href="#note102-18"><span class="fnanchor">102</span></a> and thus
leant to the doctrine of uniformity, of which we have afterwards to
speak. Moro was encouraged in this line of speculation by the
extraordinary occurrence, as it was deemed by most persons, of the
rise of a new volcanic island from a deep part of the Mediterranean,
near Santorino, in 1707.<a id="fnanchor103-18"
href="#note103-18"><span class="fnanchor">103</span></a> But in other
countries, as the geological facts were studied, the doctrine of
catastrophes appeared to gain ground. Thus in England, where, through
a large part of the country, the coal-measures are extremely inclined
and contorted, and covered over by more horizontal fragmentary beds,
the opinion that some violent catastrophe had occurred to dislocate
them, before the superincumbent strata were deposited, was strongly
held. It was conceived that a period of violent and destructive action
must have succeeded to one of repose; and that, for a time, some
unusual and paroxysmal forces must have been employed in elevating and
breaking the pre-existing strata, and wearing their fragments into
smooth pebbles, before nature subsided into a new age of tranquillity
and vitality. In like manner Cuvier, from the alternations of
fresh-water and salt-water species in the strata of Paris, collected
the opinion of a series of great revolutions, in which “the thread of
induction was broken.” Deluc and others, to whom we owe the first
steps in geological dynamics, attempted carefully to distinguish
between causes now in action, and those which have ceased to act; in
which latter class they reckoned the causes which have <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page588">588</a></span> elevated the existing
continents. This distinction was assented to by many succeeding
geologists. The forces which have raised into the clouds the vast
chains of the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Andes, must have been, it was
deemed, something very different from any agencies now operating.</p>

<p>This opinion was further confirmed by the appearance of a complete
change in the forms of animal and vegetable life, in passing from one
formation to another. The species of which the remains occurred, were
entirely different, it was said, in two successive epochs: a new
creation appears to have intervened; and it was readily believed that
a transition, so entirely out of the common course of the world, might
be accompanied by paroxysms of mechanical energy. Such views prevail
extensively among geologists up to the present time: for instance, in
the comprehensive theoretical generalizations of Elie de Beaumont and
others, respecting mountain-chains, it is supposed that, at certain
vast intervals, systems of mountains, which may be recognized by the
parallelism of course of their inclined beds, have been disturbed and
elevated, lifting up with them the aqueous strata which had been
deposited among them in the intervening periods of tranquillity, and
which are recognized and identified by means of their organic remains:
and according to the adherents of this hypothesis, these sudden
elevations of mountain-chains have been followed, again and again, by
mighty waves, desolating whole regions of the earth.</p>
<p>The peculiar bearing of such opinions upon the progress of physical
geology will be better understood by attending to the <i>doctrine of
uniformity</i>, which is opposed to them, and with the consideration
of which we shall close our survey of this science, the last branch of
our present task.</p>
<h4><i>Sect.</i> 2.&#8212;<i>Of the Doctrine of Geological
Uniformity.</i></h4>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> opinion that the history
of the earth had involved a serious of catastrophes, confirmed by the
two great classes of facts, the symptoms of mechanical violence on a
very large scale, and of complete changes in the living things by
which the earth had been tenanted, took strong hold of the geologists
of England, France, and Germany. Hutton, though he denied that there
was evidence of a beginning of the present state of things, and
referred many processes in the formation of strata to existing causes,
did not assert that the elevatory forces which raise continents from
the bottom of the ocean, were of the same order, <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page589">589</a></span> as well as of the
same kind, with the volcanoes and earthquakes which now shake the
surface. His doctrine of uniformity was founded rather on the supposed
analogy of other lines of speculation, than on the examination of the
amount of changes now going on. “The Author of nature,” it was said,
“has not permitted in His works any symptom of infancy or of old age,
or any sign by which we may estimate either their future or their past
duration:” and the example of the planetary system was referred to in
illustration of this.<a id="fnanchor104-18" href="#note104-18"><span
class="fnanchor">104</span></a> And a general persuasion that the
champions of this theory were not disposed to accept the usual
opinions on the subject of creation, was allowed, perhaps very
unjustly, to weigh strongly against them in the public opinion.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note104-18"
href="#fnanchor104-18">104</a></span> Lyell, i. 4, p. 94.</div>
<p>While the rest of Europe had a decided bias towards the doctrine of
geological catastrophes, the phenomena of Italy, which, as we have
seen, had already tended to soften the rigor of that doctrine, in the
progress of speculation from Steno to Generelli, were destined to
mitigate it still more, by converting to the belief of uniformity
transalpine geologists who had been bred up in the catastrophist
creed. This effect was, indeed, gradual. For a time the distinction of
the <i>recent</i> and the <i>tertiary</i> period was held to be marked
and strong. Brocchi asserted that a large portion of the Sub-Apennine
fossil shells belonged to a living species of the Mediterranean Sea:
but the geologists of the rest of Europe turned an incredulous ear to
this Italian tenet; and the persuasion of the distinction of the
tertiary and the recent period was deeply impressed on most geologists
by the memorable labors of Cuvier and Brongniart on the Paris basin.
Still, as other tertiary deposits were examined, it was found that
they could by no means be considered as contemporaneous, but that they
formed a chain of posts, advancing nearer and nearer to the recent
period. Above the strata of the basins of London and Paris,<a
id="fnanchor105-18" href="#note105-18"><span
class="fnanchor">105</span></a> lie the newer strata of Touraine, of
Bourdeaux, of the valley of the Bormida and the Superga near Turin,
and of the basin of Vienna, explored by M. Constant Prevost. Newer and
higher still than these, are found the Sub-Apennine formations of
Northern Italy, and probably of the same period, the English “crag” of
Norfolk and Suffolk. And most of these marine formations are
associated with volcanic products and fresh-water deposits, so as to
imply apparently a long train of alternations of corresponding
processes. It may easily be supposed that, when the subject had
assumed this form, the boundary of the present and past condition of
the earth <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page590">590</a></span> was
in some measure obscured. But it was not long before a very able
attempt was made to obliterate it altogether. In 1828, Mr. Lyell set
out on a geological tour through France and Italy.<a
id="fnanchor106-18" href="#note106-18"><span
class="fnanchor">106</span></a> He had already conceived the idea of
classing the tertiary groups by reference to the number of recent
species which were found in a fossil state. But as he passed from the
north to the south of Italy, he found, by communication with the best
fossil conchologists, Borelli at Turin, Guidotti at Parma, Costa at
Naples, that the number of extinct species decreased; so that the
last-mentioned naturalist, from an examination of the fossil shells of
Otranto and Calabria, and of the neighboring seas, was of opinion that
few of the tertiary shells were of extinct species. To complete the
series of proof, Mr. Lyell himself explored the strata of Ischia, and
found, 2000 feet above the level of the sea, shells, which were all
pronounced to be of species now inhabiting the Mediterranean; and soon
after, he made collections of a similar description on the flanks of
Etna, in the Val di Noto, and in other places.</p>

<p>The impression produced by these researches is described by
himself.<a id="fnanchor107-18" href="#note107-18"><span

frequently led to reflect on the precept of Descartes, that a
philosopher should once in his life doubt everything he had been
taught; but I still retained so much faith in my early geological
creed as to feel the most lively surprize on visiting Sortino,
Pentalica, Syracuse, and other parts of the Val di Noto, at beholding
a limestone of enormous thickness, filled with recent shells, or
sometimes with mere casts of shells, resting on marl in which shells
of Mediterranean species were imbedded in a high state of
preservation. All idea of [necessarily] attaching a high antiquity to
a regularly-stratified limestone, in which the casts and impressions
of shells alone were visible, vanished at once from my mind. At the
same time, I was struck with the identity of the associated igneous
rocks of the Val di Noto with well-known varieties of ‘trap’ in
Scotland and other parts of Europe; varieties which I had also seen
entering largely into the structure of Etna.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note107-18"
href="#fnanchor107-18">107</a></span> Lyell, 1st ed. Pref. x.</div>
<p>“I occasionally amused myself,” Mr. Lyell adds, “with speculating
on the different rate of progress which geology might have made, had
it been first cultivated with success at Catania, where the phenomena
above alluded to, and the great elevation of the modern tertiary beds
in the Val di Noto, and the changes produced in the historical era by
the Calabrian earthquakes, would have been familiarly known.” <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page591">591</a></span></p>
<p>Before Mr. Lyell entered upon his journey, he had put into the
hands of the printer the first volume of his “Principles of Geology,
being an attempt to explain the former Changes of the Earth’s Surface
<i>by reference to the Causes now in Operation</i>.” And after viewing
such phenomena as we have spoken of, he, no doubt, judged that the
doctrine of catastrophes of a kind entirely different from the
existing course of events, would never have been generally received,
if geologists had at first formed their opinions upon the Sicilian
strata. The boundary separating the present from the anterior state of
things crumbled away; the difference of fossil and recent species had
disappeared, and, at the same time, the changes of position which
marine strata had undergone, although not inferior to those of earlier
geological periods, might be ascribed, it was thought, to the same
kind of earthquakes as those which still agitate that region. Both the
supposed proofs of catastrophic transition, the organical and the
mechanical changes, failed at the same time; the one by the removal of
the fact, the other by the exhibition of the cause. The powers of
earthquakes, even such as they now exist, were, it was supposed, if
allowed to operate for an illimitable time, adequate to produce all
the mechanical effects which the strata of all ages display. And it
was declared that all evidence of a beginning of the present state of
the earth, or of any material alteration in the energy of the forces
by which it has been modified at various epochs, was entirely
wanting.</p>
<p>Other circumstances in the progress of geology tended the same way.
Thus, in cases where there had appeared in one country a sudden and
violent transition from one stratum to the next, it was found, that by
tracing the formations into other countries, the chasm between them
was filled up by intermediate strata; so that the passage became as
gradual and gentle as any other step in the series. For example,
though the conglomerates, which in some parts of England overlie the
coal-measures, appear to have been produced by a complete
discontinuity in the series of changes; yet in the coal-fields of
Yorkshire, Durham, and Cumberland, the transition is smoothed down in
such a way that the two formations pass into each other. A similar
passage is observed in Central-Germany, and in Thuringia is so
complete, that the coal-measures have sometimes been considered as
subordinate to the <i>todtliegendes</i>.<a id="fnanchor108-18"
href="#note108-18"><span class="fnanchor">108</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note108-18"
href="#fnanchor108-18">108</a></span> De la Beche, p. 414,
<i>Manual</i>.</div>
<p>Upon such evidence and such arguments, the doctrine of <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page592">592</a></span> catastrophes was
rejected with some contempt and ridicule; and it was maintained, that
the operation of the causes of geological change may properly and
philosophically be held to have been uniform through all ages and
periods. On this opinion, and the grounds on which it he been urged,
we shall make a few concluding remarks.</p>
<p>It must be granted at once, to the advocates of this geological
uniformity, that we are not arbitrarily to assume the existence of
catastrophes. The degree of uniformity and continuity with which
terremotive forces have acted, must be collected, not from any
gratuitous hypothesis, but from the facts of the case. We must suppose
the causes which have produced geological phenomena, to have been as
similar to existing causes, and as dissimilar, as the effects teach
us. We are to avoid all bias in favor of powers deviating in kind and
degree from those which act at present; a bias which, Mr. Lyell
asserts, has extensively prevailed among geologists.</p>
<p>But when Mr. Lyell goes further, and considers it a merit in a
course of geological speculation that it <em>rejects</em> any
difference between the intensity of existing and of past causes, we
conceive that he errs no less than those whom he censures. “An
<em>earnest and patient endeavor to reconcile</em> the former
indication of change,”<a id="fnanchor109-18" href="#note109-18"><span
class="fnanchor">109</span></a> with <em>any</em> restricted class of
causes,&#8212;a habit which he enjoins,&#8212;is not, we may suggest,
the temper in which science ought to be pursued. The effects must
themselves teach us the nature and intensity of the causes which have
operated; and we are in danger of error, if we seek for slow and shun
violent agencies further than the facts naturally direct us, no less
than if we were parsimonious of time and prodigal of violence.
<em>Time</em>, inexhaustible and ever accumulating his efficacy, can
undoubtedly do much for the theorist in geology; but <em>Force</em>,
whose limits we cannot measure, and whose nature we cannot fathom, is
also a power never to be slighted: and to call in the one to protect
us from the other, is equally presumptuous, to whichever of the two
our superstition leans. To invoke Time, with ten thousand earthquakes,
to overturn and set on edge a mountain-chain, should the phenomena
indicate the change to have been sudden and not successive, would be
ill excused by pleading the obligation of first appealing to known
causes.<a id="fnanchor110-18" href="#note110-18"><span

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note109-18"

ed.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note110-18"
href="#fnanchor110-18">110</a></span> [2nd Ed.] [I have, in the text,
quoted the fourth edition of Mr. Lyell’s <i>Principles</i>, in which
he recommends “an earnest and patient endeavor to reconcile the former
indications of change with the evidence of gradual mutation now in
progress.” In the sixth edition, in that which is, I presume, the
corresponding passage, although it is transferred from the fourth to
the first Book (B. i. c. xiii. p. 325) he recommends, instead, “an
earnest and patient inquiry how far geological appearances are
reconcileable with the effect of changes now in progress.” But while
Mr. Lyell has thus softened the advocate’s character in his language
in this passage, the transposition which I have noticed appears to me
to have an opposite tendency. For in the former edition, the causes
now in action were first described in the second and third Books, and
the great problem of Geology, stated in the first Book, was attempted
to be solved in the fourth. But by incorporating this fourth Book with
the first, and thus prefixing to the study of existing causes
arguments against the belief of their geological insufficiency, there
is an appearance as if the author wished his reader to be prepared by
a previous pleading against the doctrine of catastrophes, before he
went to the study of existing causes. The Doctrines of Catastrophes
and of Uniformity, and the other leading questions of the
Palætiological Sciences, are further discussed in the <i>Philosophy of
the Inductive Sciences</i>, Book x.]</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page593">593</a></span> In truth, we
know causes only by their effects; and in order to learn the nature of
the causes which modify the earth, we must study them through all ages
of their action, and not select arbitrarily the period in which we
live as the standard for all other epochs. The forces which have
produced the Alps and Andes are known to us by experience, no less
than the forces which have raised Etna to its present height; for we
learn their amount in both cases by their results. Why, then, do we
make a merit of using the latter case as a measure for the former? Or
how can we know the true scale of such force, except by comprehending
in our view all the facts which we can bring together?</p>
<p>In reality when we speak of the <em>uniformity</em> of nature, are
we not obliged to use the term in a very large sense, in order to make
the doctrine at all tenable? It includes catastrophes and convulsions
of a very extensive and intense kind; what is the limit to the
violence which we must allow to these changes? In order to enable
ourselves to represent geological causes as operating with uniform
energy through all time, we must measure our time by long cycles, in
which repose and violence alternate; how long may we extend this cycle
of change, the repetition of which we express by the word
<i>uniformity</i>?</p>
<p>And why must we suppose that all our experience, geological as well
as historical, includes more than <em>one</em> such cycle? Why must we
insist upon it, that man has been long enough an observer to obtain
the <em>average</em> of forces which are changing through immeasurable
time? <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page594">594</a></span></p>
<p>The analogy of other sciences has been referred to, as sanctioning
this attempt to refer the whole train of facts to known causes. To
have done this, it has been said, is the glory of Astronomy: she seeks
no hidden virtues, but explains all by the force of gravitation, which
we witness operating at every moment. But let us ask, whether it would
really have been a merit in the founders of Physical Astronomy, to
assume that the celestial revolutions resulted from any selected class
of known causes? When Newton first attempted to explain the motions of
the moon by the force of gravity, and failed because the measures to
which he referred were erroneous, would it have been philosophical in
him, to insist that the difference which he found ought to be
overlooked, since otherwise we should be compelled to go to causes
other than those which we usually witness in action? Or was there any
praise due to those who assumed the celestial forces to be the same
with gravity, rather than to those who assimilated them with any other
known force, as magnetism, till the calculation of the laws and amount
of these forces, from the celestial phenomena, had clearly sanctioned
such an identification? We are not to select a conclusion now well
proved, to persuade ourselves that it would have been wise to assume
it anterior to proof, and to attempt to philosophize in the method
thus recommended.</p>
<p>Again, the analogy of Astronomy has been referred to, as confirming
the assumption of perpetual uniformity. The analysis of the heavenly
motions, it has been said, supplies no trace of a beginning, no
promise of an end. But here, also, this analogy is erroneously
applied. Astronomy, as the science of cyclical motions, has nothing in
common with Geology. But look at Astronomy where she has an analogy
with Geology; consider our knowledge of the heavens as a
palætiological science;&#8212;as the study of a past condition, from
which the present is derived by causes acting in time. Is there then
no evidence of a beginning, or of a progress? What is the import of
the Nebular Hypothesis? A luminous matter is condensing, solid bodies
are forming, are arranging themselves into systems of cyclical motion;
in short, we have exactly what we are told, on this analogy, we ought
not to have;&#8212;the beginning of a world. I will not, to justify
this argument, maintain the truth of the nebular hypothesis; but if
geologists wish to borrow maxims of philosophizing from astronomy,
such speculations as have led to that hypothesis must be their
model.</p>
<p>Or, let them look at any of the other provinces of palætiological
speculation; at the history of states, of civilization, of languages.
We <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page595">595</a></span> may assume
some <em>resemblance</em> or connexion between the principles which
determined the progress of government, or of society, or of
literature, in the earliest ages, and those which now operate; but who
has speculated successfully, assuming an <em>identity</em> of such
causes? Where do we now find a language in the process of formation,
unfolding itself in inflexions, terminations, changes of vowels by
grammatical relations, such as characterize the oldest known
languages? Where do we see a nation, by its natural faculties,
inventing writing, or the arts of life, as we find them in the most
ancient civilized nations? We may assume hypothetically, that man’s
faculties develop themselves in these ways; but we see no such effects
produced by these faculties, in our own time, and now in progress,
without the influence of foreigners.</p>
<p>Is it not clear, in all these cases, that history does not exhibit
a series of cycles, the aggregate of which may be represented as a
uniform state, without indication of origin or termination? Does it
not rather seem evident that, in reality, the whole course of the
world, from the earliest to the present times, is but one cycle, yet
unfinished;&#8212;offering, indeed, no clear evidence of the mode of
its beginning; but still less entitling us to consider it as a
repetition or series of repetitions of what had gone before?</p>
<p>Thus we find, in the analogy of the sciences, no confirmation of
the doctrine of uniformity, as it has been maintained in Geology. Yet
we discern, in this analogy, no ground for resigning our hope, that
future researches, both in Geology and in other palætiological
sciences, may throw much additional light on the question of the
uniform or catastrophic progress of things, and on the earliest
history of the earth and of man. But when we see how wide and complex
is the range of speculation to which our analogy has referred us, we
may well be disposed to pause in our review of science;&#8212;to
survey from our present position the ground that we have passed
over;&#8212;and thus to collect, so far as we may, guidance and
encouragement to enable us to advance in the track which lies before
us.</p>
<p>Before we quit the subject now under consideration, we may,
however, observe, that what the analogy of science really teaches us,
as the most promising means of promoting this science, is the
strenuous cultivation of the two subordinate sciences, Geological
Knowledge of Facts, and Geological Dynamics. These are the two
provinces of knowledge&#8212;corresponding to Phenomenal Astronomy,
and Mathematical Mechanics&#8212;which may lead on to the epoch of the
Newton of <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page596">596</a></span>
geology. We may, indeed, readily believe that we have much to do in
both these departments. While so large a portion of the globe is
geologically unexplored;&#8212;while all the general views which are
to extend our classifications satisfactorily from one hemisphere to
another, from one zone to another, are still unformed; while the
organic fossils of the tropics are almost unknown, and their general
relation to the existing state of things has not even been
conjectured;&#8212;how can we expect to speculate rightly and
securely, respecting the history of the whole of our globe? And if
Geological Classification and Description are thus imperfect, the
knowledge of Geological Causes is still more so. As we have seen, the
necessity and the method of constructing a science of such causes, are
only just beginning to be perceived. Here, then, is the point where
the labors of geologists may be usefully applied; and not in premature
attempts to decide the widest and abstrusest questions which the human
mind can propose to itself.</p>
<p>It has been stated,<a id="fnanchor111-18" href="#note111-18"><span
class="fnanchor">111</span></a> that when the Geological Society of
London was formed, their professed object was to multiply and record
observations, and patiently to await the result at some future time;
and their favorite maxim was, it is added, that the time was not yet
come for a General System of Geology. This was a wise and
philosophical temper, and a due appreciation of their position. And
even now, their task is not yet finished; their mission is not yet
accomplished. They have still much to do, in the way of collecting
Facts; and in entering upon the exact estimation of Causes, they have
only just thrown open the door of a vast Labyrinth, which it may
employ many generations to traverse, but which they must needs
explore, before they can penetrate to the Oracular Chamber of
Truth.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">I rejoice</span>, on many accounts,
to find myself arriving at the termination of the task which I have
attempted. One reason why I am glad to close my history is, that in it
I have been compelled, especially in the latter part of my labors, to
speak as a judge respecting eminent philosophers whom I reverence as
my Teachers in those very sciences on which I have had to pronounce a
judgment;&#8212;if, indeed, even the appellation of Pupil be not too
presumptuous. But I doubt not that such men are as full of candor and
tolerance, as they are of knowledge and thought. And if they deem, as
I did, that such a history of <span class="pagenum"><a

know that it was not only the historian’s privilege, but his duty, to
estimate the import and amount of the advances which he had to
narrate; and if they judge, as I trust they will, that the attempt has
been made with full integrity of intention and no want of labor, they
will look upon the inevitable imperfections of the execution of my
work with indulgence and hope.</p>
<p>There is another source of satisfaction in arriving at this point
of my labors. If, after our long wandering through the region of
physical science, we were left with minds unsatisfied and unraised, to
ask, “Whether this be all?”&#8212;our employment might well be deemed
weary and idle. If it appeared that all the vast labor and intense
thought which has passed under our review had produced nothing but a
barren Knowledge of the external world, or a few Arts ministering
merely to our gratification; or if it seemed that the methods of
arriving at truth, so successfully applied in these cases, aid us not
when we come to the higher aims and prospects of our being;&#8212;this
History might well be estimated as no less melancholy and unprofitable
than those which narrate the wars of states and the wiles of
statesmen. But such, I trust, is not the impression which our survey
has tended to produce. At various points, the researches which we have
followed out, have offered to lead us from matter to mind, from the
external to the internal world; and it was not because the thread of
investigation snapped in our hands, but rather because we were
resolved to confine ourselves, for the present, to the material
sciences, that we did not proceed onwards to subjects of a closer
interest. It will appear, also, I trust, that the most perfect method
of obtaining speculative truth,&#8212;that of which I have had to
relate the result,&#8212;is by no means confined to the least worthy
subjects; but that the Methods of learning what is really true, though
they must assume different aspects in cases where a mere contemplation
of external objects is concerned, and where our own internal world of
thought, feeling, and will, supplies the matter of our speculations,
have yet a unity and harmony throughout all the possible employments
of our minds. To be able to trace such connexions as this, is the
proper sequel, and would be the high reward, of the labor which has
been bestowed on the present work. And if a persuasion of the reality
of such connexions, and a preparation for studying them, have been
conveyed to the reader’s mind while he has been accompanying me
through our long survey, his time may not have been employed on <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page598">598</a></span> these pages in vain.
However vague and hesitating and obscure may be such a persuasion, it
belongs, I doubt not, to the dawning of a better Philosophy, which it
may be my lot, perhaps, to develop more fully hereafter, if permitted
by that Superior Power to whom all sound philosophy directs our
thoughts.</p>

<span class="sc">Sound.</span></h3>
<h4 class="five" id="velocityinwater"><i>The Velocity of Sound in
Water.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> Science of which the
history is narrated in this Book has for its objects, the minute
Vibrations of the parts of bodies such as those by which Sounds are
produced, and the properties of Sounds. The Vibrations of bodies are
the result of a certain tension of their structure which we term
<i>Elasticity</i>. The Elasticity determines the rate of Vibration:
the rate of Vibration determines the audible note: the Elasticity
determines also the velocity with which the vibration travels through
the substance. These points of the subject, Elasticity, Rate of
Vibration, Velocity of Propagation, Audible Note, are connected in
each substance, and are different in different substances.</p>
<p>In the history of this Science, considered as tending to a
satisfactory general theory, the Problems which have obviously offered
themselves were, to explain the properties of Sounds by the relations
of their constituent vibrations; and to explain the existence of
vibrations by the elasticity of the substances in which they occurred:
as in Optics, philosophers have explained the phenomenon of light and
colors by the Undulatory Theory, and are still engaged in explaining
the requisite modulations by means of the elasticity of the Ether. But
the <i>Undulatory Theory of Sound</i> was seen to be true at an early
period of the Science: and the explanation, in a general way at least,
of all kinds of such undulations by means of the elasticity of the
vibrating substances has been performed by a series of mathematicians
of whom I have given an account in this <a href="#v2page23">Book</a>.
Hence the points of the subject already mentioned (Elasticity,
Vibrations and their Propagations, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page600">600</a></span> and Note), have a known material
dependence, and each may be employed in determining the other: for
instance, the Note may be employed in determining the velocity of
sound and the elasticity of the vibrating substance.</p>
<p>Chladni,<a id="fnanchor1-B" href="#note1-B"><span
class="fnanchor">1</span></a> and the Webers,<a id="fnanchor2-B"
href="#note2-B"><span class="fnanchor">2</span></a> had made valuable
experimental inquiries on such subjects. But more complete
investigations of this kind have been conducted with care and skill by
M. Wertheim.<a id="fnanchor3-B" href="#note3-B"><span
class="fnanchor">3</span></a> For instance, he has determined the
velocity with which sound travels in water, by making an organ-pipe to
sound by the passage of water through it. This is a matter of some
difficulty; for the mouthpiece of an organ-pipe, if it be not properly
and carefully constructed, produces sounds of its own, which are not
the genuine musical note of the pipe. And though the note depends
mainly upon the length of the pipe, it depends also, in a small
degree, on the breadth of the pipe and the size of the mouthpiece.</p>

<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note3-B"
href="#fnanchor3-B">3</a></span> <i>Mémoires de Physique
Mécanique</i>. Paris, 1848.</div>
<p>If the pipe were a mere line, the time of a vibration would be the
time in which a vibration travels from one end of the pipe to the
other; and thus the note for a given length (which is determined by
the time of vibration), is connected with the velocity of vibration.
He thus found that the velocity of a vibration along the pipe in
sea-water is 1157 <i>mètres</i> per second.</p>
<p>But M. Wertheim conceived that he had previously shown, by general
mathematical reasoning, that the velocity with which sound travels in
an unlimited expanse of any substance, is to the velocity with which
it travels along a pipe or linear strip of the same substance as the
square root of 3 to the square root of 2. Hence the velocity of sound
in sea-water would be 1454 <i>mètres</i> a second. The velocity of
sound in air is 332 <i>mètres</i>.</p>
<p>M. Wertheim also employed the vibrations of rods of steel and other
metals in order to determine their <i>modulus of
elasticity</i>&#8212;that is, the quantity which determines for each
substance, the extent to which, in virtue of its elasticity, it is
compressed and expanded by given pressures or tensions. For this
purpose he caused the rod to vibrate near to a tuning-fork of given
pitch, so that both the rod and the tuning-fork by their vibrations
traced undulating curves on a revolving disk. The curves traced by the
two could be compared so as to give their relative rate, and thus to
determine the elasticity of the substance.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="sc">I HAVE</span>, at the end of <a
href="#v2page111">Chapter xi.</a>, stated that the theory of which I
have endeavored to sketch the history professes to explain only the
phenomena of radiant visible light; and that though we know that light
has other properties&#8212;for instance, that it produces chemical
effects&#8212;these are not contemplated as included within the domain
of the theory. The chemical effects of light cannot as yet be included
in exact and general truths, such as those which constitute the
undulatory theory of radiant visible light. But though the present age
has not yet attained to a <em>Science</em> of the chemistry of Light,
it has been enriched with a most exquisite <em>Art</em>, which
involves the principles of such a science, and may hereafter be made
the instrument of bringing them into the view of the philosopher. I
speak of the Art of <i>Photography</i>, in which chemistry has
discovered the means of producing surfaces almost as sensitive to the
modifications of light as the most sensitive of organic textures, the
retina of the eye: and has given permanence to images which in the eye
are only momentary impressions. Hereafter, when the laws shall have
been theoretically established, which connect the chemical
constitution of bodies with the action of light upon them, the
prominent names in the Prelude to such an Epoch must be those who by
their insight, invention, and perseverance, discovered and carried to
their present marvellous perfection the processes of photographic
Art:&#8212;Niepce and Daguerre in France, and our own accomplished
countryman, Mr. Fox Talbot.</p>
<h4><i>Fluorescence.</i></h4>
<p>As already remarked, it is not within the province of the
undulatory theory to explain the phenomena of the absorption of light
which take place in various ways when the light is transmitted through
various <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page602">602</a></span>
mediums. I have, at the end of <a href="#v2page65">Chapter iii.</a>,
given the reasons which prevent my assenting to the assertion of a
special analysis of light by absorption. In the same manner, with
regard to other effects produced by media upon light, it is sufficient
for the defence of the theory that it should be consistent with the
possibility of the laws of phenomena which are observed, not that it
should explain those laws; for they belong, apparently, to another
province of philosophy.</p>
<p>Some of the optical properties of bodies which have recently
attracted notice appear to be of this kind. It was noticed by Sir John
Herschel,<a id="fnanchor4-B" href="#note4-B"><span
class="fnanchor">4</span></a> that a certain liquid, sulphate of
quinine, which is under common circumstances colorless, exhibits in
certain aspects and under certain incidences of light, a beautiful
celestial blue color. It appeared that this color proceeded from the
surface on which the light first fell; and color thus produced Sir J.
Herschel called <i>epipolic</i> colors, and spoke of the light as
<i>epipolized</i>. Sir David Brewster had previously noted effects of
color in transparent bodies which he ascribed to internal
dispersion:<a id="fnanchor5-B" href="#note5-B"><span
class="fnanchor">5</span></a> and he conceived that the colors
observed by Sir J. Herschel were of the same class. Professor Stokes<a
id="fnanchor6-B" href="#note6-B"><span class="fnanchor">6</span></a>
of Cambridge applied himself to the examination of these phenomena,
and was led to the conviction that they arise from a power which
certain bodies possess, of changing the color, and with it, the
refrangibility of the rays of light which fall upon them: and he
traced this property in various substances, into various remarkable
consequences. As this change of refrangibility always makes the rays
<em>less</em> refrangible, it was proposed to call it a
<i>degradation</i> of the light; or again, <i>dependent emission</i>,
because the light is emitted in the manner of self-luminous bodies,
but only in dependence upon the active rays, and so long as the body
is under their influence. In this respect it differs from
<i>phosphorescence</i>, in which light is emitted without such
dependence. The phenomenon occurs in a conspicuous and beautiful
manner in certain kinds of fluor spar: and the term
<i>fluorescence</i>, suggested by Professor Stokes, has the advantage
of inserting no hypothesis, and will probably be found the most
generally acceptable.<a id="fnanchor7-B" href="#note7-B"><span

<p>It may be remarked that Professor Stokes rejects altogether the
doctrine that light of definite refrangibility may still be compound,
and maybe analysed by absorption. He says, “I have not overlooked the
remarkable effect of absorbing media in causing apparent changes <span

spectrum; but this I believe to be a subjective phenomenon depending
upon contrast.”</p>

<span class="sc">Undulatory Theory.</span></h3>
<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five"><i>Direction of the Transverse Vibrations in
Polarization.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IN</span> the conclusion of <a
href="#b9-13-11">Chapter xiii.</a> I have stated that there is a point
in the undulatory theory which was regarded as left undecided by Young
and Fresnel, and on which the two different opinions have been
maintained by different mathematicians; namely, whether the vibrations
of polarized light are perpendicular to the plane of polarization or
in that plane. Professor Stokes of Cambridge has attempted to solve
this question in a manner which is, theoretically, exceedingly
ingenious, though it is difficult to make the requisite experiments in
a decisive manner. The method may be briefly described.</p>
<p>If polarized light be <em>diffracted</em> (see Chap. xi. <a
href="#b9-11-2">sect. 2</a>), each ray will be bent from its position,
but will still be polarized. The original ray and the diffracted ray,
thus forming a broken line, may be supposed to be connected at the
angle by a universal joint (called a <i>Hooke’s Joint</i>), such that
when the original ray turns about its axis, the diffracted ray also
turns about its axis; as in the case of the long handle of a telescope
and the screw which is turned by it. Now if the motion of the original
ray round its axis be uniform, the motion of the diffracted ray round
its axis is not uniform: and hence if, in a series of cases, the
planes of polarization of the original ray differ by equal angles, in
the diffracted ray the planes of polarization will differ by unequal
angles. Then if vibrations be perpendicular to the plane of
polarization, the planes of polarization in the diffracted rays will
be crowded together in the neighborhood of the plane in which the
diffraction takes place, and will be more rarely distributed in the
neighborhood of the plane perpendicular to this, in which is the
diffracting thread or groove.</p>
<p>On making the experiment, Prof. Stokes conceived that he found, in
his experiments, such a crowding of the planes of diffracted
polarization towards the plane of diffraction; and thus he held that
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page604">604</a></span> hypothesis
that the transverse vibrations which constitute polarization are
perpendicularly transverse to the plane of polarization was
confirmed.<a id="fnanchor8-B" href="#note8-B"><span

made the experiment in a somewhat different manner, has obtained an
opposite result; so that the point may be regarded as still
doubtful.</p>

<h4><i>Final Disproof of the Emission Theory.</i></h4>
<p>As I have <a href="#v2page107">stated</a> in the History, we cannot
properly say that there ever was an Emission Theory of Light which was
the <em>rival</em> of the Undulatory Theory: for while the undulatory
theory provided explanations of new classes of phenomena as fast as
they arose, and exhibited a <em>consilience</em> of theories in these
explanations, the hypothesis of emitted particles required new
machinery for every new set of facts, and soon ceased to be capable
even of expressing the facts. The simple cases of the ordinary
reflexion and refraction of light were explained by Newton on the
supposition that the transmission of light is the motion of particles:
and though his explanation includes a somewhat harsh assumption (that
a refracting surface exercises an attractive force through a <i>fixed
finite</i> space), the authority of his great name gave it a sort of
permanent notoriety, and made it to be regarded as a standard point of
comparison between a supposed “Emission Theory” and the undulation
theory. And the way in which the theories were to be tested in this
case was obvious: in the Newtonian theory, the velocity of light is
increased by the refracting medium; in the undulatory theory, it is
diminished. On the former hypothesis the velocity of light in air and
in water is as 3 to 4; in the latter, as 4 to 3.</p>
<p>But the immense velocity of light made it appear impossible to
measure it, within the limits of any finite space which we can occupy
with refracting matter. The velocity of light is known from
astronomical phenomena;&#8212;from the eclipses of Jupiter’s
satellites, by which it appears that light occupies 8 minutes in
coming from the sun to the earth; and from the aberration of light, by
which its velocity is shown to be 10,000 times the velocity of the
earth in its orbit. Is it, then, possible to make apparent so small a
difference as that between its passing through a few yards of air and
of water?</p>
<p>Mr. Wheatstone, in 1831, invented a machine by which this could
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page605">605</a></span> be done. His
object was to determine the velocity of the electric shock. His
apparatus consisted in a small mirror, turning with great velocity
about an axis which is in its own plane, like a coin spinning on its
edge. The velocity of spinning may be made so great, that an object
reflected shall change its place perceptibly after an almost
inconceivably small fraction of a second. The application of this
contrivance to measure the velocity of light, was, at the suggestion
of Arago, who had seen the times of the rival theories of light,
undertaken by younger men at Paris, his eyesight not allowing him to
prosecute such a task himself. It was necessary that the mirrors
should turn more than 1000 times in a second, in order that the two
images, produced, one by light coming through air, and the other by
light coming through an equal length of water, should have places
perceptibly different. The mechanical difficulties of the experiment
consisted in keeping up this great velocity by the machinery without
destroying the machinery, and in transmitting the light without too
much enfeebling it. These difficulties were overcome in 1850, by M.
Fizeau and M. Léon Foucault separately: and the result was, that the
velocity of light was found to be less in water than in air. And thus
the Newtonian explanation of refraction, the last remnant of the
Emission Theory, was proved to be false.</p>

<h4><i>Sect.</i> 4.&#8212;<i>Force of Steam.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> experiments on the elastic
force of steam made by the French Academy are fitted in an especial
manner to decide the question between rival formulæ, in consequence of
the great amount of force to which they extend; namely, 60 feet of
mercury, or 24 atmospheres: for formulæ which give results almost
indistinguishable in the lower part of the scale diverge widely at
those elevated points. Mr. Waterston<a id="fnanchor10-B"
href="#note10-B"><span class="fnanchor">10</span></a> has reduced both
these and other experiments to a rule in the following
manner:&#8212;He takes the zero of gaseous tension, determined by
other experimenters (Rudberg, Magnus, and Regnault,) to be 461° below
the zero of Fahrenheit, or 274° below the zero of the centigrade
scale: and temperatures reckoned from this zero he calls “G
temperatures.” The square root of the G temperatures is the element to
which the elastic force is referred (for certain theoretical reasons),
and it is found that the density of steam is as the <i>sixth power</i>
of this element. The agreement of this rule with the special results
is strikingly close. A like rule was found by him to apply generally
to many other gases in contact with their liquids.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note10-B"
href="#fnanchor10-B">10</a></span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1852.</div>
<p>But M. Regnault has recently investigated the subject in the most
complete and ample manner, and has obtained results somewhat
different.<a id="fnanchor11-B" href="#note11-B"><span
class="fnanchor">11</span></a> He is led to the conclusion that no
formula proceeding by <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page607">607</a></span> a power of the temperature can represent
the experiments. He also finds that the rule of Dalton (that as the
temperatures increase in arithmetical progression, the elastic force
increases in geometric progression) deviates from the observations,
especially at high temperatures. Dalton’s rule would be expressed by
saying that the variable part of the elastic force is as
<i>a<sup>t</sup></i>, where <i>t</i> is the temperature. This failing,
M. Regnault makes trial of a formula suggested by M. Biot, consisting
of a sum of two terms, one of which is as <i>a<sup>t</sup></i>, and
the other is <i>b<sup>t</sup></i>: and in this way satisfies the
experiments very closely. But this can only be considered as a formula
of interpolation, and has no theoretical basis. M. Roche had proposed
a formula in which the force is as <i>a<sup>z</sup></i>, <i>z</i>
depending upon the temperature by an equation<a id="fnanchor12-B"
href="#note12-B"><span class="fnanchor">12</span></a> to which he had
been led by theoretical considerations. This agrees better with
observation than any other formula which includes only the same number
of coefficients.</p>

required to convert a pint of water at a temperature of zero into
steam, is the same whatever be the pressure.” Also, the Law of
Southern, that “the latent heat of vaporization, that is the heat
absorbed in the passage from the liquid to the gaseous consistence, is
constant for all purposes: and that we obtain the total heat in adding
to the constant latent heat the number which represents the latent
heat of steam.” Southern found the latent heat of the steam of water
to be represented by about 950 degrees of Fahrenheit.<a

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">I may</span> notice, as important
additions to our knowledge on this subject, the results of four
balloon ascents made in 1852,<a id="fnanchor15-B"
href="#note15-B"><span class="fnanchor">15</span></a> by the Committee
of the Meteorological Observatory established at Kew by the British
Association for the Advancement of Science. In these ascents the
observers mounted to more than 13,000, 18,000, and 19,000 feet, and in
the last to 22,370; by which ascent the temperature fell from 49
degrees to nearly 10 degrees below zero; and the dew-point fell from
37° to 12°. Perhaps the most marked result of these observations is
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page608">608</a></span>
following:&#8212;The temperature of the air decreases uniformly as we
ascend above the earth’s surface; but this decrease does not go on
continuously. At a certain elevation, varying on different days, the
decrease is arrested: and for a depth of two or three thousand feet of
air, the temperature decreases little, or even increases in ascending.
Above this, the diminution again takes place at nearly the same rate
as in the lower regions. This intermediate region of undecreasing
temperature extended in the various ascents, from about altitude 4000
to 6000 feet, 6500 to 10,000, 2000 to 4500, and 4000 to 8000. This
interruption in the decrease of temperature is accompanied by a large
and abrupt fall in the temperature of the dew-point, or by an actual
condensation of vapor. Thus, this region is the <i>region of the
clouds</i>, and the increase of heat appears to arise from the latent
heat liberated when aqueous vapor is formed into clouds.</p>

<hr class="one" />
<h4 class="five" id="bb10-4"><i>The Dynamical Theory of Heat.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THAT</span> the transmission of
<em>radiant</em> Heat takes place by means of the vibrations of a
medium, as the transmission of Sound certainly does, and the
transmission of Light most probably, is a theory which, as I have
endeavored to explain, has strong arguments and analogies in its
favor. But that Heat itself, in its essence and quantity, is Motion is
a hypothesis of quite another kind. This hypothesis has been recently
asserted and maintained with great ability. The doctrine thus asserted
is, that Motion may be converted into Heat, and Heat into Motion; that
Heat and Motion may produce each other, as we see in the rarefaction
and condensation of air, in steam-engines, and the like: and that in
all such cases the Motion produced and the Heat expended exactly
measure each other. The foundation of this theory is conceived to have
been laid by Mr. Joule of Manchester, in 1844: and it has since been
prosecuted by him and by Professor Thomson of Glasgow, by experimental
investigations of various kinds. It is difficult to make these
experiments so as to be quite satisfactory; for it is <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page609">609</a></span> difficult to measure
<em>all</em> the heat gained or lost in any of the changes here
contemplated. That friction, agitation of fluids, condensation of
gases, conversion of gases into fluids and liquids into solids,
produce heat, is undoubted: and that the quantity of such heat may be
measured by the mechanical force which produces it, or which it
produces, is a generalization which will very likely be found a
fertile source of new propositions, and probably of important
consequences.</p>
<p>As an example of the conclusions which Professor Thomson draws from
this doctrine of the mutual conversion of motion and heat, I may
mention his speculations concerning the cause which produces and
sustains the heat of the sun.<a id="fnanchor16-B"
href="#note16-B"><span class="fnanchor">16</span></a> He conceives
that the support of the solar heat must be meteoric matter which is
perpetually falling towards the globe of the sun, and has its motion
converted into heat. He inclines to think that the meteors containing
the stores of energy for future Sun-light must be principally within
the earth’s orbit; and that we actually see them there as the
“Zodiacal Light,” an illuminated shower, or rather tornado, of stones.
The inner parts of this tornado are always getting caught in the Sun’s
atmosphere, and drawn to his mass by gravitation.</p>

<h3>GENERAL REMARKS.</h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">ELECTRICITY</span> in the form in
which it was originally studied&#8212;Franklinic, frictional, or
statical electricity&#8212;has been so completely identified with
electricity in its more comprehensive form&#8212;Voltaic, chemical, or
dynamical electricity&#8212;that any additions we might have to make
to the history of the earlier form of the subject are included in the
later science.</p>
<p>There are, however, several subjects which may still be regarded
rather as branches of Electricity than of the Cognate Sciences. Such
are, for instance, Atmospheric Electricity, with all that belongs to
Thunderstorms and Lightning Conductors. The observation of Atmospheric
Electricity has been prosecuted with great zeal at various
meteorological observatories; and especially at the Observatory
established by the British Association at Kew. The Aurora Borealis,
again, is plainly an electrical phenomenon; but probably belonging
rather to dynamical than to statical electricity. For it strongly
affects the magnetic needle, and its position has reference to the
direction of magnetism; but it has not been observed to affect the
electroscope. The general features of this phenomenon have been
described by M. de Humboldt, and more recently by M. de Bravais; and
theories of the mode of its production have been propounded by MM.
Biot, De la Rive, Kaemtz, and others.</p>
<p>Again, there are several fishes which have the power of giving an
electrical shock:&#8212;the torpedo, the gymnotus, and the silurus.
The agency of these creatures has been identified with electricity in
the most general sense. The peculiar energy of the animal has been
made to produce the effects which are produced by an electrical
discharge or a voltaic current:&#8212;not only to destroy life in
small animals, but to <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page611">611</a></span> deflect a magnet, to make a magnet, to
decompose water, and to produce a spark.</p>
<h4><i>Dr. Faraday’s Views of Statical Electric Induction.</i></h4>
<p>According to the theories of electricity of Æpinus and Coulomb,
which in this Book of our History are regarded as constituting a main
part of the progress of this portion of science, the particles of the
electric fluid or fluids exert forces, attractive and repulsive, upon
each other in straight lines at a distance, in the same way in which,
in the Newtonian theory of the universe, the particles of matter are
conceived as exerting attractive forces upon each other. An electrized
body presented a conducting body of any form, determines a new
arrangement of the electric fluids in the conductor, attracting the
like fluid to its own side, and repelling the opposite fluid to the
opposite side. This is Electrical <i>Induction</i>. And as, by the
theory, the attraction is greater at the smaller distances, the
distribution of the fluid upon the conductor in virtue of this
Induction will not be symmetrical, but will be governed by laws which
it will require a complex and difficult calculation to
determine&#8212;as we have seen was the case in the investigations of
Coulomb, Poisson, and others.</p>
<p>Instead of this action at a distance. Dr. Faraday has been led to
conceive Electrical Induction to be the result of an action taking
place between the electrized body and the conductor through lines of
contiguous particles in the mass of the intermediate body, which he
calls the <i>Dielectric</i>. And the irregularities of the
distribution of the electricity in these cases of Induction, and
indeed the existence of an action in points protected from direct
action by the protuberant sides of the conductor, are the causes, I
conceive, which lead him to the conclusion that Induction takes place
in <em>curved lines</em><a id="fnanchor17-B" href="#note17-B"><span
class="fnanchor">17</span></a> of such contiguous particles.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note17-B"
href="#fnanchor17-B">17</a></span> <i>Researches</i>, 1165,
&amp;c.</div>
<p>With reference to this, I may remark that, as I have said, the
distribution of electricity on a conductor in the presence of an
electrized body is so complex a mathematical problem that I do not
conceive any merely popular way of regarding the result can entitle us
to say, that the distribution which we find cannot be explained by the
Coulombian theory, and must force us upon the assumption of an action
in curved lines:&#8212;which is, indeed, itself a theory, and so vague
a one <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page612">612</a></span> that it
requires to be made much more precise before we can say what
consequences it does or does not lead to. Professor W. Thomson has
arrived at a mathematical proof that the effect of induction on the
view of Coulomb and of Faraday must, under certain conditions, be
necessarily and universally the same.</p>
<p>With regard to the influence of different <i>Dielectrics</i> upon
Induction, the inquiry appears to be of the highest importance; and
may certainly necessitate some addition to the theory.</p>

<h4 class="five"><i>Recent Progress of Terrestrial Magnetism.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">IN</span> Chapter II., I have <a
href="#terrestrial">noticed</a> the history of Terrestrial Magnetism;
Hansteen’s map published in 1819; the discovery of “magnetic storms”
about 1825; the chain of associated magnetic observations, suggested
by M. de Humboldt, and promoted by the British Association and the
Royal Society; the demand for the continuation of these till 1848; the
magnetic observations made in several voyages; the magnetic surveys of
various countries. And I have spoken also of Gauss’s theory of
Terrestrial Magnetism, and his directions and requirements concerning
the observations to be made. I may add a few words with regard to the
more recent progress of the subject.</p>
<p>The magnetic observations made over large portions of the Earth’s
surface by various persons, and on the Ocean by British officers, have
been transmitted to Woolwich, where they have been employed by General
Sabine in constructing magnetic maps of the Earth for the year 1840.<a
id="fnanchor18-B" href="#note18-B"><span
class="fnanchor">18</span></a> Following the course of inquiry
described in the part of the history referred to, these maps exhibit
the declination, inclination, and intensity of the magnetic force at
every point of the earth’s surface. The curves which mark equal
amounts of each of these three elements (the <i>lines of equal
declination</i>, <i>inclination</i>, and <i>force</i>:&#8212;the
<i>isogonal</i>, the <i>isoclinal</i>, and the <i>isodynamic</i>
lines,) are, in their general form, complex and irregular; and it has
been made a matter of question (the facts being agreed upon) whether
it be more proper to say that they indicate four poles, as Halley and
as Hansteen said, or only two poles, as Gauss asserts. The matter
appears to become more clear if we draw magnetic <i>meridians</i>;
that is, lines obtained by following the directions, or pointings, of
the magnetic needle to the north or to <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page614">614</a></span> the south, till we arrive at the points
of convergence of all their directions; for there are only two such
poles, one in the Arctic and one in the Antarctic region. But in
consequence of the irregularity of the magnetic constitution of the
earth, if we follow the inclination of the magnetic force round the
earth on any parallel of latitude, we find that it has two
<i>maxima</i> and two <i>minima</i>, as if there were four magnetic
poles. The isodynamic map is a new presentation of the facts of this
subject; the first having been constructed by Colonel Sabine in
1837.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note18-B"
href="#fnanchor18-B">18</a></span> These maps are published in Mr.
Keith Johnstone’s <i>Physical Atlas</i>.</div>
<p>I have stated also that the magnetic elements at each place are to
be observed in such a manner as to bring into view both their
<i>periodical</i>, their <i>secular</i>, and their <i>irregular</i> or
<i>occasional</i> changes. The observations made at Toronto in Canada,
and at Hobart Town in Van Diemen’s Land, two stations at equal
distances from the two poles of the earth, and also at St Helena, a
station within the tropics, have been discussed by General Sabine with
great care, and with an amount of labor approaching to that employed
upon reductions of astronomical observations. And the results have
been curious and unexpected.</p>
<p>The declination was first examined.<a id="fnanchor19-B"
href="#note19-B"><span class="fnanchor">19</span></a> This magnetical
element is, as we have already seen (<a href="#v2page232">p. 232</a>),
liable both to a diurnal and to an annual inequality; and also to
irregular perturbations which have been termed magnetic storms. Now it
was found that all these inequalities went on increasing gradually and
steadily from 1843 to 1848, so as to become, at the end of that time,
above twice as large as they were at the beginning of it. A new
periodical change in all these elements appeared to be clearly
established by this examination. M. Lamont, of Munich, had already
remarked indications of a decennial period in the diurnal variation of
the declination of the needle. The duration of the period from minimum
to maximum being about five years, and therefore the whole period
about ten years. The same conclusion was found to follow still more
decidedly from the observations of the dip and intensity.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note19-B"
href="#fnanchor19-B">19</a></span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1852 and
1856.</div>
<p>This period of ten years had no familiar meaning in astronomy; and
if none such had been found for it, its occurrence as a magnetic
period must have been regarded, as General Sabine says,<a
id="fnanchor20-B" href="#note20-B"><span
class="fnanchor">20</span></a> in the light of a fragmentary fact. But
it happened about this time that the scientific world was made aware
of the existence of a like period in a <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page615">615</a></span> phenomenon which no one would have
guessed to be connected with terrestrial magnetism, namely, the spots
in the Sun. M. Schwabe, of Dessau, had observed the Sun’s disk with
immense perseverance for 24 years:&#8212;often examining it more than
300 days in the year; and had found that the spots had, as to their
quantity and frequency, a periodical character. The years of maximum
are 1828, 1838, 1848, in which there were respectively 225,<a
id="fnanchor21-B" href="#note21-B"><span
class="fnanchor">21</span></a> 282, 330 groups of spots. The minimum
years, 1833, 1843, had only 33 and 34 such groups. This curious fact<a
id="fnanchor22-B" href="#note22-B"><span
class="fnanchor">22</span></a> was first made public by M. de
Humboldt, in the third volume of his <i>Kosmos</i> (1850). The
coincidence of the periods and epochs of these two classes of facts
was pointed out by General Sabine in a Memoir presented to the Royal
Society in March, 1852.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note20-B"
href="#fnanchor20-B">20</a></span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1856, p.
382.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note21-B"
href="#fnanchor21-B">21</a></span> In 1837 there were 333.</div>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note22-B"
href="#fnanchor22-B">22</a></span> The observations up to 1844 were
published in Poggendorf’s <i>Annalen</i>.</div>
<p>Of course it was natural to suppose, even before this discovery,
that the diurnal and annual inequalities of the magnetic element at
each place depend upon the action of the sun, in some way or
other.</p>
<p>Dr. Faraday had endeavored to point out how the effect of the solar
heat upon the atmosphere would, according to the known relations of
heat and magnetism, explain many of the phenomena. But this new
feature of the phenomena, their quinquennial increase and decrease,
makes us doubt whether such an explanation can really be the true
one.</p>
<p>Of the <em>secular</em> changes in the magnetic elements, not much
more is known than was known some years ago. These changes go on, but
their laws are imperfectly known, and their causes not even
conjectured. M. Hansteen, in a recent memoir,<a id="fnanchor23-B"
href="#note23-B"><span class="fnanchor">23</span></a> says that the
decrease of the inclination goes on progressively diminishing. With us
this rate of decrease appears to be at present nearly uniform. We
cannot help conjecturing that the sun, which has so plain a connexion
with the diurnal, annual, and occasional movements of the needle, must
also have some connexion with its secular movements.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note23-B"
href="#fnanchor23-B">23</a></span> See K. Johnstone’s <i>Physical
Atlas</i>.</div>
<p>In 1840 the observations made at various places had to a great
extent enabled Gauss, in connexion with W. Weber, to apply his Theory
to the actual condition of the Earth;<a id="fnanchor24-B"
href="#note24-B"><span class="fnanchor">24</span></a>  and he
calculated the Declination, Inclination, and Intensity at above 100
places, and found <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page616">616</a></span> the agreement, as he says, far beyond
his hopes. They show, he says, that the Theory comes near to the
Truth.</p>

<h4 id="compass"><i>Correction of Ship’s Compasses.</i></h4>
<p>The magnetic needle had become of importance when it was found that
it always pointed to the North. Since that time the history of
magnetism has had its events reflected in the history of navigation.
The change of the declination arising from a change of place terrified
the companions of Columbus. The determination of the laws of this
change was the object of the voyage of Halley; and has been pursued
with the utmost energy in the Arctic and Antarctic regions by
navigators up to the present time. Probably the dependence of the
magnetic declination upon place is now known well enough for the
purposes of navigation. But a new source of difficulty has in the
meantime come into view; the effect of the iron in the ship upon the
Compass. And this has gone on increasing as guns, cables, stays,
knees, have been made of iron; then steam-engines with funnels,
wheels, and screws, have been added; and finally the whole ship has
been made of iron. How can the compass be trusted in such cases?</p>
<p>I have already <a href="#v2page223">said</a> in the history that
Mr. Barlow proposed to correct the error of the compass by placing
near to the compass an iron plate, which from its proximity to the
compass might counterbalance magnetically the whole effect of the
ship’s iron upon the compass. This correction was not effectual,
because the magnetic forces of the plate and of the ship do not change
their direction and value according to the same law, with the change
of position. I have further stated that Mr. Airy devised other means
of correcting the error. I may add a few words on the subject; for the
subject has been further examined by Mr. Airy<a id="fnanchor25-B"
href="#note25-B"><span class="fnanchor">25</span></a> and by
others.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note25-B"
href="#fnanchor25-B">25</a></span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1856.</div>
<p>It appears, by mathematical reasoning, that the magnetic effect of
the iron in a ship may be regarded as producing two kinds of deviation
which are added together;&#8212;a “polar-magnet deviation,” which
changes from positive to negative as the direction of the ship’s keel,
in a horizontal revolution, passes from semicircle to semicircle; and
a “quadrantal deviation,” which changes from positive to negative as
the keel turns from quadrant to quadrant. The latter deviation may be
remedied completely by a mass of unmagnetized iron placed on a level
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page617">617</a></span> with the
compass, either in the athwartship line or in the fore-and-aft line,
according to circumstances. “The polar-magnet-deviation” may be
corrected at <em>any given place</em> by a magnet or magnets, but the
magnets thus applied at one place will not always correct the
deviation in another magnetic latitude. For it appears that this
deviation arises partly from a magnetism inherent in the materials of
the ship, not changing with the change of magnetic position, and
partly from the effect of terrestrial magnetism upon the ship’s iron.
But the errors arising from both sources may be remedied by adjusting,
at a new locality, the positions of the corrective magnets.</p>
<p>The inherent magnetism of the ship, of which I have spoken, may be
much affected by the position in which the ship was built; and may
change from time to time; for instance, by the effect of the battering
of the waves, and other causes. Hence it is called by Mr. Airy
“sub-permanent magnetism.”</p>
<p>Another method of correcting the errors of a ship’s compass has
been proposed, and is used to some extent; namely, by <i>swinging</i>
the ship round (in harbor) to all points of azimuth, and thus
constructing a <i>Table of Compass Errors</i> for that particular
ship. But to this method it is objected that the Table loses its value
in a new magnetic latitude much more than the correction by magnets
does; besides the inconveniences of steering a ship by a Table.</p>

<span class="sc">Magneto-electric Induction.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">FARADAY’S</span> discovery that, in
combinations like those in which a voltaic current was known to
produce motion, motion would produce a voltaic current, naturally
excited great attention among the scientific men of Europe. The
general nature of his discovery was communicated by letter<a
id="fnanchor26-B" href="#note26-B"><span
class="fnanchor">26</span></a> to M. Hachette at Paris, in December,
1831; and experiments having the like results were forthwith made by
MM. Becquerel and Ampère at Paris, and MM. Nobili and Antinori at
Florence.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note26-B"
href="#fnanchor26-B">26</a></span> <i>Ann. de Chimie</i>, vol. xlviii.
(1831), p. 402.</div>
<p>It was natural also that in a case in which the relations of space
which determine the results are so complicated, different philosophers
should look at them in different ways. There had been, from the first
discovery by Oersted of the effect of a voltaic current upon a magnet,
two rival methods of regarding the facts. Electric and magnetic lines
exert an effort to place themselves transverse to each other (see <a
href="#b13-4">chapter iv.</a> of this Book), and (as I have already
said) two ways offered themselves of simplifying this general
truth:&#8212;to suppose an electric current made up of transverse
magnetic lines; or to suppose magnetic lines made up of transverse
electric currents. On either of these assumptions, the result was
expressed by saying that <em>like</em> currents or lines (electric or
magnetic) tend to place themselves parallel; which is a law more
generally intelligible than the law of transverse position. Faraday
had adopted the former view; had taken the lines of magnetic force for
the fundamental lines of his system, and defined the direction of the
magneto-electric current of induction by the relation <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page619">619</a></span> of the motion to
these lines. Ampère, on the other hand, supposed the magnet to be made
up of transverse electric currents (<a href="#v2page246">chap.
vi.</a>); and had deduced all the facts of electro-dynamical action,
with great felicity, from this conception. The question naturally
arose, in what manner, on this view, were the new facts of
magneto-electric induction by motion to be explained, or even
expressed?</p>
<p>Various philosophers attempted to answer this question. Perhaps the
form in which the answer has obtained most general acceptance is that
in which it was put by Lenz, who discoursed on the subject to the
Academy of St. Petersburg in 1833.<a id="fnanchor27-B"
href="#note27-B"><span class="fnanchor">27</span></a> His general rule
is to this effect: when a wire moves in the neighborhood of an
electric current or a magnet, a current takes place in it, such as,
existing independently, would have produced a motion opposite to the
actual motion. Thus two parallel <i>forward</i> currents move towards
each other:&#8212;hence if a current move towards a parallel wire, it
produces in it a <i>backward</i> current. A moveable wire conducting a
current <i>downwards</i> will move round the north pole of a magnet in
the direction N., W., S., E.:&#8212;hence if, when the wire have in it
no current, we move it in the direction N., W., S., E., we produce in
the wire an <i>upward</i> current. And thus, as M. de la Rive
remarks,<a id="fnanchor28-B" href="#note28-B"><span
class="fnanchor">28</span></a> in cases in which the mutual action of
two currents produces a limited motion, as attraction or repulsion, or
a deviation right or left, the corresponding magneto-electric
induction produces an instantaneous current only; but when the
electrodynamic action produces a continued motion, the corresponding
motion produces, by induction, a continued current.</p>

<p>Looking at this mode of stating the law, it is impossible not to
regard this effect as a sort of reaction; and accordingly, this view
was at once taken of it. Professor Ritchie said, in 1833, “The law is
founded on the universal principle that action and reaction are
equal.” Thus, if voltaic electricity induce magnetism under certain
arrangements, magnetism will, by similar arrangements, react on a
conductor and induce voltaic electricity.<a id="fnanchor29-B"

<p>There are still other ways of looking at this matter. I have
elsewhere pointed out that where polar properties co-exist, they are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page620">620</a></span> generally found
to be connected,<a id="fnanchor30-B" href="#note30-B"><span

case of electrical, magnetical, and chemical polarities. If we regard
motion backwards and forwards, to the right and the left, and the
like, as <em>polar</em> relations, we see that magneto-electric
induction gives us a new manifestation of connected polarities.</p>

<p class="center space-above"><i>Diamagnetic Polarity</i>.</p>
<p>But the manifestation of co-existent polarities which are brought
into view in this most curious department of nature is not yet
exhausted by those which we have described. I have already spoken (<a
href="#diamagnetism">chap. <span class="correction" title="emended
from iv.">vii.</span></a>) of Dr. Faraday’s discovery that there are
diamagnetic as well as magnetic bodies; bodies which are repelled by
the pole of a magnet, as well as bodies which are attracted. Here is a
new opposition of properties. What is the exact definition of this
opposition in connexion with other polarities? To this, at present,
different philosophers give different answers. Some say that
diamagnetism is completely the opposite of ordinary magnetism, or, as
Dr. Faraday has termed it for the sake of distinction, of
<i>paramagnetism</i>. They say that as a north pole of a magnet gives
to the neighboring extremity of a piece of soft iron a south pole, so
it gives to the neighboring extremity of a piece of bismuth a north
pole, and that the bismuth becomes for a time an inverted magnet; and
hence, arranges itself across the line of magnetised force, instead of
along it. Dr. Faraday himself at first adopted this view;<a
id="fnanchor31-B" href="#note31-B"><span
class="fnanchor">31</span></a> but he now conceives that the bismuth
is not made polar, but is simply repelled by the magnet; and that the
transverse position which it assumes, arises merely from its elongated
form, each end trying to recede as far as possible from the repulsive
pole of the magnet.</p>

<p>Several philosophers of great eminence, however, who have examined
the subject with great care, adhere to Dr. Faraday’s first view of the
nature of Diamagnetism&#8212;as W. Weber,<a id="fnanchor32-B"
href="#note32-B"><span class="fnanchor">32</span></a> Plücker, and Mr.
Tyndall among ourselves. If we translate this view into the language
of Ampère’s theory, it comes to this:&#8212;that as currents are
induced in iron and magnetics parallel to those existing in the
inducing magnet or battery wire; so in bismuth, heavy glass, and other
diamagnetic bodies, the currents induced are in the contrary <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page621">621</a></span>
directions:&#8212;these hypothetical currents being in non-conducting
diamagnetic, as in magnetic bodies, not in the mass, but round the
particles of the matter.</p>

<h4><i>Magneto-optic Effects and Magnecrystallic Polarity.</i></h4>
<p>Not even yet have we terminated the enumeration of the co-existent
polarities which in this province of nature have been brought into
view. Light has polar properties; the very term <i>polarization</i> is
the record of the discovery of these. The forces which determine the
crystalline forms of bodies are of a polar nature: crystalline forms,
when complete, may be defined as those forms which have a certain
degree of symmetry in reference to opposite poles. Now has this
optical and crystalline polarity any relation to the electrical
polarity of which we have been speaking?</p>
<p>However much we might be disposed beforehand to conjecture that
there is some relation between these two groups of polar properties,
yet in this as in the other parts of this history of discoveries
respecting polarities, no conjecture hits the nature of the relation,
such as experiment showed it to be. In November, 1846, Faraday
announced the discovery of what he then called “the action of magnets
on light.” But this action was manifested, not on light directly, but
on light passing through certain kinds of glass.<a id="fnanchor33-B"
href="#note33-B"><span class="fnanchor">33</span></a> When this glass,
subjected to the action of the powerful magnets which he used,
transmitted a ray of light parallel to the line of magnetic force, an
effect was produced upon the light. But of what nature was this
effect? When light was ordinary light, no change in its condition was
discoverable. But if the light were light polarized in any plane, the
plane of polarization was turned round through a certain angle while
the ray passed through the glass:&#8212;a greater angle, in proportion
as the magnetic force was greater, and the thickness of the glass
greater.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note33-B"

<i>Researches</i>, § 2151, &amp;c. Also flint glass, rock salt, water
(2215).</div>
<p>A power in some respects of this kind, namely, a power to rotate
the plane of polarization of a ray passing through them, is possessed
by some bodies in their natural state; for instance, quartz crystals,
and oil of turpentine. But yet, as Dr. Faraday remarks,<a
id="fnanchor34-B" href="#note34-B"><span
class="fnanchor">34</span></a> there is a great difference in the two
cases. When polarized rays pass through oil of turpentine, in whatever
direction they pass, they all of them have their <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page622">622</a></span> plane of polarization
rotated in the same direction; that is, all to the right or all to the
left; but when a ray passes through the heavy glass, the power of
rotation exists only in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic line,
and its direction as right or left-handed is reversed by reversing the
magnetic polarity.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note34-B"
href="#fnanchor34-B">34</a></span> <i>Researches</i>, Art. 2231.</div>
<p>In this case, we have optical properties, which do not depend on
crystalline form, affected by the magnetic force. But it has also been
found that crystalline form, which is so fertile a source of optical
properties, affords indications of magnetic forces. In 1847, M.
Plücker,<a id="fnanchor35-B" href="#note35-B"><span
class="fnanchor">35</span></a> of the University of Bonn, using a
powerful magnetic apparatus, similar to Faraday’s, found that crystals
in general are magnetic, in this sense, that the axes of crystalline
form tend to assume a certain position with reference to the magnetic
lines of force. The possession of one optic axis or of two is one of
the broad distinctions of the different crystalline forms: and using
this distinction, M. Plücker found that a crystal having a single
optic axis tends to place itself with this axis transverse to the
magnetic line of force, as if its optic axis were repelled by each
magnetic pole; and crystals with two axes act as if each of these axes
were repelled by the magnetic poles. This force is independent of the
magnetic or diamagnetic character of the crystal; and is a directive,
more properly than an attractive or repulsive force.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note35-B"
href="#fnanchor35-B">35</a></span> Taylor’s <i>Scientific Memoirs</i>,
vol. v.</div>
<p>Soon afterwards (in 1848) Faraday also discovered<a
id="fnanchor36-B" href="#note36-B"><span
class="fnanchor">36</span></a> an effect of magnetism depending on
crystalline form, which at first sight appeared to be different from
the effects observed by M. Plücker. He found that a crystal of
bismuth, of which the form is nearly a cube, but more truly a
rhombohedron with one diagonal a little longer than the others, tends
to place itself with this diagonal in the direction of the lines of
magnetic force. At first he conceived<a id="fnanchor37-B"
href="#note37-B"><span class="fnanchor">37</span></a> the properties
thus detected to be different from those observed by M. Plücker; since
in this case the force of a crystalline axis is axial, whereas in
those, it was equatorial. But a further consideration of the subject,
led him<a id="fnanchor38-B" href="#note38-B"><span
class="fnanchor">38</span></a> to a conviction that these forces must
be fundamentally identical: for it was easy to conceive a combination
of bismuth crystals which would behave in the magnetic field as a
crystal of calcspar does; or a combination of calcspar crystals which
would behave as a crystal of bismuth does.</p>

<p>And thus we have fresh examples to show that the Connexion of
coexistent Polarities is a thought deeply seated in the minds of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page623">623</a></span> profoundest and
most sagacious philosophers, and perpetually verified and illustrated,
by unforeseen discoveries in unguessed forms, through the labors of
the most skilful experimenters.</p>
<h4><i>Magneto-electric Machines.</i></h4>
<p>The discovery that a voltaic wire moved in presence of a magnet,
has a current generated in it, was employed as the ground of the
construction of machines to produce electrical effects. In Saxton’s
machine two coils of wire including a core of soft iron revolved
opposite to the ends of a horseshoe magnet, and thus, as the two coils
came opposite to the N. and S. and to the S. and N. poles of the
magnet, currents were generated alternately in the wires in opposite
directions. But by arranging the connexions of the ends of the wires,
the successive currents might be made to pass in corresponding
directions. The alternations or successions of currents in such
machines are governed by a contrivance which alternately interrupts
and permits the action; this contrivance has been called a
<i>rheotome</i>. Clarke gave a new form to a machine of the same
nature as Saxton’s. But the like effect may be produced by using an
electro-magnet instead of a common magnet. When this is done, a
current is produced which by induction produces a current in another
wire, and the action is alternately excited and interrupted. When the
inducing current is interrupted, a momentary current <em>in an
opposite direction</em> is produced in the induced wire; and when this
current stops, it produces in the inducing wire a current <em>in the
original direction</em>, which may be adjusted so as to reinforce the
resumed action of the original current. This was pointed out by M. De
la Rive in 1843.<a id="fnanchor39-B" href="#note39-B"><span
class="fnanchor">39</span></a> Machines have been constructed on such
principles by him and others. Of such machines the most powerful
hitherto known is that constructed by M. Ruhmkorff. The effects of
this instrument are exceedingly energetic.</p>

<h4><i>Applications of Electrodynamic Discoveries.</i></h4>
<p>The great series of discoveries of which I have had to speak have
been applied in many important ways to the uses of life. The
<i>Electric Telegraph</i> is one of the most remarkable of these. By
wires extended to the most distant places, the electric current is
transmitted <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page624">624</a></span>
thither in an imperceptible time; and by means of well-devised systems
of operation, is made to convey from man to man words, which are now
most emphatically “winged words.” In the most civilised states such
wires now form a net-work across the land, which is familiar to our
thoughts as the highway is to our feet; and wide seas have such
pathways of human thought buried deep in their waves from shore to
shore. Again, by using the chemical effects of electrodynamic action,
of which we shall have to speak in the next <a href="#b13-9">Book</a>,
a new means has been obtained of copying, with an exactness
unattainable before, any forms which art or nature has produced, and
of covering them with a surface of metal. The <i>Electrotype
Process</i> is now one of the great powers which manufacturing art
employs.</p>
<p>But these discoveries have also been employed in explaining natural
phenomena, the causes of which had before been altogether inscrutable.
This is the case with regard to the diurnal variation of the magnetic
needle; a fact  which as to its existence is universal in all places,
and which yet is so curiously diverse in its course at different
places. Dr. Faraday has shown that some of the most remarkable of
these diversities, and probably all, seem to be accounted for by the
different magnetic effects of air at different temperatures: although,
as I have already said, <span class="correction" title="emended from
[">(</span><a href="#v2page614">Book xii.</a>) the discovery of a
decennial period in the diurnal changes of magnetic declination shows
that any explanation of those changes which refers them to causes
existing in the atmosphere must be very incomplete.<a

<h3>CHAPTER IX.<br /><br />
<span class="sc">The Electro-chemical Theory.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">AMONG</span> the consequences of the
Electro-chemical Theory, must be ranged the various improvements which
have been made in the voltaic battery. Daniel introduced between the
two metals a partition permeable by chemical action, but such as to
allow of two different acid solutions being in contact with the two
metals. Mr. Grove’s battery, in which the partition is of porous
porcelain, and the metals are platinum and amalgamated zinc, is one of
the most powerful hitherto known. Another has been constructed by Dr.
Callan, in which the negative or conducting plate is a cylinder of
cast iron, and the positive element a cylinder of amalgamated zinc
placed in a porous cell. This also has great energy.</p>
<h4><i>The Number of Elementary Substances.</i></h4>
<p>There have not been, I believe, any well-established additions to
the list of the simple substances recognized by chemists. Indeed the
tendency at present appears to be rather to deny the separate
elementary character of some already announced as such substances.
Pelopium and Niobium were, as I have said, two of the new metals. But
Naumann, in his <i>Elemente der Mineralogie</i> (4th ed. 1855), says,
in a foot note (page 25): “<i>Pelopium</i> is happily again got rid
of; for Pelopic Acid and Niobic Acid possess the same Radical.
<i>Donarium</i> had a still shorter existence.”</p>
<p>In the same way, when Hermann imagined that he had discovered a new
simple metallic substance in the mineral Samarskite from Miask, the
discovery was disproved by H. Rose (<i>Pogg. Ann.</i> B. 73, s. 449).
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page626">626</a></span></p>
<p>In general the insulation of the new simple substances, the
metallic bases of the earths, and the like,&#8212;their separation
from their combinations, and the exhibition of them in a metallic
form&#8212;has been a difficult chemical process, and has rarely been
executed on any considerable scale. But in the case of
<i>Aluminium</i>, the basis of the earth Alumina, the process of its
extraction has recently been so much facilitated, that the metal can
be produced in abundance. This being the case, it will probably soon
be applied to special economical uses, for which it is fitted by
possessing special properties.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="sc">BY</span> the kindness of W. H.
Miller, Esq., Professor of Mineralogy in the University of Cambridge,
I am able to add to this part the following notices of books and
memoirs.</p>
<h4>1. <i>Crystallography.</i></h4>
<p><i>Elemente der Krystallographie, nebst einer tabellarischen
Uebersicht der Mineralien nach der Krystallformen</i>, von Gustav
Rose. 2. Auflage. Berlin, 1838. The crystallographic method here
adopted is, for the most part, that of Weiss. The method of this work
has been followed in</p>
<p><i>A System of Crystallography, with its Applications to
Mineralogy</i>. By John Joseph Griffin. Glasgow, 1841. Mr. Griffin
has, however, modified the notation of Rose. He has constructed a
series of models of crystalline forms.</p>
<p>Frankenheim’s <i>System der Krystalle</i>. 1842. This work adopts
nearly the Mohsian systems of crystallization. It contains Tables of
the chemical constitution, inclinations of the axis, and magnitude of
the axes of all the crystals of which a description was to be found,
including those formed in the laboratory, as well as those usually
called minerals; 713 in all.</p>
<p>Fr. Aug. Quenstedt, <i>Methode der Krystallographie</i>, 1840,
employs a fanciful method of representing a crystal by projecting upon
one face of the crystal all the other faces. This invention appears to
be more curious than useful.</p>
<p>Dr. Karl Naumann, who is spoken of in Chap. <a href="#v2page352">ix.</a> of this Book, as the
author of the best of the Mixed Systems of Classification, published
also <i>Grundriss der Krystallographie</i>, Leipzig, 1826. In this and
other works he modifies the notation of Mohs in a very advantageous
manner. <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page628">628</a></span></p>
<p>Professor Dana, in his <i>System of Mineralogy</i>, New Haven
(U.S.), 1837, follows Naumann for the most part, both in
crystallography and in mineral classification. In the latter part of
the subject, he has made the attempt, which in all cases is a source
of confusion and of failure, to introduce a whole system of new names
of the members of his classification.</p>
<p>The geometry of crystallography has been investigated in a very
original manner by M. Bravais, in papers published in the Journal of
the Ecole Polytechnique, entitled <i>Mémoires sur les Systèmes formés
par des Points</i>. 1850. <i>Etudes Crystallographiques</i>. 1851.</p>
<p>Hermann Kopp (<i>Einleitung in die Krystallographie</i>,
Braunschweig. 1849) has given the description and measurement of the
angles of a large number of laboratory crystals.</p>
<p>Rammelsberg (<i>Krystallographische Chemie</i>, Berlin, 1855) has
collected an account of the systems, simple forms and angles of all
the laboratory crystals of which he could obtain descriptions.</p>
<p>Schabus of Vienna (<i>Bestimmung der Krystallgestalten <span
class="correction" title="not in italics in text">in</span> Chemischen
Laboratorien erzeugten Producte</i>, Wien, 1855; a successful Prize
Essay) has given a description, accompanied by measurements, of 90
crystalline species from his own observations.</p>
<p>To these attempts made in other countries to simplify and improve
crystallography, I may add a remarkable Essay very recently made here
by Mr. Brooke, and suggested to him by his exact and familiar
knowledge of Mineralogy. It is to this effect. All the crystalline
forms of any given mineral species are derived from the <i>primitive
form</i> of that species; and the degree of symmetry, and the
<i>parameters</i>, of this form determine the angles of all derivative
forms. But how is this primitive form selected and its parameters
determined? The selection of the kind of the primitive form depends
upon the <i>degree of symmetry</i> which appears in all the derivative
forms; according to which they belong to the <i>rhombohedral</i>,
<i>prismatic</i>, <i>square pyramidal</i>, or some other
<i>system</i>: and this determination is commonly clear. But the
parameters, or the angles, of the primitive form, are commonly
determined by the <i>cleavage</i> of the mineral. Is this a sufficient
and necessary ground of such determination? May not a simplification
be effected, in some cases, by taking some other parameters? by taking
a primitive form which belongs to the proper system, but which has
some other angles than those given by cleavage? Mr. Brooke has tried
whether, for instance, crystals of the rhombohedral system may not be
referred with advantage to primitive rhombohedrons which have, in all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page629">629</a></span> the species,
nearly the same angles. The advantage to be obtained by such a change
would be the simplification of the laws of derivation in the
derivative forms: and therefore we have to ask, whether the indices of
derivation are smaller numbers in this way or with the hitherto
accepted fundamental angles. It appears to me, from the examples
given, that the advantage of simplicity in the indices is on the side
of the old system: but whether this be so or not, it was a great
benefit to crystallography to have the two methods compared. Mr.
Brooke’s Essay is a Memoir presented to the Royal Society in 1856.</p>
<h4>2. <i>Optical Properties of Minerals.</i></h4>
<p>The <i>Handbuch der Optik</i>, von F. W. G. Radicke, Berlin, 1839,
contains a chapter on the optical properties of crystals. The author’s
chief authority is Sir D. Brewster, as might be expected.</p>
<p>M. Haidinger has devoted much attention to experiments on the
<i>pleochroism</i> of minerals. He has invented an instrument which
makes the dichroism of minerals more evident by exhibiting the two
colors side by side.</p>
<p>The pleochroism of minerals, and especially the remarkable clouds
that in the cases of Iolite, Andalusite, Augite, Epidote, and Axinite,
border the positions of either optical axis, have been most
successfully imitated by M. de Senarmont by means of artificial
crystallizations. (<i>Ann. de Chim.</i> 3 <i>Ser.</i> xli. p.
319.)</p>
<p>M. Pasteur has found that Racemic Acid consists of two different
acids, having the same density and composition. The salts of these
acids, with bases of Ammonia and of Potassa, are hemihedral, the
hemihedral faces which occur in the one being wanting in the other.
The acids of these different crystals have circular polarization of
opposite kinds. (<i>Ann. de Chim.</i> 3 <i>Ser.</i> xxviii. 56, 99.)
This discovery was marked by the assignation of the Rumford Medal to
M. Pasteur in 1856.</p>
<p>M. Marbach has discovered that crystals of chlorate of soda, which
apparently belongs to the cubic or tessular system, exhibit hemihedral
faces of a peculiar character; and that the crystals have circular
polarization of opposite kinds in accordance with the differences of
the plagihedral faces. (<i>Poggendorf’s Annalen</i>, xci. 482.)</p>
<p>M. Seybolt of Vienna has found a means of detecting plagihedral
faces in quartz crystals which do not reveal them externally.
(<i>Akad. d. Wissenschaft zu Wien</i>, B. xv. s. 59.) <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page630">630</a></span></p>
<h4>3. <i>Classification of Minerals.</i></h4>
<p>In the <i>Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences</i>, B. <span
class="sc">viii</span>. C. iii., I have treated of the Application of
the Natural-history Method of Classification to Mineralogy, and have
spoken of the Systems of this kind which have been proposed. I have
there especially discussed the system proposed in the treatise of M.
Necker, <i>Le Règne Minéral ramené aux Méthodes d’Histoire
Naturelle</i> (Paris, 1835). More recently have been published M.
Beudant’s <i>Cours élémentaire d’Histoire Naturelle, Minéralogie</i>
(Paris, 1841); and M. A. Dufresnoy’s <i>Traité de Minéralogie</i>
(Paris, 1845). Both these works are so far governed by mere chemical
views that they lapse into the inconveniences and defects which are
avoided in the best systems of German mineralogists.</p>
<p>The last mineral system of Berzelius has been developed by M.
Rammelsberg (Nürnberg, 1847). It is in principle such as we have
described it in the history.</p>
<p>M. <span class="correction" title="emended from
Nordenskiold’s">Nordenskiöld’s</span> system (3rd Ed. 1849,) has been
criticised by G. Rose, who observes that it removes the defects of the
system of Berzelius only in part. He himself proposes what he calls a
“Krystallo-Chemisches System,” in which the crystalline form
determines the genus and the chemical composition the species. His
classes are&#8212;</p>
<p>1. Simple Substances.</p>
<p>2. Combinations of Sulphur, Selenium, Titanium, Arsenic,
Antimony.</p>
<p>3. Chlorides, Fluorides, Bromides, Iodides.</p>
<p>4. Combinations with Oxygen.</p>
<p>We have already said that for us, all chemical compounds are
<i>minerals</i>, in so far that they are included in our
classifications. The propriety of this mode of dealing with the
subject is confirmed by our finding that there is really no tenable
distinction between native minerals and the products of the
laboratory. A great number of eminent chemists have been employed in
producing, by artificial means, crystals which had before been known
only as native products.</p>

<h3>BOTANY.</h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">FOR</span> the purpose of giving to
my reader some indication of the present tendency of Botanical
Science, I conceive that I cannot do better than direct his attention
to the reflections, procedure, and reasonings which have been
suggested by the most recent extensions of man’s knowledge of the
vegetable world. And as a specimen of these, I may take the labors of
Dr. Joseph Hooker, on the Flora of the Antarctic Regions,<a
id="fnanchor41-B" href="#note41-B"><span
class="fnanchor">41</span></a> and especially of New Zealand. Dr.
Hooker was the Botanist to an expedition commanded by Sir James Ross,
sent out mainly for the purpose of investigating the phenomena of
Terrestrial Magnetism near the South Pole; but directed also to the
improvement of Natural History. The extension of botanical
descriptions and classifications to a large mass of new objects
necessarily suggests wider views of the value of classes (genera,
species, &amp;c.,) and the conclusions to be drawn from their
constancy or inconstancy. A few of Dr. Hooker’s remarks may show the
nature of the views taken under such circumstances.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note41-B"
href="#fnanchor41-B">41</a></span> <i>The Botany of the Antarctic
Voyage of H. M. Discovery Ships Erebus and Terror, in the years</i>
1839&#8211;40. Published 1847. <i>Flora Novæ Zelandiæ</i>. 1853.</div>
<p>I may notice, in the first place, (since this work is intended for
general rather than for scientific readers,) Dr. Hooker’s testimony to
the value of a technical descriptive language for a classificatory
science&#8212;a Terminology, as it is called. He says, “It is
impossible to write Botanical descriptions which a person ignorant of
Botany can understand, although it is supposed by many unacquainted
with science that this can and should be done.” And hence, he says,
the state of botanical science demands Latin descriptions of the
plants; and this is a lesson which he especially urges upon the
Colonists who study the indigenous plants. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page632">632</a></span></p>
<p>Dr. Hooker’s remarks on the limits of species, their dispersion and
variation, are striking and instructive. He is of opinion that species
vary more, and are more widely diffused, than is usually supposed.
Hence he conceives that the number of species has been needlessly and
erroneously multiplied, by distinguishing the specimens which occur in
different places, and vary in unessential features. He says that
though, according to the lowest estimate of compilers, 100,000 is the
commonly received number of known plants, he thinks that half that
number is much nearer the truth. “This,” he says, “may be well
conceived, when it is notorious that nineteen species have been made
of the Common Potatoe, and many more of <i>Solanum nigrum</i> alone.
<i>Pteris aquilina</i> has given rise to numerous book species;
<i>Vernonia cinerea</i> of India to fifteen at least. . . . . . . Many
more plants are common to most countries than is supposed; I have
found 60 New Zealand flowering plants and 9 Ferns to be European ones,
besides inhabiting numerous intermediate countries. . . . . . So long
ago as 1814, Mr. Brown drew attention to the importance of such
considerations, and gave a list of 150 European plants common to
Australia.”</p>
<p>As an example of the extent to which unessential differences may
go, he says (p. xvii.,) “The few remaining native Cedars of Lebanon
may be abnormal states of the tree which was once spread over the
whole of the Lebanon; for there are now growing in England varieties
of it which have no existence in a wild state. Some of them closely
resemble the Cedars of Atlas and of the Himalayas (<i>Deodar</i>;) and
the absence of any valid botanical differences tends to prove that
all, though generally supposed to be different species, are one.”</p>
<p>Still the great majority of the species of plants in those Southern
regions are peculiar. “There are upwards of 100 genera, subgenera, or
other well marked groups of plants, entirely or nearly confined to New
Zealand, Australia, and extra-tropical South America. They are
represented by one or more species in two or more of those countries,
and thus effect a botanical relationship or affinity between them all
which every botanist appreciates.”</p>
<p>In reference to the History of Botany, I have received corrections
and remarks from Dr. Hooker, with which I am allowed to enrich my
pages.</p>

Monocotyledonous and Dicotyledonous:&#8212;’Floriferas dividemus in
<span class="sc">Dicotyledones</span>, quarum semina sata binis
foliis, seminalibus dictis, quæ cotyledonorum usum præstant, e terra
exeunt, vel in binos saltem lobos dividuntur, quamvis eos supra terram

efferunt nec lobos binos condunt. Hæc divisio ad arbores etiam extendi
potest; siquidem Palmæ et congeneres hoc respectu eodem modo a
reliquis arboribus differunt quo Monocotyledones a reliquis
herbis.’</p>
<p>“P. <a href="#v2page408">408</a>. <i>Endogenous and Exogenous Growth.</i> The exact course
of the wood fibres which traverse the stems of both Monocotyledonous
and Dicotyledonous plants has been only lately discovered. In the
Monocotyledons, those fibres are collected in bundles, which follow a
very peculiar course:&#8212;from the base of each leaf they may be
followed downwards and inwards, towards the axis of the trunk, when
they form an arch with the convexity to the centre; and curving
outwards again reach the circumference, where they are lost amongst
the previously deposited fibres. The intrusion of the bases of these
bundles amongst those already deposited, causes the circumference of
the stem to be harder than the centre; and as all these arcs have a
short course (their chords being nearly equal), the trunk does not
increase in girth, and grows at the apex only. The wood-bundles are
here definite. In the Dicotyledonous trunks, the layers of wood run in
parallel courses from the base to the top of the trunk, each
externally to that last formed, and the trunk increases both in height
and girth; the wood-bundles are here indefinite.</p>
<p>“With regard to the Cotyledons, though it is often difficult to
distinguish a Monocotyledonous Embryo from a Dicotyledonous, they may
always be discriminated when germinating. The Cotyledons, when two or
more, and primordial leaves (when no Cotyledons are visible) of a
Monocotyledon, are alternate; those of a Dicotyledon are opposite.</p>
<p>“A further physiological distinction between Monocotyledons and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page634">634</a></span> Dicotyledons is
observed in germination, when the Dicotyledonous radicle elongates and
forms the root of the young plant; the Monocotyledonous radicle does
not elongate, but pushes out rootlets from itself at once. Hence the
not very good terms, <i>exorhizal</i> for Dicotyledonous, and
<i>endorhizal</i> for Monocotyledonous.</p>
<p>“The highest physiological generalization in the vegetable kingdom
is between <i>Phænogama</i> and <i>Cryptogama</i>. In the former,
fertilization is effected by a pollen-tube touching the nucleus of an
ovule; in Cryptogams, the same process is effected by the contact of a
sperm-cell, usually ciliated (<i>antherozoid</i>), upon another kind
of cell called a germ-cell. In Phænogams, further, the organs of
fructification are all modified leaves; those of Cryptogams are not
homologous.” (J. D. H.)</p>
<h3>ZOOLOGY.</h3>
<p>I have exemplified the considerations which govern zoological
classification by quoting the reflexions which Cuvier gives us, as
having led him to his own classification of Fishes. Since the
varieties of Quadrupeds, or <i>Mammals</i> (omitting whales, &amp;c.),
are more familiar to the common reader than those of Fishes, I may
notice some of the steps in their classification; the more so as some
curious questions have recently arisen thereupon.</p>
<p>Linnæus first divides Mammals into two groups, as they have Claws,
or Hoofs (<i>unguiculata</i>, <i>ungulata</i>.) But he then again
divides them into six orders (omitting whales, &amp;c.), according to
their number of <i>incisor</i>, <i>laniary</i>, and <i>molar</i>
teeth; namely:&#8212;</p>
<p><i>Primates</i>. (Man, Monkey, &amp;c.)</p>
<p><i>Bruta</i>. (Rhinoceros, Elephant, &amp;c.)</p>
<p><i>Feræ</i>. (Dog, Cat, Bear, Mole, &amp;c.)</p>
<p><i>Glires</i>. (Mouse, Squirrel, Hare, &amp;c.)</p>
<p><i>Pecora</i>. (Camel, Giraffe, Stag, Goat, Sheep, Ox, &amp;c.)</p>
<p><i>Belluæ</i>. (Horse, Hippopotamus, Tapir, Sow, &amp;c.)</p>
<p>In the place of these, Cuvier, as I have stated in the
<i>Philosophy</i> (<i>On the Language of Sciences</i>, Aphorism xvi.),
introduced the following orders: <i>Bimanes</i>, <i>Quadrumanes</i>,
<i>Carnassiers</i>, <i>Rongeurs</i>, <i>Edentés</i>,
<i>Pachyderms</i>, <i>Ruminans</i>. Of these, the <i>Carnassiers</i>
correspond to the <i>Feræ</i> of Linnæus; the <i>Rongeurs</i> to his
<i>Glires</i>; the <i>Edentés</i> are a new order, taking the Sloths,
Ant-eaters, &amp;c., from the <i>Bruta</i> of Linnæus, the Megatherium
from extinct animals, and the Ornithorhynchus, &amp;c., from the new
animals of Australia; the <i>Ruminans</i> agree with the <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page635">635</a></span> <i>Pecora</i>; the
<i>Pachyderms</i> include some of the <i>Bruta</i> and the
<i>Belluæ</i>, comprehending also extinct animals, as
<i>Anoplotherium</i> and <i>Palæotherium</i>.</p>
<p>But the two orders of Hoofed Animals, the Pachyderms and the
Ruminants, form a group which is held by Mr. Owen to admit of a better
separation, on the ground of a character already pointed out by
Cuvier; namely, as to whether they are <i>two-toed</i> or
<i>three-toed</i>. According to this view, the Horse is connected with
the Tapir, the Palæotherium, and the Rhinoceros, not only by his
teeth, but by his feet, for he has really three digits. And Cuvier
notices that in the two-toed or even-toed Pachyderms, the astragalus
bone has its face divided into two equal parts by a ridge; while in
the uneven-toed pachyderms it has a narrow cuboid face. Mr. Owen has
adopted this division of Pachyderms and Ruminants, giving the names
<i>artiodactyla</i> and <i>perissodactyla</i> to the two groups; the
former including the Ox, Hog, Peccary, Hippopotamus, &amp;c.; the
latter comprehending the Horse, Tapir, Rhinoceros, Hyrax, &amp;c. And
thus the Ruminants take their place as a subordinate group of the
great natural even-toed Division of the Hoofed Section of Mammals; and
the Horse is widely separated from them, inasmuch as he belongs to the
odd-toed division.<a id="fnanchor42-B" href="#note42-B"><span
class="fnanchor">42</span></a></p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note42-B"
href="#fnanchor42-B">42</a></span> Owen, <i>Odontography</i>.</div>
<p>As we have seen, these modern classifications are so constructed as
to include extinct as well as living species of animals; and indeed
the species which have been discovered in a fossil state have tended
to fill up the gaps in the series of zoological forms which had marred
the systems of modern zoologists. This has been the case with the
division of which we are speaking.</p>
<p>Mr. Owen had established two genera of extinct Herbivorous Animals,
on the strength of fossil remains brought from South
America:&#8212;<i>Toxodon</i>, and <i>Nesodon</i>. In a recent
communication to the Royal Society<a id="fnanchor43-B"
href="#note43-B"><span class="fnanchor">43</span></a> he has
considered the bearing of these genera upon the divisions of odd-toed
and even-toed animals. He had already been led to the opinion that the
three sections, <i>Proboscidea</i>, <i>Perissodactyla</i>, and
<i>Artiodactyla</i>, formed a natural division of Ungulata; and he is
now led to think that this division implies another group, “a distinct
division of the <i>Ungulata</i>, of equal value, if not with the
<i>Perissodactyla</i> and <i>Artiodactyla</i> at least with the
<i>Proboscidea</i>. This group he proposes to call
<i>Toxodonta</i>.</p>

<h4 class="five"><i>Morphology in Linnæus.</i></h4>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">I HAVE</span> stated that Linnæus had
some views on this subject. Dr. Hooker conceives these views to be
more complete and correct than is generally allowed, though unhappily
clothed in metaphorical language and mixed with speculative matter. By
his permission I insert some remarks which I have received from
him.</p>
<p>The fundamental passage on this subject is in the <i>Systema
Naturæ</i>; in the Introduction to which work the following passage
occurs:&#8212;</p>
<p>“Prolepsis (Anticipation) exhibits the mystery of the metamorphosis
of plants, by which the herb, which is the <i>larva</i> or imperfect
condition, is changed into the declared fructification: for the plant
is capable of producing either a leafy herb or a fructification. . . .
. .</p>
<p>“When a tree produces a flower, nature anticipates the produce of
five years where these come out all at once; forming of the bud-leaves
of the next year <i>bracts</i>; of those of the following year, the
<i>calyx</i>; of the following, the <i>corolla</i>; of the next, the
<i>stamina</i>; of the subsequent, the <i>pistils</i>, filled with the
granulated marrow of the seed, the terminus of the life of a
vegetable.”</p>
<p>Dr. Hooker says, “I derive my idea of his having a better knowledge
of the subject than most Botanists admit, not only from the Prolepsis,
but from his paper called <i>Reformatio Botanices</i> (<i>Amœn.
Acad.</i> vol. vi.); a remarkable work, in respect of his candor in
speaking of his predecessors’ labors, and the sagacity he shows in
indicating researches to be undertaken or completed. Amongst the
latter is V. ‘Prolepsis plantarum, ulterius extendenda per earum
metamorphoses.’ The last word occurs rarely in his <i>Prolepsis</i>;
but when it does it seems to me that he uses it as indicating a normal
change and not an accidental one. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page637">637</a></span></p>
<p>“In the <i>Prolepsis</i> the speculative matter, which Linnæus
himself carefully distinguishes as such, must be separated from the
rest, and this may I think be done in most of the sections. He starts
with explaining clearly and well the origin and position of buds, and
their constant presence, whether developed or not, in the axil of the
leaf: adding abundance of acute observations and experiments to prove
his statements. The leaf he declares to be the first effort of the
plant in spring: he proceeds to show, successively, that bracts,
calyx, corolla, stamens, and pistil are each of them metamorphosed
leaves, in every case giving <span class="sc">many examples</span>,
both from monsters and from characters presented by those organs in
their normal condition.</p>
<p>“The (to me) obscure and critical part of the <i>Prolepsis</i> was
that relating to the change of the style of <i>Carduus</i> into two
leaves. Mr. Brown has explained this. He says it was a puzzle to him,
till he went to Upsala and consulted Fries and Wahlenberg, who
informed him that such monstrous <i>Cardui</i> grew in the
neighborhood, and procured him some. Considering how minute and masked
the organs of <i>Compositæ</i> are, it shows no little skill in
Linnæus, and a very clear view of the whole matter, to have traced the
metamorphosis of all their floral organs into leaves, except their
stamens, of which he says, ‘Sexti anni folia e staminibus me non in
compositis vidisse fateor, sed illorum loco folia pistillacea, quæ in
compositis aut plenis sunt frequentissima.’ I must say that nothing
could well be clearer to my mind than the full and accurate
appreciation which Linnæus shows of the whole series of phenomena, and
their <em>rationale</em>. He over and over again asserts that these
organs are leaves, every one of them,&#8212;I do not understand him to
say that the prolepsis is an accidental change of leaves into bracts,
of bracts into calyx, and so forth. Even were the language more
obscure, much might be inferred from the wide range and accuracy of
the observations he details so scientifically. It is inconceivable
that a man should have traced the sequence of the phenomena under so
many varied aspects, and shown such skill, knowledge, ingenuity, and
accuracy in his methods of observing and describing, and yet missed
the <em>rationale</em> of the whole. Eliminate the speculative parts
and there is not a single error of observation or judgment; whilst his
history of the developement of buds, leaves, and floral organs, and of
various other obscure matters of equal interest and importance, are of
a very high order of merit, are, in fact, for the time profound.</p>
<p>“There is nothing in all this that detracts from the merit of
Goethe’s <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page638">638</a></span>
re-discovery. With Goethe it was, I think, a deductive
process,&#8212;with Linnæus an inductive. Analyse Linnæus’s
observations and method, and I think it will prove a good example of
inductive reasoning.</p>
<p>“P. <a href="#v2page473">473</a>. Perhaps Professor Auguste St Hilaire of Montpellier should
share with De Candolle the honor of contributing largely to establish
the metamorphic doctrine;&#8212;their labors were cotemporaneous.</p>
<p>“P. <a href="#v2page474"><span class="correction" title="emended from 390">474</span></a>. Linnæus pointed out that the pappus was calyx: ‘Et
<i>pappum</i> gigni ex quarti anni foliis, in jam nominatis
Carduis.’&#8212;<i>Prol. Plant.</i> 338.” (<i>J. D. H.</i>)</p>

<span class="sc">Animal Morphology.</span></h3>
<p class="drop"><span class="sc">THE</span> subject of Animal
Morphology has recently been expanded into a form strikingly
comprehensive and systematic by Mr. Owen; and supplied by him with a
copious and carefully-chosen language; which in his hands facilitates
vastly the comparison and appreciation of the previous labors of
physiologists, and opens the way to new truths and philosophical
generalizations. Though the steps which have been made had been
prepared by previous anatomists, I will borrow my view of them mainly
from him; with the less scruple, inasmuch as he has brought into full
view the labors of his predecessors.</p>
<p>I have <a href="#v2page475">stated</a> in the History that the
skeletons of all vertebrate animals are conceived to be reducible to a
single Type, and the skull reducible to a series of vertebræ. But
inasmuch as this reduction includes not only a detailed correspondence
of the bones of man with those of beasts, but also with those of
birds, fishes, and reptiles, it may easily be conceived that the
similarities and connexions are of a various and often remote kind.
The views of such relations, held by previous Comparative Anatomists,
have led to the designations of the bones of animals which have been
employed in anatomical descriptions; and these designations having
been framed and adopted by anatomists looking at the subject from
different sides, and having different views of analogies and
relations, have been very various and unstable; besides being often of
cumbrous length and inconvenient form.</p>
<p>The corresponding parts in different animals are called
<i>homologues</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page639">639</a></span> a term first applied to anatomy by the
philosophers of Germany; and this term Mr. Owen adopts, to the
exclusion of terms more loosely denoting identity or similarity. And
the Homology of the various bones of vertebrates having been in a
great degree determined by the labors of previous anatomists, Mr. Owen
has proposed names for each of the bones: the condition of such names
being, that the homologues in all vertebrates shall be called by the
same name, and that these names shall be founded upon the terms and
phrases in which the great anatomists of the 16th, 17th, and 18th
centuries expressed the results of their researches respecting the
human skeleton. These names, thus selected, so far as concerned the
bones of the Head of Fishes, one of the most difficult cases of this
Special Homology, he published in a Table,<a id="fnanchor44-B"
href="#note44-B"><span class="fnanchor">44</span></a> in which they
were compared, in parallel columns, with the names or phrases used for
the like purpose by Cuvier, Agassiz, Geoffroy, Hallman, Sœmmering,
Meckel, and Wagner. As an example of the considerations by which this
selection of names was determined, I may quote what he says with
regard to one of these bones of the skull.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note44-B"
href="#fnanchor44-B">44</a></span> <i>Lectures on Vertebrates</i>.
1846, p. 158. And <i>On the Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate
Skeleton</i>. 1848, p. 172.</div>
<p>“With regard to the ‘squamosal’ (<i>squamosum</i>. Lat. pars
squamosa ossis temporis.&#8212;Sœmmering), it might be asked why the
term ‘temporal’ might not be retained for this bone. I reply, because
that term has long been, and is now universally, understood in human
anatomy to signify a peculiarly anthropotomical coalesced congeries of
bones, which includes the ‘squamosal’ together with the ‘petrosal,’
the ‘tympanic,’ the ‘mastoid,’ and the ‘stylohyal.’ It seems
preferable, therefore, to restrict the signification of the term
‘temporal’ to the whole (in Man) of which the ‘squamosal’ is a part.
To this part Cuvier has unfortunately applied the term ‘temporal’ in
one class, and ‘jugal’ in another; and he has also transferred the
term ‘temporal’ to a third equally distinct bone in fishes; while to
increase the confusion M. Agassiz has shifted the name to a fourth
different bone in the skull of fishes. Whatever, therefore, may be the
value assigned to the arguments which will be presently set forth, as
to the special homologies of the ‘pars squamosa ossis temporis,’ I
have felt compelled to express the conclusion by a definite term, and
in the present instance, have selected that which recalls the best
accepted anthropomorphical designation of the part; although
‘squamosal’ must be understood and applied in an arbitrary sense; and
not as descriptive of a scale-like <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page640">640</a></span> form; which in reference to the bone so
called, is rather its exceptional than normal figure in the vertebrate
series.”</p>
<p>The principles which Mr. Owen here adopts in the selection of names
for the parts of the skeleton are wise and temperate. They agree with
the aphorisms concerning the language of science which I published in
the <i>Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences</i>; and Mr. Owen does me
the great honor of quoting with approval some of those Aphorisms. I
may perhaps take the liberty of remarking that the system of terms
which he has constructed, may, according to our principles, be called
rather a <i>Terminology</i> <span class="correction" title="emended
from then">than</span> a <i>Nomenclature</i>: that is, they are
analogous more nearly to the <i>terms</i> by which botanists describe
the parts and organs of plants, than to the <i>names</i> by which they
denote genera and species. As we have seen in the History, plants as
well as animals are subject to morphological laws; and the names which
are given to organs in consequence of those laws are a part of the
Terminology of the science. Nor is this distinction between
Terminology and Nomenclature without its use; for the rules of
prudence and propriety in the selection of words in the two cases are
different. The Nomenclature of genera and species may be arbitrary and
casual, as is the case to a great extent in Botany and in Zoology,
especially of fossil remains; names being given, for instance, simply
as marks of honor to individuals. But in a Terminology, such a mode of
derivation is not admissible: some significant analogy or idea must be
adopted, at least as the origin of the name, though not necessarily
true in all its applications, as we have seen in the case of the
“squamosal” just quoted. This difference in the rules respecting two
classes of scientific words is stated in the <i>Aphorisms</i> xiii.
and xiv. <i>concerning the Language of Science</i>.</p>
<p>Such a Terminology of the bones of the skeletons of all vertebrates
as Mr. Owen has thus propounded, cannot be otherwise than an immense
acquisition to science, and a means of ascending from what we know
already to wider truths and new morphological doctrines.</p>
<p>With regard to one of these doctrines, the resolution of the human
head into vertebræ, Mr. Owen now regards it as a great truth, and
replies to the objections of Cuvier and M. Agassiz, in detail.<a
id="fnanchor45-B" href="#note45-B"><span
class="fnanchor">45</span></a> He gives a Table in which the Bones of
the Head are resolved into four vertebræ, which he terms the
Occipital, Parietal, Frontal, and Nasal Vertebra, respectively. These
four vertebræ agree in general with what Oken called the Ear-vertebra,
the Jaw-vertebra, the Eye-vertebra, and <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page641">641</a></span> the Nose-vertebra, in his work <i>On the
Signification of the Bones of the Skull</i>, published in 1807: and in
various degrees, with similar views promulgated by Spix (1815),
Bojanus (1818), Geoffroy (1824), Carus <span class="correction"
title="parentheses missing in text">(1828)</span>. And I believe that
these views, bold and fanciful as they at first appeared, have now
been accepted by most of the principal physiologists of our time.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note45-B"
href="#fnanchor45-B">45</a></span> <i>Archetype and Homologies of the
Vertebrate Skeleton</i>. 1848, p. 141.</div>
<p>But another aspect of this generalization has been propounded among
physiologists; and has, like the others, been extended, systematized,
and provided with a convenient language by Mr. Owen. Since animal
skeletons are thus made up of vertebræ and their parts are to be
understood as developements of the parts of vertebræ, Geoffroy (1822),
Carus (1828), Müller (1834), Cuvier (1836), had employed certain terms
while speaking of such developements; Mr. Owen in the <i>Geological
Transactions</i> in 1838, while discussing the osteology of certain
fossil Saurians, used terms of this kind, which are more systematic
than those of his predecessors, and to which he has given currency by
the quantity of valuable knowledge and thought which he has embodied
in them.</p>
<p>According to his Terminology,<a id="fnanchor46-B"
href="#note46-B"><span class="fnanchor">46</span></a> a vertebra, in
its typical completeness, consists of a central part or
<i>centrum</i>; at the back of this, two plates (the <i>neural
apophyses</i>) and a third outward projecting piece (the <i>neural
spine</i>), which three, with the centrum, form a canal for the spinal
marrow; at the front of the centrum two other plates (the <i>hæmal
apophyses</i>) and a projecting piece, forming a canal for a vascular
trunk. Further lateral elements (<i>pleuro-apophyses</i>) and other
projections, are in a certain sense dependent on these principal
bones; besides which the vertebra may support <i>diverging
appendages</i>. These parts of the vertebra are fixed together, so
that a vertebra is by some anatomists described as a single bone; but
the parts now mentioned are usually developed from distinct and
independent centres, and are therefore called by Mr. Owen “autogenous”
elements.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note46-B"
href="#fnanchor46-B">46</a></span> <i>Archetype and Homologies of the
Vertebrate Skeleton</i>. 1848, p. 81.</div>
<p>The <em>General</em> Homology of the vertebral skeleton is the
reference of all the parts of a skeleton to their true types in a
series of vertebræ: and thus, as <em>special</em> homology refers all
the parts of skeletons to a given type of skeleton, say that of Man,
<em>general</em> homology refers all the parts of every skeleton, say
that of Man, to the parts of a series of Vertebræ. And thus as Oken
propounded his views of the Head as a resolution of the Problem of
<i>the Signification of the Bones of the Head</i>, <span
class="pagenum"><a id="v2page642">642</a></span> so have we in like
manner, for the purposes of General Homology, to solve the Problem of
<i>the Signification of Limbs</i>. The whole of the animal being a
string of vertebræ, what are arms and legs, hands and paws, claws and
fingers, wings and fins, and the like? This inquiry Mr. Owen has
pursued as a necessary part of his inquiries. In giving a public
lecture upon the subject in 1849,<a id="fnanchor47-B"
href="#note47-B"><span class="fnanchor">47</span></a> he conceived
that the phrase which I have just employed would not be clearly
apprehended by an English Audience, and entitled his Discourse “On the
<i>Nature</i> of Limbs:” and in this discourse he explained the
modifications by which the various kinds of limbs are derived from
their rudiments in an archetypal skeleton, that is, a mere series of
vertebræ without head, arms, legs, wings, or fins.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note47-B"
href="#fnanchor47-B">47</a></span> <i>On the Nature of Limbs</i>, a
discourse delivered at a Meeting of the Royal Institution, 1849.</div>
<h4 id="final"><i>Final Causes</i></h4>
<p>It has been mentioned in the History that in the discussions which
took place concerning the Unity of Plan of animal structure, this
principle was in some measure put in opposition to the principle of
Final Causes: Morphology was opposed to Teleology. It is natural to
ask whether the recent study of Morphology has affected this
antithesis.</p>
<p>If there be advocates of Final Causes in Physiology who would push
their doctrines so far as to assert that every feature and every
relation in the structure of animals have a purpose discoverable by
man, such reasoners are liable to be perpetually thwarted and
embarrassed by the progress of anatomical knowledge; for this progress
often shows that an arrangement which had been explained and admired
with reference to some purpose, exists also in cases where the purpose
disappears; and again, that what had been noted as a special
teleological arrangement is the result of a general morphological law.
Thus to take an example given by Mr. Owen: that the ossification of
the head originates in several centres, and thus in its early stages
admits of compression, has been pointed out as a provision to
facilitate the birth of viviparous animals; but our view of this
provision is disturbed, when we find that the same mode of the
formation of the bony framework takes place in animals which are born
from an egg. And the number of points from which ossification begins,
depends in a wider sense on the general homology of the animal frame,
according to which each part is composed of a certain number of
autogenous vertebral elements. In this <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page643">643</a></span> way, the admission of a new view as to
Unity of Plan will almost necessarily displace or modify some of the
old views respecting Final Causes.</p>
<p>But though the view of Final Causes is displaced, it is not
obliterated; and especially if the advocate of Purpose is also ready
to admit visible correspondences which have not a discoverable object,
as well as contrivances which have. And in truth, how is it possible
for the student of anatomy to shut his eyes to either of these two
evident aspects of nature? The arm and hand of man are made for taking
and holding, the wing of the sparrow is made for flying; and each is
adapted to its end with subtle and manifest contrivance. There is
plainly Design. But the arm of man and the wing of the sparrow
correspond to each other in the most exact manner, bone for bone.
Where is the Use or the Purpose of this correspondence? If it be said
that there may be a purpose though we do not see it, that is granted.
But Final Causes <em>for us</em> are contrivances of which <em>we
see</em> the end; and nothing is added to the evidence of Design by
the perception of a unity of plan which in no way tends to promote the
design.</p>
<p>It may be said that the design appears in the modification of the
plan in special ways for special purposes;&#8212;that the vertebral
plan of an animal being given, the fore limbs are modified in Man and
in Sparrow, as the nature and life of each require. And this is truly
said; and is indeed the truth which we are endeavoring to bring into
view:&#8212;that there are in such speculations, two elements; one
given, the other to be worked out from our examination of the case;
the <em>datum</em> and the <em>problem</em>; the homology and the
teleology.</p>
<p>Mr. Owen, who has done so much for the former of these portions of
our knowledge, has also been constantly at the same time contributing
to the other. While he has been aiding our advances towards the Unity
of Nature, he has been ever alive to the perception of an Intelligence
which pervades Nature. While his morphological doctrines have moved
the point of view from which he sees Design, they have never obscured
his view of it, but, on the contrary, have led him to present it to
his readers in new and striking aspects. Thus he has pointed out the
final purposes in the different centres of ossification of the long
bones of the limbs of mammals, and shown how and why they differ in
this respect from reptiles (<i>Archetype</i>, p. 104). And in this way
he has been able to point out the insufficiency of the rule laid down
both by Geoffroy St. Hilaire and Cuvier, for ascertaining the true
number of bones in each species. <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page644">644</a></span></p>
<p>Final Causes, or Evidences of Design, appear, as we have said, not
merely as contrivances for evident purposes, but as modifications of a
given general Plan for special given ends. If the general Plan be
discovered after the contrivance has been noticed, the discovery may
at first seem to obscure our perception of Purpose; but it will soon
be found that it merely transfers us to a higher point of view. The
adaptation of the Means to the End remains, though the Means are parts
of a more general scheme than we were aware of. No generalization of
the Means can or ought permanently to shake our conviction of the End;
because we must needs suppose that the Intelligence which contemplates
the End is an intelligence which can see at a glance along a vista of
Means, however long and complex. And on the other hand, no special
contrivance, however clear be its arrangement, can be unconnected with
the general correspondences and harmonies by which all parts of nature
are pervaded and bound together. And thus no luminous teleological
point can be extinguished by homology; nor, on the other hand, can it
be detached from the general expanse of homological light.</p>
<p>The reference to Final Causes is sometimes spoken of as
unphilosophical, in consequence of Francis Bacon’s comparison of Final
Causes in Physics to Vestal Virgins devoted to God, and barren. I have
repeatedly shown that, in Physiology, almost all the great discoveries
which have been made, have been made by the assumption of a purpose in
animal structures. With reference to Bacon’s simile, I have elsewhere
said that if he had had occasion to develope its bearings, full of
latent meaning as his similes so often are, he would probably have
said that to those Final Causes barrenness was no reproach, seeing
they ought to be not the Mothers but the Daughters of our Natural
Sciences; and that they were barren, not by imperfection of their
nature, but in order that they might be kept pure and undefiled, and
so fit ministers in the temple of God. I might add that in Physiology,
if they are not Mothers, they are admirable Nurses; skilful and
sagacious in perceiving the signs of pregnancy, and helpful in
bringing the Infant Truth into the light of day.</p>
<p>There is another aspect of the doctrine of the Archetypal Unity of
Composition of Animals, by which it points to an Intelligence from
which the frame of nature proceeds; namely this:&#8212;that the
Archetype of the Animal Structure being of the nature of an
<i>Idea</i>, implies a mind in which this Idea existed; and that thus
Homology itself points the way to the Divine Mind. But while we
acknowledge the full <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page645">645</a></span> value of this view of theological
bearing of physiology, we may venture to say that it is a view quite
different from that which is described by speaking of “Final Causes,”
and one much more difficult to present in a lucid manner to ordinary
minds.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="sc">WITH</span> regard to Geology, as a
Palætiological Science, I do not know that any new light of an
important kind has been thrown upon the general doctrines of the
science. Surveys and examinations of special phenomena and special
districts have been carried on with activity and intelligence; and the
animals of which the remains people the strata, have been
reconstructed by the skill and knowledge of zoologists:&#8212;of such
reconstructions we have, for instance, a fine assemblage in the
publications of the Palæontological Society. But the great questions
of the manner of the creation and succession of animal and vegetable
species upon the earth remain, I think, at the point at which they
were when I published the last edition of the History.</p>
<p>I may notice the views propounded by some chemists of certain
bearings of Mineralogy upon Geology. As we have, in mineral masses,
organic remains of former organized beings, so have we crystalline
remains of former crystals; namely, what are commonly called
<i>pseudomorphoses</i>&#8212;the shape of one crystal in the substance
of another. M. G. Bischoff<a id="fnanchor48-B" href="#note48-B"><span
class="fnanchor">48</span></a> considers the study of pseudomorphs as
important in geology, and as frequently the only means of tracing
processes which have taken place and are still going on in the mineral
kingdom.</p>
<div class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="note48-B"
href="#fnanchor48-B">48</a></span> <i>Chemical and Physical
Geology</i>.</div>
<p>I may notice also Professor Breithaupt’s researches on the order of
succession of different minerals, by observing the mode in which they
occur and the order in which different crystals have been deposited,
promise to be of great use in following out the geological changes
which the crust of the globe has undergone. (<i>Die Paragenesis der
Mineralien</i>. Freiberg. 1849.)</p>
<p>In conjunction with these may be taken M. de Senarmont’s
experiments on the formation of minerals in veins; and besides
Bischoff’s <span class="pagenum"><a id="v2page647">647</a></span>
<i>Chemical Geology</i>, Sartorius von Walterhausen’s Observations on
the occurrence of minerals in Amygdaloid.</p>
<p>As a recent example of speculations concerning Botanical
Palætiology, I may give Dr. Hooker’s views of the probable history of
the Flora of the Pacific.</p>
<p>In speculating upon this question, Dr. Hooker is led to the
discussion of geological doctrines concerning the former continuity of
tracts of land which are now separate, the elevation of low lands into
mountain ranges in the course of ages, and the like. We have already
seen, in the speculations of the late lamented Edward Forbes, (see
Book xviii. <a href="#v2page574">chap. vi.</a> of this History,) an
example of a hypothesis propounded to account for the existing Flora
of England: a hypothesis, namely, of a former Connexion of the West of
the British Isles with Portugal, of the Alps of Scotland with those of
Scandinavia, and of the plains of East Anglia with those of Holland.
In like manner Dr. Hooker says (p. xxi.) that he was led to speculate
on the possibility of the plants of the Southern Ocean being the
remains of a Flora that had once spread over a larger and more
continuous tract of land than now exists in the ocean; and that the
peculiar Antarctic genera and species may be the vestiges of a Flora
characterized by the predominance of plants which are now scattered
throughout the Southern islands. He conceives this hypothesis to be
greatly supported by the observations and reasonings of Mr. Darwin,
tending to show that such risings and sinkings are in active progress
over large portions of the continents and islands of the Southern
hemisphere: and by the speculations of Sir C. Lyell respecting the
influence of climate on the migrations of plants and animals, and the
influence of geological changes upon climate.</p>
<p>In Zoology I may notice (following Mr. Owen)<a id="fnanchor49-B"
href="#note49-B"><span class="fnanchor">49</span></a> recent
discoveries of the remains of the animals which come nearest to man in
their structure. At the time of Cuvier’s death, in 1832, no evidence
had been obtained of fossil Quadrumana; and he supposed that these, as
well as Bimana, were of very recent introduction. Soon after, in the
oldest (eocene) tertiary deposits of Suffolk, remains were found
proving the existence of a monkey of the genus Macacus. In the
Himalayan tertiaries were found petrified bones of a Semnopithecus; in
Brazil, remains of an extinct platyrhine monkey of great size; and
lastly, in the middle tertiary series of the South of France, was
discovered a fragment of the jaw of the long-armed ape
(<i>Hylobates</i>). But no fossil human <span class="pagenum"><a
id="v2page648">648</a></span> remains have been discovered in the
regularly deposited layers of any divisions (not even the pleiocene) of
the tertiary series; and thus we have evidence that the placing of man
on the earth was the last and peculiar act of Creation.</p>

<p>Whewell’s book was originally published in 3 volumes in London in
1837. A second edition appeared in 1847, and a third in 1857. A
2-volume version of the 3rd edition was published in New York in 1858,
reprinted 1875. This Project Gutenberg text, combining both volumes in
sequence, was derived from the 1875 version, relying upon resources
kindly provided by the Internet Archive. In so doing, the Contents of
Volume 2 have been moved to follow the Contents of Volume 1.</p>
<p>Three items have been added to the Contents of the First Volume;
they are marked off by ~ ~. Whewell’s additions to the 3rd edition
were printed by way of appendices to the volumes. An indication that
such an addition may be found has been given, again marked off by ~ ~,
and linked to the relevant text. Any infelicities in these and other
internal links are the transcriber’s responsibility.</p>
<p>Where ditto signs were used in the text, the material has been
repeated in full.</p>
<p>Printed page numbers have been transcribed in colour. Where words
were hyphenated across pages, the number has been placed before the word.</p>
<p>Fractions have been transcribed as numerator⁄denominator,
occasionally using parentheses to disambiguate. The original sometimes
has numerator over a line with denominator below, at other times
numerator hyphen denominator.</p>
<p>Footnotes in the original text were numbered by chapter; here they
have been numbered by Book (counting the preface and the appendices to
each volume as a separate book and incorporating the Introduction with
Book I). They are placed after the paragraph in which they occur.</p>
<p class="end">Corrections to the text are flagged in the .htm version by dotted red
underline, on mouse-over revealing the nature of the change. They were
usually confirmed by reference to English printings of the text.
Inconsistencies, especially with respect to accents and formatting,
are numerous and have in general not been adjusted, though Greek
quotations have been checked against other versions where
available. Nor have Whewell's unbalanced quotation marks been modernised.
The English versions have been used to restore Whewell’s “gesperrt” emphases
in some Greek passages.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
